Mongeau, R., et al. (2010). "5-HT2C receptor activation prevents stress-induced enhancement of brain 5-HT turnover and extracellular levels in the mouse brain: modulation by chronic paroxetine treatment." Journal of Neurochemistry 115(2): 438-449.

	Stress is known to activate the central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system, and this is probably part of a coping response involving several 5-HT receptors. Although 5-HT2C receptors are well known to be implicated in anxiety, their participation in stress-induced changes had not been investigated in parallel at both behavioral and neurochemical levels. We show here that the preferential 5-HT2C receptor agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine, as well as restraint stress increased anxiety in the mouse social interaction test. The selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, SB 242,084, prevented both of these anxiogenic effects. Restraint stress increased 5-HT turnover in various brain areas, and this effect was prevented by the 5-HT2B/2C receptor agonist RO 60-0175 (1 mg/kg), but not the preferential 5-HT2A agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (1 mg/kg), and in contrast potentiated by SB 242,084 (1 mg/kg), which also blocked the effect of RO 60-0175. Using microdialysis, RO 60-0175 was shown to inhibit cortical 5-HT overflow in stressed mice when 5-HT reuptake was blocked locally. Chronic paroxetine prevented both the anxiogenic effect of m-chlorophenylpiperazine and the inhibitory effect of RO 60-0175 on locomotion and stress-induced increase in 5-HT turnover. The anxiolytic action of chronic paroxetine might be associated with an enhancement of 5-HT neurotransmission caused by a decreased 5-HT2C receptor-mediated inhibition of stress-induced increase in 5-HT release.
