	There is a growing acceptance that serotonergic pathways to the suprachiasmatic nucleus play an important role in the mediation and modulation of light entrainment of rhythms. In this study administration of the 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI, 0.5 mg/kg) at mid dark caused a phase shift in the onset of the urinary excretion of 6-sulphatoxymelatonin in rats that was sustained for at least 8 days and was blocked by the specific 5-HT(2C) antagonist SB-242084. Administration of DOI (2 mg/kg) across the night resulted in the appearance of c-FOS in the nucleus of cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus during subjective darkness, but did not cause induction at the time of expected lights on (CT0). By contrast light exposure induced c-fos throughout the night including CT0. Administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (3 mg/kg) prior to light pulses had no effect on c-fos in the first part of the night, but towards the expected time of lights on, became progressively more potent, such that by CT0, light induction of c-fos was almost completely inhibited. These results provide further evidence that serotonin plays a role in the mediation of light effects on rhythms in the rat.
