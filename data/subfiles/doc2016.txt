Claustre, Y., et al. (1991). "EFFECT OF THE PUTATIVE 5-HT1A RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST NAN-190 ON RAT-BRAIN SEROTONERGIC TRANSMISSION." European Journal of Pharmacology 204(1): 71-77.

	Based on the fact that 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4(4-(2-phtalimido)butyl)piperazine (NAN-190), a high-affinity ligand for 5-HT1A and alpha-1-adrenoceptors, antagonizes the behavioural effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), it has been suggested that this drug behaves as a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. In the present study we examined the effects of this putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonist on rat brain serotonergic neurotransmission. In hippocampal slices of immature rats, NAN-190 but not prazosin potently antagonized (IC50 = 29 nM) the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT (1-mu-M) on carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover but (up to 1-mu-M) failed to alter the carbachol response. Similarly, NAN-190 (0.1-mu-M) almost totally prevented the inhibition by 8-OH-DPAT (1-mu-M) of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in adult rat hippocampal slices but, per se, was without effect on the forskolin response. These results indicate that NAN-190 is a potent antagonist at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in vitro. However, NAN-190 also potently antagonized (IC50 = 0.16 nM) the stimulation by norepinephrine of phosphoinositide turnover in rat cortical slices. In this respect NAN-190 was a 250-fold more potent antagonist than prazosin (IC50 = 49 nM). Thus, in addition to its 5-HT1A receptor antagonist properties, NAN-190 has potent alpha-1-adrenoceptor blocking properties. Systemic administration of NAN-190 to adult rats caused a diminution of serotonin synthesis in the frontal cortex (-39% at 1 mg/kg i.p.), of extracellular 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels (as measured by voltammetry) in the dorsal raphe (-50% at 0.3 mg/kg i.p.) and of extracellular serotonin levels (as measured by microdialysis) in the hippocampus (-45% at 0.3 mg/kg s.c.) as did 8-OH-DPAT. The alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.3-1 mg/kg) reproduced the effects of NAN-190 on the above-mentioned parameters. It is concluded that while NAN-190 blocks postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses in the hippocampus, it reduces serotonin turnover in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, probably as a consequence of its alpha-1-adrenoceptor-blocking properties.
