Nirogi, R., et al. (2013). "In-vivo rat striatal 5-HT4 receptor occupancy using non-radiolabelled SB207145." J Pharm Pharmacol 65(5): 704-712.

	OBJECTIVES: The objective of the current investigation was to develop a simple, rapid method for determining in-vivo 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 receptor (5-HT4 R) occupancy in rat brain using non-radiolabelled SB207145 as a tracer for accelerating the drug discovery process. METHODS: In-vivo tracer optimization studies for tracer dose, survival intervals and brain distribution profile were carried out in rats. The tracer was pharmacologically validated using potent well-characterized 5-HT4 R ligands. The brain regional concentrations of tracer (SB207145); plasma and brain concentrations of 5-HT4 R ligands were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a tandem mass spectrometric detector (LC-MS/MS). KEY FINDINGS: SB207145 showed a higher specific binding in striatum (1.96 ng/g) and lower binding in cerebellum (0.66 ng/g), which is consistent with findings of other published 5-HT4 R expression studies. Pretreatment with potent 5-HT4 ligands dose-dependently reduced striatal SB207145 concentration and the effective dose to achieve 50% receptor occupancy (ED50 ) values were 4.8, 2.0, 7.4, 9.9, 3.8 and 0.02 mg/kg for GR113808, piboserod, prucalopride, RS67333, TD8954 and PF04995274, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Results from the mass spectrometry approach to determine 5-HT4 R occupancy in rat brain are comparable with those reported using radiolabelled scintillation spectroscopy methods. In conclusion, the LC-MS/MS characterization permits use of tracer at a preclinical stage in high-throughput fashion as well as characterization of target expression.
