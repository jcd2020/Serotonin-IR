Fujio, M., et al. (2002). "Synthesis and evaluation of C-11-labeled (S)-N-{ 1-(2-phenylethyl) pyrrolidin-2-yl methyl}-3-methylthiobenzamide as a PET 5-HT1A receptor ligand." Nucl Med Biol 29(6): 657-663.

	We prepared 5-HT1A receptor ligands (S)-N-{[1-(2-phenylethyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl]methyl}-3-[C-11]methylthiobenzamide ([C-11](S)PPMMB) (Ki = 4.3 nM) and the less active [C-11](R)-PPMMB (Ki = 160 nM) by reduction of the disulfide dimer and subsequent [C-11]methylation of demethyl (S)- and (R)-PPMMB, respectively. Both radioligands showed similar brain distribution in mice with relatively higher affinity for the hippocampus being rich in 5-HT1A receptors than for other brain regions. Uptake of [C-11](S)-PPMMB was not reduced by carrier-loading nor by pretreatment with 5-HT1A receptor ligands. [C-11](S)-PPMMB is therefore not a suitable radioligand for mapping 5-HT1A receptors using positron emission tomography. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.
