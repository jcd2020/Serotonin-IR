Cicinsain, L. and P. Jenner (1992). "LOCALIZATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF 5-HT(3) RECEPTORS IN THE FOREBRAIN OF THE RAT IDENTIFIED BY THE SPECIFIC BINDING OF H-3 GR-65630." Neuroscience Research Communications 10(1): 17-25.

	The specific binding of the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [H-3]GR 65630, was analyzed in different rat brain areas using an homogenate radioligand binding technique. [H-3]GR 65630 labelled a single, saturable binding site (defined by metoclopramide 10(-4) M) in homogenates prepared from the rat prefrontal cortex (K(d) = 0.193 +/-0.029 nM, B(max) = 0.772 +/- 0.090 pmol/g wet weight of tissue, M +/- SD, N = 6), entorhinal cortex (K(d) = 0.150 +/- 0.026 nM, B(max) = 1.562 +/- 0.186 pmol/g, M +/- SD, N = 7), amygdala (K(d) = 0.172 +/- 0.021 nM, B(max) = 0.818 +/- 0.061 pmol/g, M +/- SD, N = 5), hippocampus (K(d) = 0.141 +/- 0.030 nM, B(max) = 0.586 +/- 0.143 pmol/g, M +/- SD, N = 5) and whole cortex (K(d) = 0.182 +/- 0.019 nM, B(max) = 0.740 +/- 0.14 pmol/g, M +/- SD, N = 3). Specific binding ranged from 63% of total binding in rat entorhinal cortex to 22% in the hippocampus. Inter- and intra-experimental variabilities of the binding characteristics were similar in all regions examined.
