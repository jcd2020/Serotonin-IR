Lopez-Gimenez, J. F., et al. (1998). "H-3 MDL 100,907 labels 5-HT2A serotonin receptors selectively in primate brain." Neuropharmacology 37(9): 1147-1158.

	The selective antagonist for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor MDL 100,907, recently characterized autoradiographically in rat brain, has been characterized as a radioligand for the visualization of this receptor in human and monkey brain. In both species [H-3]MDL 100,907 binding to brain sections was saturable, had sub-nanomolar affinity (K-d = 0.14-0.19 nM in human brain; K-d= 0.16-0.19 nM in monkey brain) and presented a pharmacological profile consistent with its binding to 5-HT2A receptors (rank order of affinity for [H-3]MDL 100,907-labeled receptors: MDL 100,907 > spiperone > ketanserin > mesulergine). The autoradiographical signal obtained with [H-3]MDL 100,907 was compared to the signal obtained with [H-3]ketanserin, [H-3]RP62203 and [H-3]mesulergine in both species, and to the distribution of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA as determined by in situ hybridization in monkey brain. At variance with the other radioligands, [3H]MDL 100,907 showed a single population of binding sites with extremely low levels of non-specific binding. As expected, mesulergine showed law affinity for [3H]MDL 100,907-labeled receptors and the autoradiographic pattern shown by [H-3]mesulergine confirmed the lack of labeling of the 5-HT2A receptor by this radioligand in primate brain. The similarity of the distribution of [H-3]MDL 100,907-labeled receptors and 5-HT2A mRNA in monkey brain, supports the selectivity of this radioligand for 5-HT2A receptors and suggests a somatodendritic localization of these receptors. The present results confirm [3H]MDL 100,907 as the radioligand of choice at present for the autoradiographic visualization of 5-HT2A receptors in mammalian brain including post-mortem human brain.
