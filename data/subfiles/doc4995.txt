	Gender differences in psychiatric disorders are considered to be associated with the serotonergic (5-HTergic) system; however the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, possible involvement of the median raphe nucleus (MRN)-hippocampus 5-HTergic system in gender-specific emotional regulation was investigated, focusing on synaptic plasticity in rats. A behavioral study using a contextual fear conditioning (CFC) paradigm showed that the females exhibited low anxiety-like behavior. Extracellular 5-HT levels in the hippocampus were increased by CFC only in the males. Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampal CA1 field was suppressed after CFC in the males, which was mimicked by the synaptic response to MRN electrical stimulation. In the MRN, 5-HT immunoreactive cells significantly increased in the females compared with those in the males. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor agonists tandospirone (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and 8-OH DPAT (3 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly suppressed LTP induction in the males. Synaptic responses to CFC and 5-HT1A receptor interventions were not observed in the females. These results suggest that the metaplastic 5-HTergic mechanism via 5-HT1A receptors in the MRN-hippocampus pathway is a key component for gender-specific emotional regulation and may be a cause of psychiatric disorders associated with vulnerability or resistance to emotional stress.
