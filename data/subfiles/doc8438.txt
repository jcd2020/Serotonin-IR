	This study investigated the effects of bilateral injections of serotonergic receptor agonist and antagonist into the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) on the ingestion of water and 0.3 M NaCl induced by intracerebroventricular angiotensin II (ANG II) or by combined subcutaneous injections of the diuretic furosemide (Furo) and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril (Cap). Rats had stainless steel cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN and into the left lateral ventricle. Bilateral LPBN pretreatment with the serotonergic 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist methysergide (4 micrograms/200 nl each site) increased 0.3 M NaCl and water intakes induced by intracerebroventricular ANG II (50 ng/microliter) and 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by subcutaneous Furo + Cap. Pretreatment with bilateral LPBN injections of a serotonergic 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist DOI (5 micrograms/200 nl) significantly reduced 0.3 M NaCl intake induced by subcutaneous Furo + Cap. Pretreatment with methysergide or DOI into the LPBN produced no significant changes in the water intake induced by subcutaneous Furo + Cap. These results suggest that serotonergic mechanisms associated with the LPBN may have inhibitory roles in water and sodium ingestion in rats.
