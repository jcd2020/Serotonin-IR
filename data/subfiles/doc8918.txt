Moret, C. and M. Briley (1997). "Ex vivo inhibitory effect of the 5-HT uptake blocker citalopram on 5-HT synthesis." J Neural Transm (Vienna) 104(2-3): 147-160.

	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) synthesis was determined in vivo by measuring the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in rat frontal cortex after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by administrative of m-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015) (100 mg/kg, i.p.). The selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, citalopram, the 5-HT1A agonists, (+/-) 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), ipsapirone, gepirone and the 5-HT1A/B agonist, 7-trifluoromethyl-4(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl-pyrolo[1,2-a]-quinox ali ne (CGS 12066B), the 5-HT1A/B ligands and beta-adrenoceptor antagonists, (+/-) pindolol and (+/-) alprenolol, and the non-selective 5-HT ligands, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and metergoline, all inhibited the synthesis of 5-HT. The 5-HT1A/5-HT2 antagonist, spiperone, alone, had no effect on basal 5-HT synthesis, however it attenuated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT by 56% and CGS 12066B by 39% but only barely that of citalopram by 17%. The selective 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100635, which did not modify by itself 5-HT synthesis, had no effect on citalopram-induced reduction of 5-HT synthesis. Neither the 5-HT2 agonist, (+/-)1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-indophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) nor the 5-HT2 antagonist, ritanserin, had any effect on the synthesis of 5-HT. In addition, ritanserin did not modify the inhibitory effect of citalopram. Methiothepin was the only compound to increase 5-HT synthesis. These results suggest that the effect of citalopram on the synthesis of 5-HT is not mediated by 5-HT1A or 5-HT2 receptors and that other receptors may be involved.
