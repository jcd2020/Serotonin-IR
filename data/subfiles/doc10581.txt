	Lurasidone, a novel second-generation antipsychotic agent, exerts antidepressant actions in patients suffering from bipolar type I disorder. Lurasidone acts as a high affinity antagonist at multiple monoamine receptors, particularly 5-HT2A, 5-HT7, D-2 and alpha(2) receptors, and as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors. Accumulating evidence indicates therapeutic actions by monoaminergic antidepressants are mediated via alterations of glutamate receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Here, we used mice and investigated the effects of chronic oral administration of vehicle, lurasidone (3 or 10 mg/kg) or fluoxetine (20 mg/kg) in the novelty induced hypophagia test, a behavioral test sensitive to chronic antidepressant treatment. We subsequently performed biochemical analyses on NMDA receptor subunits and associated proteins. Both lurasidone and fluoxetine reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-induced hypophagia test. Western blotting experiments showed that both lurasidone and fluoxetine decreased the total levels of NR1, NR2A and NR2B subunits of NMDA receptors and PSD-95 (PostSynaptic Density-95) in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Taken together, these data indicate that antidepressant/anxiolytic-like effects of lurasidone, as well as fluoxetine, could involve reduced NMDA receptor-mediated signal transduction, particularly in pathways regulated by PSD-95, in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.
