Schoeffter, P. and D. Hoyer (1989). "Interaction of arylpiperazines with 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C and 5-HT1D receptors: do discriminatory 5-HT1B receptor ligands exist?" Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 339(6): 675-683.

	The effects of several putative 5-HT1 receptor-subtype selective ligands were investigated in biochemical models for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT1D receptors (inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in calf hippocampus, rat and calf substantia nigra, respectively) and 5-HT1C receptors (stimulation of inositol phosphates production in pig choroid plexus). Following compounds were studied: 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine), TFMPP (1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine), mCPP (1-(m-chlorophenyl)piperazine), CGS 12066 (7-trifluoromethyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-pyrrolo[1,2-a] quinoxaline 1), isamoltane (CGP 361A, 1-(2-(1-pyrrolyl)-phenoxy)-3-isopropylamino-2-propranol), quipazine, 1-NP (1-(1-naphthyl)piperazine), and PAPP (LY165163, 1-[2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)- piperazine). Among reported 5-HT1B receptor selective drugs, TFMPP had similar potency at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors, mCPP did not separate between 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors, CGS 12066 was equipotent at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, and isamoltane was only slightly 5-HT1B versus 5-HT1A selective. Quipazine showed equal potency at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C receptors and 1-NP did not discriminate between the four receptor subtypes. PAPP described as 5-HT1A receptor selective, was equally potent at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1D receptors. The potencies determined in second messenger studies were in good agreement with the affinity values determined in radioligand binding studies. Thus 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C and 5-HT1D receptors have different pharmacological profiles as predicted from radioligand binding studies. Despite claims to the contrary, none of the tested compounds had actual selectivity for a given 5-HT1 receptor subtype.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
