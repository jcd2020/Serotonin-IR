	Serotonin (5-HT) modulates pain and anxiety from within the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG). In the present study, the effects of 5-HT- and 5-HT1/2 subtype-selective ligands on rat PAG neurons were examined using whole cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices. In voltage clamp, 5-HT produced outward and inward currents in distinct subpopulations of neurons that varied throughout different subregions of the PAG. The 5-HT1A agonist R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (1 mu M) produced outward currents in subpopulations of PAG neurons. By contrast, sumatriptan (1 mu M) and other 5-HT1B, (-D), and (-F) subtype agonists had little or no postsynaptic activity. The 5-HT2A/C agonists DOI (3 mu M) and TCB-2 (1 mu M) produced inward currents in subpopulations of PAG neurons, and DOI enhanced evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents via a presynaptic mechanism. In current clamp, both R(+)-8-OH-DPAT and sumatriptan produced an excitatory increase in evoked mixed postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). In addition, R(+)-8-OH-DPAT, but not sumatriptan, directly hyperpolarized PAG neurons. By contrast, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI depolarized subpopulations of neurons and produced an inhibitory decrease in evoked mixed PSPs. These findings indicate that 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D ligands have partly overlapping inhibitory effects on membrane excitability and synaptic transmission within the PAG, which are functionally opposed by 5-HT2A/C actions in specific PAG subregions.
