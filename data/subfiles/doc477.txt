Auerbach, S. B., et al. (1995). "Differential inhibition of serotonin release by 5-HT and NA reuptake blockers after systemic administration." Neuropharmacology 34(1): 89-96.

	The inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) release produced by antidepressants varying in relative selectivity for blocking uptake of 5-HT and noradrenaline (NA) was compared. Release was measured by microdialysis in anesthetized rats with nerve terminal 5-HT uptake inhibited by local infusion of citalopram (1 microM) through a dialysis probe in hippocampus. With 5-HT uptake first blocked in hippocampus, systemic injection of uptake inhibitors produced decreases in dialysate 5-HT, presumably due to autoreceptor stimulation in the raphe. The largest decreases (about 60-70%) in 5-HT were produced by the selective 5-HT uptake inhibitors sertraline, paroxetine and citalopram. Nonselective blockers caused less suppression of release. Thus, the maximum decrease in 5-HT was 35% after clomipramine, a less selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, and < or = 30% after the nonselective 5-HT/NA uptake blockers imipramine and amitriptyline, 5-HT was not decreased after maprotiline, a selective NA uptake blocker. Pretreatment with (+)WAY100135 to block 5-HT1A autoreceptors, abolished the inhibition of 5-HT release produced by systemic sertraline, clomipramine and imipramine. One explanation for the difference between selective and nonselective inhibitors with respect to central 5-HT release, is the excitatory effect of (alpha 1) adrenergic receptor stimulation on 5-HT neuronal discharge. However, pretreatment with alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine to deplete NA, did not influence the inhibition of 5-HT release produced by imipramine.
