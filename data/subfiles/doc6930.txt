	Pharmacological techniques have defined the existence of two different alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, the alpha(1A) and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor subtypes and both of these receptors have been cloned in addition to a cloned alpha(1d)-adrenoceptor. A subpopulation of interneurons in layer III of the rat piliform cortex that are excited by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) via 5-HT2A receptors an also excited by norepinephrine via alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. In the present study we determined the pA(2) values against the norepinephrine-mediated excitation of piriform cortical interneurons for a number of antagonists that are (1) not selective for alpha(1A)- or alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors (prazosin), (2) selective for alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors (5-methyl urapidil, 2-(2,6-dimethoxy-phenoxyethyl)-aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane hydrochloride (WB 4101), benoxathian, phentolamine) and (3) selective for cu,,-adrenoceptors (spiperone and risperidone). The pA(2) values for the antagonist blockade of norepinephrine-mediated interneuron excitation were significantly correlated to literature values for the pK(i) values of antagonist binding to the alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor (r = 0.919) and the cloned alpha(1b)-adrenoceptor (r = 0.839) but were not correlated to the pK(i) values of antagonist binding to the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor or the cloned alpha(1a)- and alpha(1d)-adrenoceptor. Thus, we conclude that this population of piriform cortical interneurons is excited by norepinephrine via alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors.
