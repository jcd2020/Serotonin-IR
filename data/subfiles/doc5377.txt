Kakigami, T., et al. (1998). "Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of 3-Substituted benzamide, benzo [b]furan-7-carboxamide, 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]furan-77-carboxamide, and indole-5-carboxamide derivatives as selective serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonists." Chem Pharm Bull (Tokyo) 46(1): 42-52.

	The title compounds (6-9) were prepared and evaluated for serotonin 5-HT4 agonistic activity in in vitro tests. Introducing a propyl or allyl group at the 3-position of benzamide caused only a slight enhancement of agonistic activity. Construction of the benzo[b]furan skeleton and 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b]furan skeleton caused a significant enhancement of the activity. 4-amino-N-[2-(1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-5-yl)ethyl]-5-chloro- 2-methylbenzo[b]furan-7-carboxamide (7b) hemifumarate was as potent as cisapride. 4-Amino-N-[2-(1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-5-yl)ethyl]-5-chloro- 2,3-dihydro-2-methylbenzo[b]furan-7-carboxamide (8a) hemifumarate, 4-amino-N-[2-(1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-5-yl)ethyl]-5-chloro- 2,3-dihydro-2-ethylbenzo[b]furan-7-carboxamide (8c) hemifumarate, and 4-amino-N-[2-(1-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-5-yl)ethyl]-5-chloro- 2,3-dimethylbenzo[b]furan-7-carboxamide (8d) hemifumarate were more potent than cisapride. Furthermore, 8a hemifumarate was free from dopamine D1, D2, serotonin 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and muscarine M1, M2 receptor binding activity in the in in vitro tests. On the other hand, construction of the indole skeleton caused a remarkable decrease in activity.
