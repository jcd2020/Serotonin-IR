	BACKGROUND/AIMS: Serotonin 5HT2A and 5HT1A receptors (5HT2AR, 5HT1AR) have the closest connection to anxiety-like behavior in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we explored the connection between 5HT2A and 5HT1A receptors and anxiety-like behavior. METHODS: In the PTSD animal model, mice were exposed to conditioned fear stress coupled with single-prolonged stress (CF+SPS). Post stress infliction and behavioral tests, of which include open field, freezing behavior and elevated plus maze tests were carried out to examine establishment of the proposed model. Both Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence labeling were used to evaluate protein expressions of 5HT2AR, 5HT1AR, ERK1, ERK2 and c-Myc in the hippocampi of the mice and RT Q-PCR was employed for evaluation of the relative mRNA expressions. RESULTS: Based on the model established utilizing the CF+SPS procedure, we found 5HT2AR to play a positive role on anxiety-like behavior by inhibiting the expression of 5HT1AR. In addition, the ERK-c-Myc pathway elicited the effect of 5HT2AR and 5HT1AR on anxiety-like behavior in PTSD, 5-HT enhanced the anxiety-like behavior through both 5HT2AR and 5HT1AR. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest competive interaction between 5HT2AR and 5HT1AR actively affects anxiety-like behavior in the hippocampi of PTSD mice via the ERK pathway.
