Miyawaki, T., et al. (2001). "Rostral ventral medulla 5-HT1A receptors selectively inhibit the somatosympathetic reflex." Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 280(5): R1261-1268.

	The role of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) on somatosympathetic, baroreceptor, and chemoreceptor reflexes was examined in anesthetized rats. Microinjection of the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-di-n-propylamino tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) decreased arterial blood pressure and splanchnic sympathetic nerve activity (SNA). Electrical stimulation of the hindlimb evoked early and late excitatory sympathetic responses. Bilateral microinjection in the RVLM of 8-OH-DPAT markedly attenuated both the early and late responses. This potent inhibition of the somatosympathetic reflex persisted even after SNA and arterial blood pressure returned to preinjection levels. Preinjection of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist NAN-190 in the RVLM blocked the sympathoinhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT and attenuated the inhibitory effect on the somatosympathetic reflex. 8-OH-DPAT injected in the RVLM did not affect baroreceptor or chemoreceptor reflexes. Our findings suggest that activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the RVLM exerts a potent, selective inhibition on the somatosympathetic reflex.
