Khawaja, X., et al. (1997). "Pharmacological characterization of recombinant human 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptors using a novel antagonist radioligand, H-3 way-100635." Life Sci 60(9): 653-665.

	The ligand binding characteristics of the recombinant human 5-HT1A receptor stably expressed in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line are described using a selective agonist, [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, and a novel antagonist radioligand, [H-3]WAY-100635. The association of [H-3]WAY-100635 was a time- and temperature-dependent process. Mn2+>Ca2+>Mg2+ reduced the specific [H-3]WAY-100635 binding in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas Na+ and K+ were ineffective. Scatchard analyses revealed a homogeneous population of [H-3]WAY-100635 recognition sites (Kd=0.32nM; Bmax=162fmol/mg of protein). Addition of divalent cations to the incubation medium produced a two-fold decrease in the binding affinity of [H-3]WAY-100635 with no significant change in Bmax; GTP gamma S had no effect on Kd or Bmax parameters. [H-3]WAY-100635 displayed a higher affinity (2-3 fold) for the 5-HT1A Site when compared with [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding under similar incubation conditions. Furthermore, [H-3] 8-OH-DPAT labelled approximately 53-61% of total 5-HT1A sites recognised by [H-3]WAY-100635. The competition binding profiles of [H-3]WAY-100635 and [H-3]8-OH-DPAT were highly correlated and consistent with the recognition of 5-HT1A receptors. Agonist competition curves with [H-3]WAY-100635 were best-resolved into high- and low-affinity binding states, whereas partial agonist and antagonist curves were best-fit to one-site binding models. A significant correlation between the respective affinities of a range of agonists and antagonists at recombinant human and rodent hippocampal 5-HT1A binding sites (previously published) was also observed using [H-3]WAY-100635 (r=0.92; P<0.0005) and [H-3]8-OH-DPAT (r=0.96; P<0.0005). The availability of a novel, high-affinity antagonist radioligand, [H-3]WAY-100635, will provide a useful tool for the further characterisation of 5-HT1A receptor pharmacology.
