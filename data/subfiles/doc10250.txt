Poeschla, B., et al. (1993). "CHOLECYSTOKININ-INDUCED SATIETY DEPENDS ON ACTIVATION OF 5-HT1C-RECEPTORS." American Journal of Physiology 264(1): R62-R64.

	To investigate the dependence of the satiating action of cholecystokinin on serotonergic function in rats, we examined the effects of systemic pretreatment with serotonin (5-HT) antagonists of varying selectivity for 5-HT receptor subtypes on suppression of food intake induced by systemic administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8). Mianserin, a 5-HT1C/2-selective antagonist, significantly attenuated the satiating action of CCK-8. Ketanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist, and three 5-HT3 antagonists, MDL-72222, ICS 205-930, and ondansetron, however, had no effect on the satiating action of CCK-8. These results demonstrate that the satiating action of exogenous CCK depends on activation of 5-HT1 (probably 5-HT1c) receptors and that activation of 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 receptors is not required.
