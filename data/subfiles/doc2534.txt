	Serotonin (5-HT) applied at 1, 3, and 10 mu M into the striatum of halothane-anesthetized rats by in vivo microdialysis enhanced dopamine (DA) outflow up to 173, 283, and 584% of baseline values, respectively. The 5-HT effect was partially reduced by 1 or 10 mu M GR 125,487, a 5-HT4 antagonist, and by 100 mu M DAU 6285, a 5-HT3/4 antagonist, whereas the 5-HT1/2/6 antagonist methiothepin (50 mu M) was ineffective. In the presence of tetrodotoxin the effect of 1 mu M 5-HT was not affected by 5-HT4 antagonists. In addition, tetrodotoxin abolished the increase in DA release induced by the 5-HT4 agonist (S)-zacopride (100 mu M). In striatal synaptosomes, 1 and 10 mu M 5-HT increased the outflow of newly synthesized [H-3]DA up to 163 and 635% of control values, respectively. The 5-HT4 agonists BIMU 8 and (S)-zacopride (1 and 10 mu M) failed to modify [H-3] DA outflow, whereas 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT) at 10 mu M increased it (62%). In prelabeled [H-3]DA synaptosomes, 1 mu M 5-HT, but not (S)-zacopride (1 and 10 mu M), increased [3H]DA outflow. DAU 6285 (In mu M) failed to modify the enhancement of newly synthesized [3H]DA outflow induced by 5-MeOT or 5-HT(1 mu M), whereas the effect of 5-HT was reduced to the same extent by the DA reuptake inhibitor nomifensine(1 mu M) alone or in the presence of DAU 6285. These results show that striatal 5-HT4 receptors are involved in the 5-HT-induced enhancement of striatal DA release in vivo and that they are not located on striatal DA terminals.
