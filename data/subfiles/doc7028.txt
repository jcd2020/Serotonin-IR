Martinez-Price, D. L. and M. A. Geyer (2002). "Subthalamic 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptor modulation of RU 24969-induced behavioral profile in rats." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 71(4): 569-580.

	The effects of systemic administration of the serotonin (5-HT)(1A/1B) agonist 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)1H-indole (RU 24969) on locomotor and investigatory behavior in rats have been well characterized using the behavioral pattern monitor (BPM). To elucidate the neural circuitry underlying this behavioral profile, intracerebral dose--response studies were conducted at two sites with high densities of 5-HT(1B) receptors, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and substantia nigra. Infusion of RU 24969 into the STN produced systemic RU 24969-like changes in locomotor activity and patterns but an uncharacteristic increase in investigatory holepokes. Intra-STN administration of the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) produced RU 24969-like changes in locomotor patterns only, while the 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist 3(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrid-4-yl)pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrid-5-one dihydrochloride (CP-93,129) increased locomotor activity, produced no change in locomotor patterns and nonsignificantly increased holepokes. Intranigral infusion of RU 24969 produced systemic and intra-STN RU 24969-like increases in locomotor activity. Intranigral RU 24969, however, failed to produce any changes in locomotor patterns or investigatory holepokes. Intranigral infusions of CP-93,129 or 8-OH-DPAT had no effects on locomotor activity, locomotor patterns or investigatory holepokes. These results provide evidence for multiple-site mediation of the locomotor-activating effects of RU 24969 and for a dissociation of the neural substrates underlying locomotor and investigatory components of the RU 24969-induced behavioral profile.
