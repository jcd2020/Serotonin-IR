	The serotonergic system in the central nervous system (CNS) has complex interactions with many, if not all other neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Its localization, distribution and amazing receptor diversity makes it an appealing system for modulatory aspects in many basic behaviors, including sexual and aggressive behaviors. Notwithstanding decades of research into the putative role of the serotonin (5-HT) system in aggression and sex, no clear picture has emerged. In aggression, depending on state or trait, 5-HT is involved in either the performance or its termination. Application of drugs, and particular selective ligands for certain receptors, suggests a specific role for the (postsynaptic) 5-HT(1B) and to a lesser extent, the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the modulation of (offensive) aggression. In sexual behavior, the role of 5-HT is less well studied. Here, 5-HT(1A) receptor activation and blockade of 5-HT(2C) receptors are prosexual, whereas 5-HT(1B) receptor activation is inhibitory. Selective serotonergic uptake inhibitors have no acute effects on sexual behavior but are inhibitory after chronic administration. The role of serotonin in aggression and sexual behavior most likely involves different, partly overlapping, neurochemical systems, suggesting that independent networks in both behavioral systems are differentially influenced by serotonergic tone influencing various 5-HT receptors.
