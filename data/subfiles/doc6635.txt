Lovick, T. A. (1993). "Serotonergic influence from nucleus raphe obscurus on neurones in the periaqueductal grey matter in the rat." Brain Res 606(1): 92-98.

	In rats anaesthetised with urethane, iontophoretic application of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 5-70 nA) produced changes in ongoing activity of 41/44 neurones in the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG). The majority (85%) of responsive cells were inhibited and 15% were excited. The inhibitions were mimicked in 5/7 cells by iontophoresis of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 10-30 nA) whilst excitation was produced in 3/5 cells by iontophoresis of the 5-HT2 agonist alpha-methyl-5-HT (10-30 nA). Selective activation of neuronal perikarya in nucleus raphe obscurus (NRO) by microinjection of 50-100 nl D,L-homocysteic acid (DLH) inhibited ongoing activity of 25/31 neurones tested in the PAG for periods of 30-580 s, mean 183.5 s. The duration of the inhibition was potentiated by between 36 and 300% during iontophoresis of the 5-HT re-uptake blocker paroxetine (1-25 nA, 6/6 cells). The results indicate that there is an extensive inhibitory serotonergic input to the PAG which originates, at least in part, from NRO.
