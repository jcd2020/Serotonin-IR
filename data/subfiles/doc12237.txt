Zemlan, F. P. and E. F. Schwab (1991). "CHARACTERIZATION OF A NOVEL SEROTONIN RECEPTOR SUBTYPE (5-HT1S) IN RAT CNS - INTERACTION WITH A GTP BINDING-PROTEIN." Journal of Neurochemistry 57(6): 2092-2099.

	Three pharmacologically distinct high-affinity [H-3]serotonin ([H-3]5-HT) binding sites were identified in spinal cord synaptosomes. [H-3]5-HT competition studies using selective 5-HT1A receptor ligands indicated that approximately 25% of high-affinity synaptosomal [H-3]5-HT binding was inhibited by 5-HT1A-selective compounds, an estimate consistent with [H-3](+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT) saturation experiments in which 5-HT1A receptors were directly labeled. [H-3]5-HT competition studies using high-affinity 5-HT1B compounds performed in the presence of 100 nM 8-OH-DPAT (to block 5-HT1A receptors) indicated that approximately 26% of all specific, high-affinity [H-3]5-HT binding to spinal cord synaptosomes was to 5-HT1B receptors. [H-3]5-HT competition studies performed in the presence of 100 nM 8-OH-DPAT and 10 nM RU 24969 (to block 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, respectively) indicated that the remaining 49% of [H-3]5-HT binding did not possess the pharmacologic profile previous reported for 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2, or 5-HT3 receptors. This residual 49% of [H-3]5-HT binding to spinal cord synaptosomes observed in the presence of 100 nM 8-OH-DPAT and 10 nM RU 24969 (subsequently referred to as "5-HT1S") displayed high affinity and saturability (K(D) = 4.7 nM) in association/dissociation and saturation experiments. Addition of 300-mu-M GTP or the nonhydrolyzable form of GTP, 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, inhibited [H-3]5-HT binding to 5-HT1S receptors in saturation experiments by 35 and 57%, respectively, whereas ATP was without effect. [H-3]5-HT competition studies identified several 5-HT agonists and antagonists with a high or moderately high affinity for 5-HT1S receptors. Although 5-HT1S receptors were the predominant 5-HT1 receptor subtype present in spinal cord, no significant density of 5-HT1S receptors was found in brainstem or frontal cortex.
