	Antagonists at NK1 substance P receptors have demonstrated similar antidepressant properties in both animal paradigms and in human as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) that induce desensitization of 5-HT 1A autoreceptors within the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We investigated whether this receptor adaptation also occurs upon NK1 receptor blockade. C57B/L6J mice were treated for 21 days with the selective NK1 receptor antagonist GR 205171 (10 mg/kg daily) through subcutaneously implanted osmotic mini pumps, and DRN 5-HT 1A autoreceptor functioning was assessed using various approaches. Recording of DRN serotonergic neurons in brainstem slices showed that GR 205171 treatment reduced (by approximately 1.5 fold) the potency of the 5-HT 1A receptor agonist, ipsapirone, to inhibit cell firing. In parallel, the 5-HT 1A autoreceptor-mediated [35S]GTP-gamma-S binding induced by 5-carboxamidotryptamine onto the DRN in brainstem sections was significantly decreased in GR 205171-treated mice. In vivo microdialysis showed that the cortical 5-HT overflow caused by acute injection of the SSRI paroxetine (1 mg/kg) was twice as high in GR 205171-treated as in vehicle-treated controls. In the DRN, basal 5-HT outflow was significantly enhanced by GR 205171 treatment. These data supported the hypothesis that chronic NK1 receptor blockade induces a functional desensitization of 5-HT 1A autoreceptors similar to that observed with SSRIs.
