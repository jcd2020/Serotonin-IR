	Protein-protein interaction is often investigated using quantitative molecular microscopy with Forster resonant energy transfer (FRET). Here, we combined 'linear unmixing FRET' (lux-FRET) with the simultaneous application of a FRET-based biosensor for cAMP to investigate the oligomerization between the 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R, also known as HTR7) and the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR, also known as HTR1A) and its importance for cAMP signaling. We found that the 5-HT7R not only stimulates cAMP production, but also forms heterooligomers with 5-HT1AR, which blocks the inhibitory effect of the latter. 5-HT7R signaling, however, is not affected by this hetero-oligomerization. By modeling the kinetics of intracellular cAMP level changes in relation to the 5-HT7R:5-HT1AR stoichiometry, we were able to decipher the complex signaling characteristics of endogenous serotonin receptors in cultured hippocampal neurons. Our findings indicate that serotonergic signaling is not only modulated by the concentration of an individual receptor but also by its specific interaction with other receptors in endogenous systems. We conclude that the regulated ratio of serotonin receptors in immature and mature neurons may be critically involved in both the onset and response to treatments of psychiatric diseases, such as anxiety and depression.
