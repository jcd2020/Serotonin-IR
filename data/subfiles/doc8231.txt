Maura, G., et al. (1989). "Acetylcholine release from rat hippocampal slices is modulated by 5-hydroxytryptamine." Eur J Pharmacol 165(2-3): 173-179.

	Experiments were performed with slices of rat hippocampus in order to investigate whether the release of acetylcholine in this area is modulated through 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. The slices were prelabeled with [3H]choline then stimulated electrically twice for 4 min each at a frequency of 3 Hz. The overflow of tritium evoked was inhibited by exogenous 5-HT in a concentration-dependent manner. The 5-HT2 receptor agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HC1 ((+/-)-DOI), did not mimic 5-HT. The effect of 5-HT was antagonized by methiothepin but not by the 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin. The 5-HT1 agonist, 5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl]-1H-indole (RU 24969), inhibited the electrically evoked overflow of tritium, whereas the 5-HT1A-selective agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), was ineffective. Methiothepin itself, but not ketanserin, increased the evoked overflow of tritium. In contrast, the overflow was inhibited by the 5-HT uptake blocker, 6-nitroquipazine. The evoked overflow was also reduced by d-fenfluramine, a serotonin releaser. The concentration-inhibition curve for d-fenfluramine was shifted to the right by methiothepin. It is concluded that the release of ACh in rat hippocampus may be tonically inhibited by 5-HT through the activation of receptors, possibly belonging to the 5-HT1B subtype.
