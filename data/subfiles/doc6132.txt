Johnson, S. W., et al. (1992). "5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(1B) RECEPTORS BLOCK THE GABA(B) SYNAPTIC POTENTIAL IN RAT DOPAMINE NEURONS." Journal of Neuroscience 12(5): 2000-2006.

	Intracellular recordings were made from presumed dopamine-containing neurons in slices cut from the midbrain of the rat. Focal electrical stimulation produced a hyperpolarizing synaptic potential that was reduced by 75-95% by the GABA(B)-receptor antagonist 2-hydroxysaclofen (300-mu-M). 5-HT (3-100-mu-M) reduced the amplitude of the GABA(B) synaptic potential by 20-74%, with a 50% reduction at 10-mu-M, but did not reduce the amplitude of synaptic potentials mediated by GABA(A) receptors. 5-HT acted presynaptically because hyperpolarizations produced by exogenously administered GABA (1 mm) in picrotoxin (100-mu-M) were not affected by 5-HT (30-mu-M). (+/-)-Cyanopindolol (100 nM), a 5-HT1B antagonist, blocked the effect of 5-HT (10-mu-Mm); spiperone (1-mu-M), which is an antagonist at 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors, had no effect. The amplitude of the GABA(B) synaptic potential was reduced by the 5-HT1B receptor agonists 1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-piperazine (300 nM) and 7-trifluoromethyl 4-(4-methyl- 1 -piperazinyl)-pyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoxaline (1-mu-M), but not by the 5-HT1A agonist N,N-dipropyl-5-carboxamido-tryptamine (1-mu-M) or the 5-HT2 agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-amino-propane (10-mu-M). We conclude that 5-HT activates presynaptic 5-HT1B receptors that inhibit the release of GABA onto GABA(B) but not GABA(A) receptors.
