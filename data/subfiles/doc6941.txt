	RATIONALE: Dyskinesia affects the majority of levodopa-treated parkinsonian patients within 5-10 years of treatment with levodopa. Clinical and preclinical observations suggest that an increase in serotoninergic transmission can contribute to the appearance of dyskinesias. It is thus conceivable that a modulation of synaptic dopamine (DA) levels induced by the inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) release, as a consequence of 5-HT(1A) agonists administration, might alleviate dyskinesias. OBJECTIVE: Since 5-HT(1A) receptors are expressed in the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of the intrasubthalamic administration of sarizotan, a compound with full 5-HT(1A) agonist properties, on levodopa-induced dyskinesias in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) model of parkinsonism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received a unilateral 6-OHDA administration in the nigrostriatal pathway. A test of apomorphine was performed to evaluate dopamine depletion. One week later, a cannula was implanted in the STN. Animals were treated with levodopa (6 mg/kg, i.p., twice at day) for 22 consecutive days. On day 23, several doses (1 ng, 10 ng, or 1 microg) of sarizotan were administered through the cannula to the STN. The higher doses of sarizotan effectively attenuated all levodopa-induced dyskinesias including axial, limb, and orolingual subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the STN is a target structure for the antidyskinetic action of sarizotan and indicate that drug-mediated modulation of STN activity may be an alternative option for the treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease.
