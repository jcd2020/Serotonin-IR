	In the present study we have examined the interaction between the selective cholecystokinin (CCK)A and CCKB receptor antagonists, devazepide and L365-260 on morphine conditioned place preference (CPP). Using an unbiased procedure, morphine (1.5 mg/kg) produced a reliable CPP which was observed irrespective of the conditioning compartment type. Pretreatment with devazepide (0.001-0.01 mg/kg s.c.) produced a dose related attenuation of this response. At higher doses (0.1-1 mg/kg) this antagonism became variable and dependent on the training compartment with blockade only observed when conditioning was to the white/rough textured environment. This profile has also been reported for the serotonin (5-HT)3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. The CCKB antagonist L365-260 (0.000001-0.01 mg/kg) failed to antagonize the morphine CPP, if anything a mild potentiation was observed. To study this further we examined the interaction between L365-260 (0.01 mg/kg) and a subthreshold dose of morphine (0.3 mg/kg). At these doses neither drug elicited CPP, however when co-administered a significant CPP was recorded. Finally, L365-260 at 1 mg/kg induced a mild but significant CPP when administered alone. These results suggest a differential role of CCK receptor subtypes on reward-related behaviour and complement previous studies suggesting bimodal effects of CCK systems on mesolimbic dopamine function.
