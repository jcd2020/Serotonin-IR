	A common intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (T102C) in the 5-HT2A receptor gene is associated with the development of different neuropsychiatric symptoms, including hallucinations and depressive symptoms in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Differential 5-HT2A receptor binding has also been associated with the development of these symptoms in AD. However, the relationship between 5-HT2A (T102C) genotype and 5-HT2A receptor binding in AD and control human brains has not been examined. We examined the association between different 5-HT2A (T102C) genotypes and [(3)H] ketanserin binding in the temporal and frontal cortex of 20 AD and 14 control human brains. In homozygotes, but not heterozygotes, there was a significant reduction in B(max) values for [(3)H] ketanserin binding in both areas of cortex in AD compared with control subjects. This study suggests a mechanism for the generation of different neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD from a single nucleotide polymorphism with reduced receptor binding in T102C 5-HT2A receptor gene homozygotes correlating with susceptibility to depressive symptoms, whereas the relative preservation of receptor binding in heterozygotes with AD correlating with susceptibility to hallucinations.
