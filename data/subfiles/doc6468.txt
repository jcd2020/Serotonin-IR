Khawaja, X., et al. (1995). "CHARACTERIZATION OF THE BINDING OF H-3 WAY-100635, A NOVEL 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(1A) RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, TO RAT-BRAIN." J Neurochem 64(6): 2716-2726.

	The specific binding of [H-3]WAY-100635 {N-[2- [4-(2-[O-methyl-H-3]methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide trihydrochloride} to rat hippocampal membrane preparations was time, temperature, and tissue concentration dependent. The rates of [H-3]WAY-100635 association (k(+1) = 0.069 +/- 0.015 nM(-1) min(-1)) and dissociation (k(-1) = 0.023 +/- 0.001 min(-1)) followed monoexponential kinetics, Saturation binding isotherms of [H-3]WAY-100635 exhibited a single class of recognition site with an affinity of 0.37 +/- 0.051 nM and a maximal binding capacity (B-max) of 312 +/- 12 fmol/mg of protein, The maximal number of binding sites labelled by [H-3]WAY-100635 was similar to 36% higher compared with that of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-[H-3]-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT). The binding affinity of [3H]WAY-100635 was significantly lowered by the divalent cations CaCl2 (2.5-fold; p < 0.02) and MnCl2 (3.6-fold; p < 0.05), with no effect on B-max. Guanyl nucleotides failed to influence the K-D and B-max parameters of [H-3]WAY-100635 binding to 5-HT1A receptors, The pharmacological binding profile of [H-3]WAY-100635 was closely correlated with that of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, which is consistent with the labelling of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5HT(1A)) sites in rat hippocampus. [H-3]WAY-100635 competition curves with 5-HT1A agonists and partial agonists were best resolved into high- and low-affinity binding components, whereas antagonists were best described by a one-site binding model. In the presence of 50 mu M guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S), competition curves for the antagonists remained unaltered, whereas the agonist and partial agonist curves were shifted to the right, reflecting an influence of G protein coupling on agonist versus antagonist binding to the 5-HT1A receptor, However, a residual (16 +/- 2%) high-affinity agonist binding component was still apparent in the presence of GTP gamma S, indicating the existence of GTP-insensitive sites.
