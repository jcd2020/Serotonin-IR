Zubkov, E. A., et al. (2009). "Chronic actions of thyroxine on behavior and serotonin receptors in mouse strains with contrasting predispositions to catalepsy." Neurosci Behav Physiol 39(9): 909-914.

	The studies reported here addressed the effects of chronic administration of thyroxine (2 mg/liter for 60 days) on catalepsy and the functional activity and expression of the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptor genes in the brains of adult male mice of the cataleptic ASC strain and the catalepsy-resistant AKR strain. Thyroxine induced cataleptics in AKR mice but had anticataleptic activity in ASC animals. Chronic thyroxine administration increased the functional activity and expression of 5-HT(2A) receptors in the frontal cortex in AKR mice but not in ASC mice. In ASC mice, the hormone significantly weakened the hypothermic effect of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, though it did not alter the expression of these receptors. These results suggest that 5-HT(2A) receptors are involved in the cataleptogenic while 5-HT(1A) receptors are involved in the anticataleptic effects of the hormone in mice.
