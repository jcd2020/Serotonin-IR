Ferry, R. C., et al. (1994). "Regulation of mRNA encoding 5-HT2A receptors in P11 cells through a post-transcriptional mechanism requiring activation of protein kinase C." J Biol Chem 269(50): 31850-31857.

	Exposure of P11 cells to serotonin (5-HT) resulted in a transient increase in levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA. Exposure to 5-HT for as short a time as 1 min was sufficient to trigger a delayed increase in receptor mRNA. 5-HT-induced increases in receptor mRNA levels were not antagonized by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. The increase in receptor mRNA levels was accompanied by a transient increase in the half-life of receptor mRNA; the rate of transcription of receptor mRNA was unchanged. Submaximal stimulation of phosphinositide hydrolysis by partial agonists or 6-fluoronorepinephrine, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist, also increased receptor mRNA levels. Exposure to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an activator of protein kinase C, mimicked these effects, whereas the protein kinase C inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide antagonized the effects of both 5-HT and PMA. When agonist-promoted increases in receptor mRNA were prevented, the rate of agonist-induced down-regulation was accelerated. These data suggest that levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA are regulated by phospholipase C-coupled receptors via a protein kinase C-dependent, post-transcriptional mechanism and indicate that agonist-promoted increases in levels of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA modulate receptor expression.
