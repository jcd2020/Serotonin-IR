	The WAG/RIJ rats exhibit spontaneously occurring spike-wave discharges (SWD) accompanied by behavioural phenomena, with characteristics similar to the human absence type epilepsy. To study the mechanisms involved in this type of epileptiform activity we investigated the effects of the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenno [a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801). Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of 8-OH-DPAT caused marked, dose dependent increase, MK-801 a decrease in the cumulative duration and number of spike-wave discharges. Pretreatment with MK-801 (10 mu g/rat i.c.v.) abolished the increase caused by 8-OH-DPAT (20 mu g/rat i.c.v.), but the decrease in SWD to MK-801 was counterbalanced by 8-OH-DPAT. These data provide evidence for an interaction of glutamatergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the triggering and maintenance of epileptic activity in this genetic model of absence epilepsy.
