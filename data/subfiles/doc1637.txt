	Schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which impaired decision-making and goal-directed behaviors are core features. One of the genes associated with schizophrenia is the Close Homolog of L1 (CHL1); CHL1-deficient mice are considered a model of schizophrenia-like deficits, including sensorimotor gating, interval timing and spatial memory impairments. Here we investigated temporal discounting in CHL1-deficient (KO) mice and their wild-type littermates. Although no discounting differences were found under baseline conditions, CHL1-KO mice showed increased impulsive choice following chronic unpredictable stress (fewer % larger-later choices, and reduced area under the discounting curve). Stressed CHL1-KO mice also showed decreased neuronal activation (number of cFos positive neurons) in the discounting task in the prelimbic cortex and dorsal striatum, areas thought to be part of executive and temporal processing circuits. Impulsive choice alterations were reversed by the 5-HT2C agonist Ro 60-0175. Our results provide evidence for a gene x environment, double-hit model of stress-related decision-making impairments, and identify CHL1-deficient mice as a mouse model for these deficits in regard to schizophrenia-like phenotypes.
