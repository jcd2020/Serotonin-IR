	The effects of acute and repeated administration of antidepressive drugs on apomorphine-induced aggressive behavior and [3H]citalopram binding were studied. In acute behavioral experiments with apomorphine pretreated (1.0 mg/kg, once daily) animals, desipramine (10 mg/kg) and clomipramine (10 mg/kg) enhanced, buspirone (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg) completely blocked, but fluoxetine, amitriptyline, imipramine (10 mg/kg), and citalopram (10 and 20 mg/kg) had no effect on the intensity of aggressive behavior. Repeated concomitant apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg) and citalopram (10 mg/kg) administration reduced the affinity (Kd) of the 5-HT transporter binding sites in three brain regions. This finding was confirmed by an additional experiment as the effect of citalopram treatment. Repeated apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg) or apomorphine (1.0 mg/kg) plus desipramine (10 mg/kg) treatment had no unidirectional effect on Kd, the maximal number of apparent binding sties (Bmax) was unchanged in all experiments. Our study indicates that the 5-HT reuptake blockade has no major influence on the apomorphine-induced aggressive behavior, but the 5-HT1A receptor subtype may be involved in the mediation of the aggressive behavior in this paradigm.
