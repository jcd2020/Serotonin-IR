	Prenatal 5HT depletion causes a significant decrease in the level of nociceptive sensitivity during the second phase of the formalin test behavioral response. These experiments were designed to test whether blocking 5HT2A/2c receptors in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus would decrease nociceptive behaviors induced by a peripheral noxious stimulus formalin as an animal model of unremitting human being. The 5HT2A/2c receptor antagonist ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl) was injected into the CA1 area and dentate gyrus of behaving rats 5 min before subcutaneous injection of formalin irritant. Nociceptive behaviors in both phases of the formalin test were significantly decreased by ritanserin (4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl) and ritanserin had no effect at 2 microg/0.5 microl. These results support the hypothesis that the hippocampal formation may modify the processing of incoming nociceptive information and that 5HT2A/2c receptor-sensitive mechanisms in the hippocampus may play a role in nociception and/or the expression of related behaviors.
