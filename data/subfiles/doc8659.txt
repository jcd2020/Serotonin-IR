"DIFFERENTIAL FUNCTIONAL-ACTIVITY OF 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RECEPTOR LIGANDS AND BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS AT 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(1B) RECEPTOR-SITES IN CHINESE-HAMSTER LUNG FIBROBLASTS AND OPOSSUM RENAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 270(3): 938-945.

	Functional activity of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor ligands and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists was studied at 5-HT1B receptor sites in Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts by measuring two cellular responses: inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP formation and potentiation of basic fibroblast growth (BFGF) induced mitogenesis. A good correlation was found between the potency of agonists to inhibit forskolin-induced cyclic AMP formation and their potency to potentiate bFGF-induced thymidine incorporation in CHL fibroblasts. Potent agonist activity was measured with 5-methoxy-3,1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyidinyl-1H-indole (RU 24,969), 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), 3-(1,2,5,6)-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl-5-pyrrolo(3,2-b)pyril-5-one (CP 93,129) and 5-HT, whereas sumatriptan displayed weak agonist activity at concentrations different from its binding affinity for 5-HT1B binding sites. In contrast to the observed 5-HT1B receptor-mediated agonist activity in opossum kidney cells for metergoline and the beta adrenergic receptor antagonists: cyanopindolol, 4-(3-tert-butyl-amino-2-hydroxypropoxy)-indole-2 carbonic acid isopropyl ester (SDZ 21,009), isamoltane, (-)-propranolol and (-)-pindolol, antagonist activity at 5-HT1B receptor sites was yielded in CHL fibroblasts in accordance with the reported observations at rat brain 5-HT1B receptors. Methiothepin was the only compound that antagonized both the opossum kidney cell and CHL fibroblast 5-HT1B receptor-mediated responses although the antagonist effect was more pronounced in CHL fibroblasts. In conclusion, both 5-HT1B receptor cell systems allow to measure different degrees of agonist or antagonist potencies of compounds and are particularly useful to define agonist, partial agonist or antagonist activity of compounds with affinity for 5-HT1B receptors.
