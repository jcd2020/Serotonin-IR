Boulenguez, P., et al. (1991). "Pharmacological characterization of serotonin-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl-tyrosinamide, a new selective indolic ligand for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B and 5-HT1D binding sites." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 259(3): 1360-1365.

	The affinity of a new serotonin (S) derivative, serotonin-O-carboxymethyl-glycyl-tyrosinamide (S-CM-GTNH2), for the various 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1 receptor subtypes was tested using quantitative autoradiography on rat and guinea pig brain sections. In the rat, S-CM-GTNH2 is 57 and 24 times more potent at 5-HT1B sites (IC50 = 28 nM) than at 5-HT1A (IC50 = 1600 nM) and 5-HT1C sites (IC50 = 670 nM), respectively. In the guinea pig, the affinity of S-CM-GTNH2 for 5-HT1D sites (IC50 = 67 nM) is 21 times higher than at 5-HT1A sites (IC50 = 1400 nM). S-CM-GTNH2 shows a low affinity (less than 10 microM) for 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 binding sites. This new ligand is therefore highly specific for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D binding sites and can be used to further characterize the involvement of these subtypes in physiological studies focusing particularly on behavioral effects.
