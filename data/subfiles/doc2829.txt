	The pharmacokinetic properties of radiotracers are crucial for successful in vivo single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging. Our goal was to determine if MDR1A-deficient animals could allow better SPECT imaging outcomes than wild-type (WT) animals for a selection of serotoninergic radioligands. Thus, we compared the performances of I-123-p-MPPI, I-123-R91150, I-123-SB207710, and I-123-ADAM radioligands, for imaging of their respective targets (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT](1A), 5-HT2A, 5-HT4 ,and serotonin transporter [SERT]), in WT and Mdr1a knockout (KO) rats. With I-123-SB207710, virtually no SPECT signal was recorded in the brain of WT or KO animals. For I-123-p-MPPI, low nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND, mean +/- SD) were observed in WT (0.49 +/- 0.25) and KO (0.89 +/- 0.52) animals. For I-123-ADAM, modest imaging contrast was observed in WT (1.27 +/- 0.02) and KO (1.31 +/- 0.09) animals. For I-123-R91150, the BPND were significantly higher in Mdr1a KO (3.98 +/- 0.65) animals compared to WT animals (1.22 +/- 0.26). The pharmacokinetics of I-123-SB207710 and I-123-p-MPPI do not make them ideal tracers for preclinical SPECT neuroimaging. I-123-ADAM showed adequate brain uptake regardless of Mdr1a expression and appeared suitable for preclinical SPECT neuroimaging in both animal strains. The use of Mdr1a KO animals significantly improved the brain penetration of I-123-R91150, making this animal strain an interesting option when considering SPECT neuroimaging of 5-HT2A receptors in rat.
