	It is known that serotonin is widely distributed in the body; its receptors are located in various tissues and organs. It has been reported that serotonin receptors without apparent synaptic structure exist in the peripheral nervous system. These serotonin receptors might be the target of circulatory serotonin. In particular, serotonin has a potent depolarizing action on vagal afferent nerves. This stimulation causes various autonomic reflexes, so-called von Bezold-Jarisch reflex, that consist of bradycardia, hypotension and apnea. The peripheral 5-HT3-receptor subtype seems to be responsible for the initiation of these reflexes. The physiological and pathophysiological significance of these serotonin-induced modulations have not, however, been established. The present study was designed to examine the effects of exogenous serotonin on the chemosensitive afferent nerves including carotid sinus nerves, cervical vagus nerve, and efferent motor nerves, such as phrenic nerves and pharyngeal nerves. Because little is known about the involvement of the serotonergic system in the pulmonary reflex and pulmonary-related reflexes (swallowing or vomiting), the distribution of the motor component of these nerves within the brain stem of the rat was also determined.
