	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiologic roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). 5-HT is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are five receptor subtypes within the G protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F. 5-HT1A receptors are abundantly present in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, raphe nucleus, and septum, and the lowest densities are observed in the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and cerebellum (5). Some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei have intermediate densities. 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the mediation of emotion and the function of the hypothalamus. 5-HT1A receptors are implicated in anxiety, depression, hallucinogenic behavior, motion sickness, and eating disorders (6). Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacologic role of 5-HT1A receptors. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT1A radioligands [PubMed] for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, such as [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY 100635, [(18)F]FPWAY, and [(18)F]MPPF. However, some of these compounds lack resistance to in vivo metabolism (7), which may cause difficulties in using the reference region method for determination of 5-HT1A receptor densities in the brain. (R)-2,3,4,5,6,7-Hexahydro-1-[4-[1-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]]-2-phenylbutyr yl]-1H-azepine (RWAY) is structurally similar to WAY100635 with the direction of its amide group reversed, which might be less susceptible to amide hydrolysis in vivo. RWAY was reported to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 0.6 nM) (8). This led to the development of (R)-2,3,4,5,6,7-Hexahydro-1-[4-[1-[4-(2-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]]-2-phen ylbutyryl]-1H-azepine ([(11)C]RWAY) as a useful tool for in vivo PET imaging of the 5-HT1A receptor. However, a relatively slow washout of radioactivity from the human brain likely reflects the accumulation of radiometabolite(s) in human brain (9). Therefore, the use of [(11)C]RWAY has been discontinued in humans.
