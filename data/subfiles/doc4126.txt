Garcia, R., et al. (2006). "Synthesis and biological evaluation of tricarbonyl Re(I) and Tc(I) complexes anchored by poly(azolyl)borates: application on the design of radiopharmaceuticals for the targeting of 5-HT1A receptors." Journal of Biological Inorganic Chemistry 11(6): 769-782.

	The building blocks fac-[Tc-99m{kappa(3)-HB (tim(Me))(3)}(CO)(3)] and fac-[Tc-99m{kappa(3)-R(mu-H)B(tim(Me))(2)} (CO)(3)] [R is H (4a), Ph (5a); tim(Me) is 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazolyl] were obtained almost quantitatively by reacting fac-[Tc-99m(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+) with the corresponding scorpionate. These compounds cross the intact blood-brain barrier in mice, with significant retention in the case of 4a and 5a. Using 4a as the lead structure, we have synthesized the functionalized complexes fac[M{kappa(3) -H(mu-H)B(tim(Bu-pip))(2)}(CO)(3)] [M is Re (8), Tc-99m (8a); tim(Bu-pip) is methyl[4-((2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piper-azinyl)butyl](2-mercapto-1-methylimidazol-5-yl)methan amide] and fac-[M{kappa(3)-H(mu-H)B(tim(Me))(tim(Bu-pip))} (CO)(3)] [M is Re (9), Tc-99m (9a)] and evaluated their potential as radioactive probes for the targeting of brain 5-HT1A serotonergic receptors. The Re complexes exhibit excellent affinity [IC50=0.172 +/- 0.003 nM (8); IC50=0.65 +/- 0.01 nM (9)] for the 5-HT1A receptor. The radioactive congeners (Tc-99m) have shown an initial brain uptake of 1.38 +/- 0.46%ID g(-1) (8a) and 0.43 +/- 0.12%ID g(-1) (9a), but suffer from a relatively fast washout.
