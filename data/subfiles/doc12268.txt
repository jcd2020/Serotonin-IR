	An aspartate residue (Asp-72) in the transmembrane helix 11 of mouse 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 receptor (5-HT6) is conserved among most G protein-coupled receptors. We have examined the functional significance of this residue by site-directed mutagenesis. A single Asp -> Ala (D72A) mutation resulted in an 8-fold decrease in apparent affinity for 5-HT, and a 60-fold reduction in EC50 value of agonist-induced stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. A F69L/T70I/D72A triple mutant showed a 2-fold reduction in apparent affinity for 5-HT but complete loss of adenylyl cyclase stimulation. Binding of SB-258585 (4-iodo-N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)phenyl]benzene-sulfonamide), a selective 5-HT6 antagonist, was mildly affected (2- to 4-fold decrease in affinity) in the two mutants. Our data suggest that Asp-72 and additional residues toward the intracellular side of TM 11 have a limited role in ligand binding but are critical for functional activation of the 5-HT6 receptor.
