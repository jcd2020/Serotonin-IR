Maura, G., et al. (1991). "5-HT2 presynaptic receptors mediate inhibition of glutamate release from cerebellar mossy fibre terminals." Eur J Pharmacol 202(2): 185-190.

	'Giant' synaptosomes originating from mossy fibre terminals and having sedimentation properties different from those of standard synaptosomes were obtained from rat cerebellum. Exposure of superfused giant synaptosomes to 15 mM KCl caused the release of endogenous glutamate in a largely (about 80%) calcium-dependent manner. The K(+)-evoked overflow of glutamate was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and by the 5-HT2 receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI), but not by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). The effects of 5-HT and DOI were quite potent, already reaching significant inhibition (about 25%) at 10 nM. The 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin counteracted the inhibitory effect of 5-HT. In cerebellar slices, ketanserin increased on its own the calcium-dependent K(+)-evoked release of glutamate and this effect was not prevented by tetrodotoxin (TTX). The results support the idea that cerebellar mossy fibres use glutamate as a transmitter and show that the release of glutamate can be inhibited via presynaptic heteroreceptors of the 5-HT2 type probably localized on the mossy fibre terminals.
