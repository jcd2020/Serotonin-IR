Gresch, P. J. and P. D. Walker (1999). "Acute p-chloroamphetamine increases striatal preprotachykinin mRNA: role of the serotonin 2A/2C receptor." Brain Res Mol Brain Res 67(1): 190-193.

	Acute administration of p-chloroamphetamine (pCA) significantly increased (+90%) preprotachykinin (PPT) mRNA levels in the rat striatum. Administration of the serotonin2A/2C receptor antagonist, ritanserin, blocked the pCA-induced increase in PPT mRNA levels. alpha-Methyl-p-tyrosine pretreatment (alpha-MT, to reduce dopamine transmission) inhibited the pCA-induced increase in PPT mRNA levels. These results indicate that the pCA-induced increase in striatal PPT mRNA expression is mediated by serotonin2A/2C receptors but also requires dopamine tone.
