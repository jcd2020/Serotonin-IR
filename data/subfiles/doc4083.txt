Galligan, J. J. (1992). "DIFFERENTIAL INHIBITION OF CHOLINERGIC AND NONCHOLINERGIC NEUROGENIC CONTRACTIONS BY 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(1A) RECEPTOR AGONISTS IN GUINEA-PIG ILEUM." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 260(1): 306-312.

	Previous studies have shown that 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors are localized only to a subset of myenteric neurons in guinea pig ileum; the purpose of this study was to determine the possible functional significance of this differential receptor localization. Nerve-mediated contractions of the longitudinal muscle, myenteric plexus of guinea pig ileum were studied in vitro. Contractions were evoked by single transmural electrical stimuli (0.5-msec duration, at 0.1 Hz; cholinergic) or trains of stimuli (10 or 20 Hz for 1 sec; noncholinergic; scopolamine, 1 mu-M present). The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(n-dipropylamino)tetralin (DPAT), reduced cholinergic contractions by no more than 14% in the concentration range of 0.001 to 0.3-mu-M. At high concentrations (1 to 100-mu-M), DPAT inhibited longitudinal muscle, myenteric plexus contractions; the EC50 was 6-mu-M. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) reduced longitudinal muscle, myenteric plexus contractions by a maximum of 35% and 24% at 100 and 30-mu-M, respectively. Spiperone and 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimidobutyl]piperazine (NAN-190), two 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, did not block DPAT-induced inhibition of cholinergic contractions. DPAT (3, 10 and 30-mu-M) shifted histamine concentration-response curves to the right in an apparently competitive manner; Schild analysis yielded a pA2 of 5.2. DPAT (3, 10, 30 and 100-mu-M) also shifted bethanechol concentration-response curves to the right in an apparently competitive manner; Schild analysis yielded a pA2 of 5.5. These data indicate that DPAT blocks histamine and muscarinic receptors on longitudinal muscle. 5-CT, DPAT and 5-HT produced concentration-dependent decreases in the amplitude of noncholinergic contractions evoked by 10-Hz stimulation. EC50 values for inhibition of noncholinergic contractions by 5-CT, DPAT and 5-HT were 1.2, 32 and 251 nM, respectively. Substance P (a mediator of noncholinergic contractions) responses were unaffected by 5-HT, DPAT or 5-CT. Spiperone and NAN-190 produced rightward shifts in 5-CT concentration-response curves. Schild analysis of these data yielded a pA2 for NAN-190 of 7.7 and 7.3 for spiperone. These results show that the prejunctional actions of 5-CT, DPAT and 5-HT on cholinergic and noncholinergic contractions are quantitatively different. This could be due to differential localization of 5-HT1A receptors on cholinergic and noncholinergic motorneurons in guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus. Alternatively, prejunctional mechanisms for inhibition of acetylcholine and substance P release from the same neurons could be pharmacologically different.
