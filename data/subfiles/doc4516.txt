	Evidence that serotonin3 (5-hydroxytryptamine3, 5-HT3) antagonists attenuate behavioral responses to D-amphetamine and cocaine suggests that 5-HT3 receptors modulate brain dopamine in animals. This study examined the potential interactions of the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron and D-amphetamine in 10 healthy human volunteers. After the subjects were pretreated with placebo or ondansetron (0.15 mg/kg, i.v.), 5-h challenge tests with oral D-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg) were performed. As animal studies and early clinical studies with ondansetron have suggested nonlinear dose-response relationships, three subjects also underwent pilot studies with three doses of ondansetron (0.15, 0.05, and 0.015 mg/kg) before they received D-amphetamine. Administration of D-amphetamine increased plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, growth hormone; elevated blood pressure, pulse, and temperature; and tended to increase self-ratings of activation/euphoria and anxiety. Amphetamine-induced increases in plasma prolactin were significantly reduced by ondansetron pretreatment, but the other neuroendocrine responses were unchanged. Diastolic blood pressure elevations were also significantly attenuated after administration of the lower ondansetron doses, but the other physiologic responses were unchanged. In subjects with minimal or moderate activation/euphoria responses, ondansetron pretreatment only minimally affected these effects of D-amphetamine. Preliminary data, however, indicate that those subjects with robust activation-euphoria responses to D-amphetamine had attenuated responses after ondansetron pretreatment. Taken together, these results suggest that some but not most of D-amphetamine's biological and behavioral effects may be modified by a 5-HT3 antagonist in healthy human volunteers.
