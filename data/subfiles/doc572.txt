Balasse, L., et al. (2015). "PIXSIC, a Pixelated beta(+)-Sensitive Probe for Radiopharmacological Investigations in Rat Brain: Binding Studies with F-18 MPPF." Molecular Imaging and Biology 17(2): 163-167.

	The aim of this work was to demonstrate the pharmacokinetic potential of a wireless pixelated beta(+)-sensitive probe (PIXSIC). The binding of 2'-methoxyphenyl-(N-2'-pyridinyl)-p-[F-18]fluoro-benzamidoethylpiperazine ([F-18]MPPF), a 5-HT1A serotonin receptor radiopharmaceutical, was measured in anesthetized rats and compared to microPET data. The effects of a 5-HT1A antagonist injection on in vivo [F-18]MPPF binding were monitored by PIXSIC. PIXSIC allowed differentiating the radioactive kinetics according to the location of its pixels in the hippocampus, cortex, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. The device accurately detected the changes in [F-18]MPPF binding, after 5-HT1A antagonist blockade. The time-activity curves were reproducible and consistent with kinetics obtained simultaneously with a microPET camera. These results demonstrate the ability of the PIXSIC device to record reliably the binding of PET ligands, with a high spatiotemporal resolution in anesthetized rodents. These first in vivo results are a key stage on the path to its implementation in awake freely moving animals.
