Melo, L. L. and M. L. Brandao (1995). "INVOLVEMENT OF 5-HT1A AND 5-HT2 RECEPTORS OF THE INFERIOR COLLICULUS IN AVERSIVE STATES INDUCED BY EXPOSURE OF RATS TO THE ELEVATED PLUS-MAZE TEST." Behavioural Pharmacology 6(4): 413-417.

	Much evidence has shown that the inferior colliculus may be part of a brain system commanding defensive behavior. In the present work, evidence is presented for the serotonergic modulation of the neural substrate of aversive states elaborated in this structure. Rats implanted with a cannula in the inferior colliculus were tested on the elevated plus-maze. Microinjection of zimeldine, a 5-HT uptake blocker, produced increases in the percentage of open arm entries and time spent on the open arms. 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A agonist, and alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine, a highly selective 5-HT2 agonist, injected directly into the inferior colliculus also produced clear anxiolytic-like effects in a dose-dependent manner. Based on these results we suggest that pharmacological interference with 5-HT mechanisms in the inferior colliculus may produce antiaversive effects.
