	8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A agonist, produced a hypothermic response in mice at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg. Administration of corticosterone-21-acetate (0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg, daily for 3 and 10 days) produced a dose-dependent attenuation of this hypothermic response in mice. When all controls and corticosterone treated mice were retested, 14 days after initial testing, they did not differ in the hypothermic responses induced by 8-OH-DPAT. Mice treated with aldosterone (50 mg/kg), dexamethasone (50 mg/kg) and the specific type 2 corticosteroid receptor agonist, 11b,17b-dihydroxy-21-methyl-17a-pregna-1,4,6-trien-20-yn+ ++-3-one (RU26988, 30 mg/kg) for 10 days, did not differ from vehicle treated controls in the hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT. Mice administered corticosterone-21-acetate (30 mg/kg, daily) for 10 days displayed a motor behavioural syndrome, which was not seen in controls, when injected with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, 100 mg/kg) 15 min after the injection of carbidopa (25 mg/kg). This was significantly decreased by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-(4-phthalimidobutyl)-piperazine (NAN-190 5 mg/kg, 30 min prior to administration of carbidopa). Taken together, this evidence is compatible with a specific corticosterone induced facilitation of 5-HT release due to attenuation of inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptor function.
