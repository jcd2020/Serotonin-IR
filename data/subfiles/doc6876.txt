Kulikov, A. V. and E. A. Zubkov (2007). "Chronic thyroxine treatment activates the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor in the mouse brain." Neurosci Lett 416(3): 307-309.

	Chronic thyroxine administration (2.0 mg/l, 60 days) significantly increases the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor gene mRNA level in the frontal cortex and augments the frequency of head twitches induced by the receptor agonist DOI (1.0 mg/kg, i.p.) in AKR mice. The result indicates thyroid hormones involvement in 5-HT2A receptor regulation in adult brain.
