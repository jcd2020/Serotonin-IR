	RATIONALE: Diverse preclinical studies suggest the potential therapeutic utility of the modulation of the glutamatergic system in brain via metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors. Lu AF21934, a positive allosteric modulator of the mGlu4 receptor, was previously shown to reverse behavioral phenotypes in animal models thought to mimic positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: To begin elucidating the brain circuitry involved in mGlu4 receptor pharmacology and add mechanistic support to Lu AF21934-induced phenotypic responses, the potential involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in these antipsychotic-like effects was explored. The tests used were the following: MK-801-induced hyperactivity and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI)-induced head twitches in mice, for positive symptoms; MK-801-induced disruptions of social interactions for negative symptoms; and novel object recognition and spatial delayed alteration test for cognitive symptoms. The microdialysis studies in which the effect of Lu AF21934 on MK-801-induced dopamine and serotonin release was investigated. RESULTS: The effects caused by Lu AF2193 were inhibited by administration of the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg). That inhibition was observed across all models used. Moreover, the concomitant administration of sub-effective doses of Lu AF21934 and a sub-effective dose of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist tool compound (R)-(+)-8-hydroxy-DPAT hydrobromide (0.01 mg/kg) induced a clear antipsychotic-like effect in all the procedures used. Lu AF21934 (5 mg/kg) also inhibited MK-801-induced increase in dopamine and 5-HT release. CONCLUSIONS: The actions of Lu AF21934 are 5-HT1A receptor-dependent. Activation of the mGlu4 receptor may be a promising mechanism for the development of novel antipsychotic drugs, efficacious toward positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms.
