Zhuang, Z. P., et al. (1994). "DERIVATIVES OF 4-(2'-METHOXYPHENYL)-1- 2'-(N-2''-PYRIDINYL-P-IODOBENZAMIDO)ETHYL PIPERA ZINE (P-MPPI) AS 5-HT1A LIGANDS." J Med Chem 37(26): 4572-4575.

	A series of new p-alkylbenzamido derivatives of 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2''-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido)ethyl]piperazines (p-MPPI) were prepared. In vitro binding studies suggest that p-methyl and p-ethyl substituents on the benzamido group display the same high binding affinity to 5-HT1A receptors (K-i = 2.2 and 9.3 nM, rat hippocampal homogenates). However, when the substitution groups were larger than a C-5 pentyl group, the affinity to 5-HT1A receptors dropped below a useful level (K-i > 50 nM). Several irreversible binding agents (CH2Cl, NHCOCH2Cl) and a photoaffinity, labeling compound (m-iodo p-azido) which showed good binding affinity to 6-HT1A receptors were successfully prepared.
