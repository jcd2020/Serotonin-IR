	1 4-Amino-N-(2,4 bis-methylamino-pyrimidin-4-yl) benzene sulphonamide (Ro 04-6790) is a potent, selective and competitive antagonist for the 5-HT6 receptor which can be detected in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of rats following intraperitoneal administration. Since 5-HT6 receptor mRNA and 5-HT6 receptor-like immunoreactivity have been shown to be present in the striatum, the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of 5-HT6 receptor antagonism on haloperidol- and SCH 23390-induced catalepsy in mice and on the turning behaviour of rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. 2 Ro 04-6790 (3, 10 and 30 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not induce catalepsy and had no effect on catalepsy induced by either haloperidol or SCH 23390. 3 Ro 04-6790 (3, 10 and 30 mg kg(-1) i.p.) did not itself induce rotational behaviour in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of the medial forebrain bundle nor did it affect the rotational behaviour induced by either L-Dopa or amphetamine. 4 5-HT6 receptor antagonism inhibited the rotational behaviour of 6-OHDA lesioned rats induced by treatment with the muscarinic antagonists scopolamine and atropine. 5 The data support earlier conclusions from experiments with antisense oligonucleotides that the 5-HT6 receptor is involved in the control of acetylcholine neurotransmission in the rat brain.
