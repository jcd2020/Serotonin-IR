Di Pasquale, E., et al. (1997). "Serotonergic inhibition of phrenic motoneuron activity: an in vitro study in neonatal rat." Neurosci Lett 230(1): 29-32.

	In vitro experiments were conducted on neonatal rat brainstem-spinal cord preparations to test the hypothesis of an inhibitory modulation of phrenic activity by serotonin (5-HT) via non-5-HT2A receptors [Lindsay, A.D. and Feldman, J.L., Modulation of respiratory activity of neonatal rat phrenic motoneurones by serotonin, J. Physiol., 461 (1993) 213-233]. The changes induced by 5-HT and related agents on phrenic root discharges and membrane currents in identified phrenic motoneurons were analysed after blockade of spinal 5-HT2A receptors. Spinal application of 5-HT1B (but not 5-HT1A) receptor agonists depressed the phrenic activity and the effect was prevented by pretreatment with 5-HT1B (but not 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3) receptor antagonists. Results from phrenic motoneuron whole cell recordings do not reject a presynaptic location of the 5-HT receptors responsible for this depression.
