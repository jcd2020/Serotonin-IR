Hamon, M., et al. (1984). "Biochemical evidence for the 5-HT agonist properties of PAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) in the rat brain." Eur J Pharmacol 100(3-4): 263-276.

	In vitro investigations revealed that PAT (8-hydroxy-2-(n-dipropylamino)tetralin) interacted with postsynaptic 5-HT receptors in the rat brain: the drug stimulated 5-HT-sensitive adenylate cyclase in homogenates of colliculi from new-born rats (KAapp 8.6 microM) and inhibited the specific binding of [3H]5-HT to 5-HT1 sites. The PAT-induced inhibition of [3H]5-HT binding showed marked regional differences compatible with a preferential interaction of PAT (IC50 2 nM) with the 5-HT1A subclass. As previously seen with 5-HT agonists, the efficacy of PAT for displacing [3H]5-HT bound to hippocampal membranes was markedly increased by Mn2+ (1 mM) and reduced by GTP (0.1 mM). PAT also affected presynaptic 5-HT metabolism since it inhibited competitively (Ki 1.4 microM) [3H]5-HT uptake into cortical synaptosomes and reduced (in the presence of the 5-HT uptake inhibitor fluoxetine) the K+-evoked release of [3H]5-HT previously taken up or newly synthesized from [3H]tryptophan in cortical or striatal slices. This latter effect was prevented by 5-HT antagonists (methiothepin, metergoline) suggesting that it was mediated by the stimulation of presynaptic 5-HT autoreceptors by PAT. Like 5-HT, PAT counteracted the stimulatory effect of K+-induced depolarization on the synthesis of [3H]5-HT from [3H]tryptophan in cortical slices. It is concluded that PAT is a potent 5-HT agonist acting on both post- and presynaptic 5-HT receptors in the rat brain.
