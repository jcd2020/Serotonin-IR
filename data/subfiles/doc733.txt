Bardin, L., et al. (1997). "Differential influence of two serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists on spinal serotonin-induced analgesia in rats." Brain Res 765(2): 267-272.

	We tested the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal (i.t.) administration of 5-HT3 and the 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (mCPBG), in rats submitted to a mechanical noxious stimulus and the influence of the 5-HT3 receptor selective antagonists, tropisetron and granisetron. Both 5-HT and mCPBG (0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 20 micrograms/rat) produced a significant dose-dependent antinociception. The lowest active doses were 0.1 and 1 microgram for 5-HT and mCPBG, respectively. The effect, observed with 20 micrograms, was significantly lower with mCPBG (+33 +/- 6%) than with 5-HT (+63 +/- 7%). For 5-HT-induced antinociception, the minimal inhibitory doses were 0.001 micrograms/rat for tropisetron and 10 micrograms/rat for granisetron. In contrast, the same doses of the two antagonists (from 0.1 microgram/rat) similarly inhibited the effect of mCPBG. This study provides evidence that contrary to tropisetron, doses of granisetron able to inhibit the effect of a 5-HT3 receptor agonist failed to reduce that of 5-HT. This demonstrates a heterogeneity between 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and questions the true involvement of these receptors in spinal 5-HT-induced antinociception.
