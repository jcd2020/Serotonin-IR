Abou-Gharbia, M., et al. (1988). "Polycyclic aryl- and heteroarylpiperazinyl imides as 5-HT1A receptor ligands and potential anxiolytic agents: synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies." J Med Chem 31(7): 1382-1392.

	A series of polycyclic aryl- and heteroarylpiperazinyl imides were prepared and tested in various receptor-binding and behavioral tests. Parameters measured included in vitro inhibition of D2 and 5-HT1A receptor binding, inhibition of apomorphine (APO) induced stereotyped and climbing behavior, and activity in blocking conditioned avoidance responding (CAR). Several compounds demonstrated moderate to high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor binding site; compounds 27 and 36 containing the serotonin mimetic (o-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl moiety and compounds 42 and 50 containing the 2-pyrimidinylpiperazinyl moiety displayed the highest affinity, being equal to that of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (Ki = 1-1.3 nM). In addition to affinity at 5-HT1A binding sites, many compounds were active in blocking CAR. Compound 34, 2-[4-[4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl]hexahydro-4,7-etheno-1H- cyclobut[f]isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione, demonstrated 3 times the activity of buspirone, blocking CAR in rats with an AB50 of 13 mg/kg. It also displayed high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki = 16 nM), which is at least 20 times higher than its affinity for D2 (Ki = 345 nM) and 5-HT2 (Ki = 458 nM) receptors. Compound 34 was selected for further preclinical and pharmacokinetic evaluations for possible development as an anxiolytic agent. Structure-activity relationships within this series are discussed.
