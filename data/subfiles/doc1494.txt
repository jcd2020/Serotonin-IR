Branchek, T. A. and T. P. Blackburn (2000). "5-ht6 receptors as emerging targets for drug discovery." Annu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol 40: 319-334.

	5-ht6 receptors are the latest serotonin receptors to be identified by molecular cloning. Their high affinity for a wide range of drugs used in psychiatry, coupled with their intriguing distribution in the brain, has stimulated significant interest. Antisense oligonucleotides, antipeptide antibodies, selective radioligands, knockout mice, and selective antagonists of the 5-ht6 receptor have recently become available. Surprisingly, 5-ht6 receptors appear to regulate cholinergic neurotransmission in the brain, rather than the expected interaction as modulators of dopaminergic transmission. This interaction predicts a possible role for 5-ht6 receptor antagonists in the treatment of learning and memory disorders. Furthermore, polymorphisms in the sequence of the 5-ht6 receptor gene may provide a genetic tool to further our understanding of the differential responses of patients to antipsychotic medications.
