	Pimavanserin is a selective serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) inverse agonist that has shown promise for treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Here, we detail the C-11-labeling and subsequently evaluate pimavanserin as a PET-radioligand in pigs. [C-11] Pimavanserin was obtained by N-methylation of an appropriate precursor using [C-11] MeOTf in acetone at 60 degrees C giving radiochemical yields in the range of 1-1.7 GBq (n = 4). In Danish Landrace pigs the radio ligand readily entered the brain and displayed binding in the cortex in accordance with the distribution of 5-HT(2A)Rs. However, this binding could not be blocked by either ketanserin or pimavanserin itself, indicating high nonspecific binding. The lack of displacement by the 5-HT2R antagonist and binding in the thalamus suggests that [C-11] pimavanserin is not selective for the 5-HT2AR in pigs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
