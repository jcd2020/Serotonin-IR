Foley, T. E., et al. (2006). "Elevated central monoamine receptor mRNA in rats bred for high endurance capacity: implications for central fatigue." Behav Brain Res 174(1): 132-142.

	Although alteration to peripheral systems at the skeletal muscle level can contribute to one's ability to sustain endurance capacity, neural circuits regulating fatigue may also play a critical role. Previous studies demonstrated that increasing brain serotonin (5-HT) release is sufficient to hasten the onset of exercise-induced fatigue, while manipulations that increase brain dopamine (DA) release can delay the onset of fatigue. These results suggest that individual differences in endurance capacity could be due to factors capable of influencing the activity of 5-HT and DA systems. We evaluated possible differences in central fatigue pathways between two contrasting rat groups selectively bred for high (HCR) or low (LCR) capacity running. Using quantitative in situ hybridization, we measured messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptors, dopamine receptor-D2 (DR-D2) autoreceptors and postsynaptic receptors, and dopamine receptor-D1 (DR-D1) postsynaptic receptors, in discrete brain regions of HCR and LCR. HCR expressed higher levels of 5-HT1B autoreceptor mRNA in the raphe nuclei relative to LCR, but similar levels of TPH, 5-HTT, and 5-HT1A mRNA in these areas. Surprisingly, HCR expressed higher levels of DR-D2 autoreceptor mRNA in the midbrain, while simultaneously expressing greater DR-D2 postsynaptic mRNA in the striatum compared to LCR. There were no differences in DR-D1 mRNA levels in the striatum or cortex between groups. These data suggest that central serotonergic and dopaminergic systems may be involved in the mechanisms by which HCR have delayed onset of exercise-induced fatigue compared to LCR.
