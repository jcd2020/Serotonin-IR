Mullins, U. L., et al. (1999). "Effects of antidepressants on 5-HT7 receptor regulation in the rat hypothalamus." Neuropsychopharmacology 21(3): 352-367.

	Recent evidence suggests that a novel serotonin receptor 5-HT7 localized in the hypothalamus downregulates in response to treatment with the antidepressant fluoxetine (Sleight et al. 1995). This receptor has also been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythms (Lovenberg et al. 1993). Here, we show that several agents administered in a profile consistent with activity at the 5-HT7 receptor produce significant functional Fos immunoreactivity in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), an effect reduced upon chronic exposure. Furthermore, binding studies demonstrate that chronic administration of Fos-inducing agents produces a neuroadaptive downregulation of the 5-HT7 receptor in the hypothalamus. The current studies extend the previous observations to include several pharmacologically distinct antidepressants. In addition, these studies provide further evidence to support the role of the 5-HT7 receptor in the mechanism of antidepressant action and in the regulation of circadian rhythms controlled by the SCN.
