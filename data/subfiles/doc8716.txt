	The pharmacological properties of geissoschizine methyl ether, isolated from Uncaria sinensis Oliv., were analyzed in vitro and in vivo using mice central serotonin neurons. In the in vitro experiment, geissoschizine methyl ether inhibited [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT) (K-i = 0.8 muM), [H-3]mesulergine (K-i = 0.9 muM) and [H-3]ketanserin (K-i = 1.4 muM), but had less affinity toward [H-3]prazosin (K-i > 10 muM) and [H-3]spiperone (K-i > 15 muM) binding to mouse brain membranes. The in vivo studies showed that geissoschizine methyl ether dose-dependently reduced 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (I-5-HTP) plus clorgyline-induced head twitch response without inhibiting the I-5-HTP plus clorgyline and 8-OH-DPAT-induced head weaving. On the other hand, geissoschizine methyl ether also decreased the rectal temperature of mice (hypothermic response) in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that geissoschizine methyl ether possesses mixed 5-HT1A receptor agonist/5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist activities and inhibits the head twitch response by blocking the 5-HT2A receptors, and possibly, at least in part, by stimulating the 5-HT1A receptors in the central nervous system.
