Mamede Rosa, M. L. and W. A. Prado (1997). "Antinociception induced by opioid or 5-HT agonists microinjected into the anterior pretectal nucleus of the rat." Brain Res 757(1): 133-138.

	The changes in the latency for tail withdrawal in response to noxious heating of the skin induced by microinjection of opioid or serotonergic agonists into the anterior pretectal nucleus (APtN) was studied in rats. The mu-opioid agonist DAMGO (78 and 156 picomol), but not the delta-opioid agonist DADLE (70 and 140 pmol), the kappa-opioid agonist bremazocine (0.24 and 0.48 nanomol) or the sigma-opioid agonist N-allylnormetazocine (0.54 nanomol), produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect. The 5-HT1 agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (19 and 38 nanomol) and the 5-HT1B agonist, CGS 12066B (1.12 and 2.24 nanomol), but not the non-selective 5-HT agonist m-CPP (41 to 164 nanomol), 5-HT2 agonist alpha-methylserotonin (36 and 72 nanomol) and 5-HT3 agonist 2-methylserotonin (36 and 72 nanomol), produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect. These results indicate that the antinociceptive effects of opioid or serotonergic agonists microinjected into the APtN depend on drug interaction with local mu or 5-HT1B receptors, respectively.
