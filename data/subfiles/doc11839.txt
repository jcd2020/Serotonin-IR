	This study concentrates on the role of the serotonin system in mediating the proestrous effects of chlordecone on female rodent sexual behavior. The pesticide was examined within the context of serotonin changes taking place on proestrous. Between morning and evening on the day of proestrus there was an increase in 3H-5-HT binding, an increase in serotonin (5-HT) and an increase in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Proestrous treatment with chlordecone attenuated the increase in 5-HT and in 3H-5-HT binding but had no effect on 5-HIAA. These findings suggest that the pesticide blocked proestrous changes essential for the female's development of sexual receptivity. The 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, was an inefficient competitor for 3H-5-HT binding in frontal cortex of females treated with chlordecone. It is speculated that the pesticide disrupts a balance between serotonin sites which facilitate and those which inhibit sexual behavior. Consistent with this speculation, the 5-HT agonist, quipazine, partially attenuated chlordecone's reduction of sexual behavior. Finally, the rapid effects of estradiol and chlordecone on 3H-5-HT binding sites were compared in ovariectomized female rats. These results showed no resemblance between the effects of chlordecone and those of estradiol.
