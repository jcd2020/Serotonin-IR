Simansky, K. J. (1991). "PERIPHERAL 5-CARBOXAMIDOTRYPTAMINE (5-CT) ELICITS DRINKING BY STIMULATING 5-HT1-LIKE SEROTONERGIC RECEPTORS IN RATS." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 38(2): 459-462.

	Subcutaneous administration of the prototypical 5-HT1-like agonist, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), increased 2-h water intake by nondeprived rats (ED50 = 0.04-mu-mol/kg). The 5-HT1 agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.04-0.32-mu-mol/kg) and RU 24969 (0.16-mu-mol/kg) did not produce drinking. The dipsogenic effect of 5-CT (0.08-mu-mol/kg) was prevented by the 5-HT1/2 antagonist, methysergide (ID50 = 4-mu-mol/kg), but not by 16-mu-mol/kg of the 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin; the 5-HT2/1C antagonist, mianserin; or the 5-HT3 antagonist, MDL 72222. 5-CT also increased drinking and reduced food intake when food-deprived rats were given 2-h access to mash. Methysergide (16 mu-mol/kg) inhibited both actions of 5-CT but an equimolar dose of the 5-HT1/beta adrenergic antagonist, (-)-propranolol, blocked only the drinking. The 5-HT2/1C antagonist, ritanserin (16-mu-mol/kg), altered neither ingestive action of 5-CT although, by itself, ritanserin increased mash intake. The results suggest that activating a subtype of peripheral 5-HT1-like receptor stimulates drinking in rats. This receptor is unlike either the 5-HT1A or the 5-HT1C sites found in the brain. Furthermore, the dispogenic and anorectic actions of 5-CT occur independently.
