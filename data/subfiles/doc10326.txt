	This experiment was conducted to determine whether drugs acting on brain serotonin modulate the effects of the mu opioid, morphine, as measured by the squirrel monkey shock titration procedure and, if so, whether serotonergic modulation is mediated via specific 5HT receptor subtypes. Under this procedure, electric shock was delivered to the monkey's tail and scheduled to increase once every 15 s from 0.01 to 2.0 mA in 30 steps. Five responses on a lever during the 15-s shock period terminated the shock for 15 s, after which the shock resumed at the next lower intensity. The intensity below which monkeys maintained shock 50% of the time (median shock level or MSL) and rate of responding (RR) in the presence of shock were determined under control conditions and after administration of morphine alone and in combination with various serotonergic compounds. Morphine increased median shock level and decreased rate of responding in a dose-dependent manner. These effects of morphine was attenuated by the 5HT1A receptor agonists, 8-OH-DPAT [(+)-8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino tetralin HBr] and ipsapirone. The effects of morphine were not altered by the 5HT1A receptor antagonist, NAN-190 [1-(2-methoxyphenyl-4-[4-(2-phthalimido) butyl] piperazine HBr], and 5HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, the 5HT3 receptor antagonist, MDL 72222 [3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate], the alpha 2 adrenergic antagonist, yohimbine, or the alpha2 adrenergic agonist, clonidine. These results suggest that 5HT1A receptors may be involved in the effects of morphine in the shock titration procedure, whereas 5HT2, 5HT3 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors do not appear to play a role in morphine's effects in this procedure.
