Wu, Y. L., et al. (2000). "Effects of acute and chronic administration of MCI-225, a new selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor with 5-HT3 receptor blocking action, on extracellular noradrenaline levels in the hypothalamus of stressed rats." Jpn J Pharmacol 83(1): 31-38.

	In the present study, we investigated the effects of acute and chronic systemic administration of MCI-225 (4-(2-fluorophenyl)-6-methyl-2-(1-piperazinyl)thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine monohydrate hydrochloride), a newly-developed selective noradrenaline (NA) reuptake inhibitor with 5-HT3-receptor-blocking action, on extracellular NA levels in the hypothalamus of stressed and non-stressed rats by utilizing intracerebral microdialysis. Acute administration of MCI-225 (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly and dose-dependently increased extracellular NA levels in the hypothalamus in non-stressed rats. Footshock for 20 min also significantly increased NA levels in the hypothalamus of both groups of rats pretreated with vehicle and MCI-225. Although chronic administration of MCI-225 (3 or 10 mg/kg, p.o. for 14 days) did not alter the basal extracellular NA levels in the hypothalamus, the stress-induced increases in extracellular NA levels were significantly lower in rats chronically treated with MCI-225 (10 mg/kg) than those of rats pretreated with vehicle for the same period. The increase in extracellular NA levels induced by MCI-225 challenge (3 or 10 mg/kg, p.o.) were not different between rats chronically treated with MCI-225 or vehicle. These results suggest that MCI-225 enhances extracellular NA levels in the hypothalamus in both non-stressed and stressed rats by inhibiting NA uptake and that chronic systemic administration of MCI-225 did not alter basal extracellular NA levels, but reduced the increase in NA release caused by footshock stress. These data suggest the possibility that MCI-225 might possess anxiolytic and/or antidepressant properties.
