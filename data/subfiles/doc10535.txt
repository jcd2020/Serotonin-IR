Rada, P. V., et al. (1993). "In vivo modulation of acetylcholine in the nucleus accumbens of freely moving rats: I. Inhibition by serotonin." Brain Res 619(1-2): 98-104.

	Microdialysis was used to characterize the effect of serotonergic input on cholinergic interneurons in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) of freely moving rats. Local infusion of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or the serotonin reuptake blocker fluoxetine significantly decreased extracellular acetylcholine (ACh) in the NAC. This decrease in ACh was blocked by the 5-HT1 (and beta-adrenergic) antagonist propranolol. To test suggests that 5-HT inhibits ACh interneurons via one of the 5-HT1 receptor types. The 5HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT given systemically again decreased extracellular levels of ACh, and the effect was dose-dependent. The 5-HT1A effect was probably exerted in the NAC, because local infusion of 8-OH-DPAT mimicked systemic injections. These microdialysis results are similar to in vitro studies which suggest an inhibitory impact of 5-HT on ACh release in basal ganglia slices and homogenates. The decrease in extracellular ACh as measured in vivo is apparently mediated, at least in part, through a 5-HT1A receptor in the accumbens. Given the role of the NAC in behavior reinforcement, this 5-HT-ACh interaction may be involved in serotonergic treatment of depression.
