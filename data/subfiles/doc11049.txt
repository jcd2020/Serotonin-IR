	The pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD) is not fully understood and the diagnosis is largely based on history and clinical examination. So far, several lines of preclinical data and a single imaging study implicate a role for the serotoninlB (5-HTIB) receptor subtype. We sought to study 5-HTIB receptor binding in brain regions of reported relevance in patients with MDD. Subjects were examined at the Karolinska Institutet PET centre using positron emission tomography (PET) and the 5-HTIB receptor selective radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369. Ten drug -free patients with recurrent MDD and ten control subjects matched for age and sex were examined. The main outcome measure was [C-11]AZ10419369 binding in brain regions of reported relevance in the pathophysiology of MDD. The [C-11]AZ10419369 binding potential was significantly lower in the MDD group compared with the healthy control group in the anterior cingulate cortex (20% between-group difference), the subgenual prefrontal cortex (17% between-group difference), and in the hippocampus (32% between-group difference). The low anterior cingulate [C-11]AZ10419369 binding potential in patients with recurrent MDD positions 5-HTIB receptor binding in this region as a putative biomarker for MDD and corroborate a role of the anterior cingulate cortex and associated areas in the pathophysiology of recurrent MDD.
