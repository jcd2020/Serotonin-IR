Cooper, S. J., et al. (1988). "Specific effect of putative 5-HT1A agonists, 8-OH-DPAT and gepirone, to increase hypertonic saline consumption in the rat: evidence against a general hyperdipsic action." Physiol Behav 43(4): 533-537.

	Previous reports indicate that 5-HT1A agonists, in addition to benzodiazepines, increase the consumption of hypertonic saline in rehydrating rats. Experiment 1 investigated the effects of 8-OH-DPAT (10-100 micrograms/kg) and gepirone (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) on consumption of water and of saline over a range of concentrations (0.45%-2.8%) in a 30 min drinking test. The two 5-HT1A agonists dose-dependently increased ingestion of two hypertonic salt solutions, but produced little or no increase in the drinking of water, hypotonic or isotonic saline. Experiment 2 demonstrated that 8-OH-DPAT and gepirone did not enhance water consumption in animals given a water preload, or markedly increase drinking quinine-adulterated water. Taken together, the results indicate a selective dose-related effect of the two drugs to increase hypertonic saline drinking; they did not have a general hyperdipsic effect across all salt and water conditions, and they did not increase intake simply because of a low baseline level of consumption. Hence, 5-HT1A agonist act much more selectively than benzodiazepines in their effects on drinking responses.
