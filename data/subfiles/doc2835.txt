Dumuis, A., et al. (1991). "AZABICYCLOALKYL BENZIMIDAZOLONE DERIVATIVES AS A NOVEL CLASS OF POTENT AGONISTS AT THE 5-HT4 RECEPTOR POSITIVELY COUPLED TO ADENYLATE-CYCLASE IN BRAIN." Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archives of Pharmacology 343(3): 245-251.

	Recent experimental evidence indicates that central 5-HT4 receptors which are positively coupled to adenylate cyclase, are stimulated by a family of 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chloro substituted benzamide derivatives. These compounds are also potent stimulants of the gastro-intestinal motility. In this study the ability of three azabicycloalkyl benzimidazolone derivatives, BIMU 1, BIMU 8, and DAU 6215 (structural formulas are given in the text), to stimulate cAMP formation in colliculi neurons in primary culture have been tested. Two of the compounds, BIMU 1 and BIMU 8, which show prokinetic activity in various animal models, were also good agonists at the 5-HT4 receptors, whereas DAU 6215, a drug devoid of prokinetic activity, was only a weak, partial agonist at 5-HT4 receptors. The rank order of their potencies as compared with those of 5-HT and cisapride was as follows: BIMU 8 = cisapride > 5-HT > BIMU 1 > DAU 6215. The efficacies of BIMU 8 and cisapride were comparable (133 +/- 9% and 124 +/- 8% of the maximal 5-HT efficacy, respectively), whereas BIMU 1 and DAU 6215 elicited, respectively, only 72 +/- 11% and 16 +/- 4% of the maximal 5-HT effect. The activities of the azabicycloalkyl benzimidazolone derivatives and 5-HT on cAMP formation were not additive and ICS 205-930 antagonized the stimulatory effect of these compounds with low potency (pKi = 6.1 - 6.4), further strengthening the notion of interaction with 5-HT4 receptors. In addition, cross desensitization between the effects of 5-HT and the azabicycloakyl benzimidazolones on adenylate cyclase was noted, another argument in favor of an interaction of these drugs on 5-HT4 receptors.
