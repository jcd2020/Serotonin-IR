Xu, W. J., et al. (2013). "INVOLVEMENT OF VENTROLATERAL ORBITAL CORTEX 5-HT 1-7 RECEPTORS IN 5-HT INDUCED DEPRESSION OF SPARED NERVE INJURY ALLODYNIA." Neuroscience 238: 252-257.

	The present study examined the roles of ventrolateral orbital cortex (VLO) 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor subtypes in mediating 5-HT-induced antiallodynic actions in the rat spared nerve injury (SNI) pain model. Changes in paw withdrawal threshold (PWT) were measured using von-Frey filaments. Microinjection of 5-HT (2, 5 and 10 mu g, in 0.5 mu l) into the VLO depressed allodynia induced by SNI, and the PWT increased in a dose-dependent manner. Microinjection of selective 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor antagonists, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl] piperazine hydrobromide (NAN-190) (10 mu g), cyproheptadine (50 ng), granisetron hydrochloride (granisetron) (10 mu g), 1-[2-[(methylsulfonyl)-amino]ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]methyl1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate (GR113808) (5 mu g), SB699551 dihydrochloride (SB699551) (10 SB258585 dihydrochloride (SB258585) (2 mu g) or SB269970 hydrochloride (SB269970) (10 pig) into the VLO 5-min prior to 5-HT (10 mu g) injection, all antagonized the 5-HT-induced inhibition of allodynia. In addition, these antagonists applied alone to VLO did not influence allodynia. These results suggest that although 5-HT1-7 receptor subtypes in the VLO do not have a tonic modulatory action on the allodynia induced by SNI, they are involved in mediating the depression of the SNI allodynia produced by injection of 5HT into VLO.
