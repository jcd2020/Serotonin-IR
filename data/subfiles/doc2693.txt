	Recent head-twitch response (HTR) studies in mice have indicated that withdrawal from chronic cocaine exposure produces deficits in CNS conversion of L-tryptophan to 5-HT. In the present study, the ability of 5-HT releaser, d-fenfluramine, was utilized to induce the HTR in mice following abstinence from chronic cocaine exposure. d-Fentluramine-induced HTR, is a 5-HT2A receptor-mediated phenomenon and its induction frequency can be regarded as an indirect but in vivo measure of basal brain 5-HT concentration. Thus, different groups of mice were injected with cocaine twice daily (0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) for either 7 or 13 days. At 24 h after last cocaine injection the treated mice received d-fenfluramine (5 mg/kg, i.p.) and the induced HTR (mean+/-SEM) was recorded for the next 30 min. Cocaine attenuated the d-fenfluramine-induced HTR frequency by 30-37% in the 13-day regimen and significant effects were observed from 0.5 mg/kg dose. At 24 h withdrawal in the 7-day cocaine exposure group, the mean HTR frequencies were attenuated, however, they did not achieve statistical significance. Extended abstinence studies (i.e. 24, 48, 72 and 96 h postwithdrawal) from chronic cocaine exposure (0, 0.5 and 5 mg/kg/day for either 7 or 13 days) indicated that in the 7-day exposure group, significant reductions (26, 39 and 22%) in HTR frequency occurred at 48, 72 and 96 h following withdrawal from 0.5 mg/kg cocaine, whereas its 5 mg/kg dose failed to induce a significant effect. In the 13-day exposure group significant reductions in HTR frequency were observed at 24 h abstinence (27%) for the 0.5 mg/kg cocaine dose and at 24 and 48 h for the 5 mg/kg. Overall, these results indicate that abstinence from chronic exposure to cocaine produces enduring deficits in basal 5-HT concentration. Lastly, serotonergic function appears to be uniquely sensitive to chronic administration of low doses of cocaine.
