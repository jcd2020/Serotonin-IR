Gaggi, R., et al. (1997). "Actions of nimodipine on the serotonergic systems of rat brain." Gen Pharmacol 29(3): 415-419.

	1. The effects of the serotonin (5-HT) precursor, L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP), or the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OHDPAT, on behavior or brain 5-HT metabolism or both were evaluated in rats IP pretreated with nimodipine at doses ranging from 0.31 to 40 mg/kg. 2. Nimodipine, in a wide dose range (0.6-20.0 mg/kg) potentiated the head-twitch response to L-5-HTP. 3. The effects of nimodipine on the 5-HT metabolism of rats treated with L-5-HTP did not comply with the increase in the behavioral response to this 5-HT precursor. 4. Nimodipine antagonized the effects on 5-HT metabolism induced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propyl-amino)-tetralin through stimulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors. 5. It was concluded that the effects of nimodipine on brain 5-HT metabolism appeared to be linked to activation of serotonergic neurotransmission likely due to inhibition of the back-regulation mechanism mediated by presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.
