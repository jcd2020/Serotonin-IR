	Traumatic events in early life are associated with an increased risk of psychiatric diseases in adulthood. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptors are known to play a pivotal role in the 5-HTergic mechanisms associated with the etiology of stress-related disorders. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether early postnatal stress influences 5-HT(1A) receptor function in the medial prefrontal cortex in adult rats. Rats were subjected to aversive foot shock (FS) during the third week of the postnatal period (3wFS group). During the postadolescent period (10-14 weeks postnatal), immunohistochemical experiments were carried out to investigate c-Fos expression following the administration of R-(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist. In the 3wFS group, the 8-OH-DPAT-induced c-Fos expression in the medial prefrontal cortex was significantly attenuated compared to that in the non-FS control group. A dual immunofluorescence study revealed that a small proportion of c-Fos positive cells co-express parvalbumin, and a relatively large proportion of c-Fos positive cells co-express glutaminase, suggesting that most c-Fos positive cells are glutamatergic neurons. We found that local perfusion of 8-OH-DPAT via a dialysis probe decreased extracellular 5-HT levels in the medial prefrontal cortex of the non-FS group, but not in the 3wFS group. However, the levels of 8-OH-DPAT-induced 5-HT syndrome were not significantly different between the non-FS and 3wFS groups. Therefore, aversive stress in the third week of the postnatal period attenuates 5-HT(1A) receptor function in the medial prefrontal cortex in adulthood and produces feedback inhibition of the raphe nuclei via postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors.
