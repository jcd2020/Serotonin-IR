Riad, M., et al. (1991). "VISUALIZATION AND QUANTIFICATION OF CENTRAL 5-HT1A RECEPTORS WITH SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES." Neurochem Int 19(4): 413-423.

	Polyclonal antibodies were raised by the repeated injection of rabbits with synthetic peptides corresponding to selective portions (peptide 1: aminoacid residues 12-23, and peptide 2: aminoacid residues 243-268) of the aminoacid sequence of the rat 5-HT1A receptor. Both antisera allowed the immunoprecipitation of 5-HT1A receptors but not of other 5-HT receptor types and adrenergic receptors solubilized from rat hippocampal membranes. Immunoblots demonstrated that a single protein of approximately 63 kDa, corresponding to the molecular weight of the rat 5-HT1A receptor binding subunit, was recognized by each antiserum. Immunoautoradiographic labelling of rat brain sections with the anti-peptide 2-antiserum exhibited the same regional distribution as 5-HT1A sites labelled by selective radioligands such as [H-3]8-OH-DPAT and [I-125]BH-8-MeO-N-PAT. However regional differences apparently existed between the respective intensity of labelling by the agonist radioligands and the antiserum, which might be explained by variations in the degree of coupling of 5-HT1A receptor binding subunits with G proteins from one brain area to another.
