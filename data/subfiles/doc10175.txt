Pike, V. W., et al. (1995). "First delineation of 5-HT1A receptors in human brain with PET and [11C]WAY-100635." Eur J Pharmacol 283(1-3): R1-3.

	The selective 5-HT1A receptor radioligand, [11C]WAY-100635 ([11C]N-2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-2- pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide), has been injected intravenously into healthy male volunteers and studied by PET (positron emission tomography). The results provide the first delineation of 5-HT1A receptors in living human brain and demonstrate the potential to use [11C]WAY-100635 for the study of central 5-HT1A receptors in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders and for the investigation of the pharmacology of drugs acting on the central nervous system.
