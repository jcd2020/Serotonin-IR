	There is evidence for sex differences in cocaine addiction from both clinical and preclinical studies. In particular, preclinical studies indicate that females may be more sensitive than males to stress-induced drug seeking. The dorsal hippocampus (DH) is prominently involved in the stress response, as are the locus coeruleus norepinephrine (LC-NE) and dorsal raphe serotonin (DR 5-HT) systems. Moreover, DH receives strong inputs from LC-NE and DR 5-HT neurons. We hypothesized that the stress associated with non-reinforced drug seeking during early abstinence (on extinction day 1 (ED1)) may contribute to drug seeking via beta-adrenergic and 5-HT neurotransmission in DH. We observed decreased drug-seeking behavior on ED1 following 10 mg/kg S-propranolol (beta-adrenergic and 5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist), R-propranolol (5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist), or racemic propranolol in both male and female rats. ED1 increased Fos expression in DH, LC, and DR, and DH Fos was decreased by systemic S-propranolol. Based on these results, we investigated the effects of blocking 5-HT and beta-adrenoceptor transmission in DH on drug seeking during ED1 by infusing a cocktail of WAY100635 plus GR127935 (5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonists), betaxolol plus ICI-118 551 (beta1 and beta2 antagonists), or S-propranolol alone. In males, WAY100635/GR127935 was most effective in reducing drug-seeking on ED1, whereas betaxolol/ICI-118 551 was ineffective. In contrast, S-propranolol was most effective in females in reducing drug seeking on ED1, and WAY100635/GR127935 and betaxolol/ICI-118 551 were each partially effective. Our results indicate that drug seeking during initial abstinence involves 5-HT and beta-adrenergic signaling in female DH, but only 5-HT signaling in male DH.
