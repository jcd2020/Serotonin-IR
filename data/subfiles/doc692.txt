	The present study was performed to examine neuroprotective effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(3) receptor antagonists against beta-amyloid protein (25-35)-, a synthetic 25-35 amyloid peptide, induced neurotoxicity using cultured rat cortical neurons. beta-Amyloid protein (25-35) produced a concentration-dependent reduction of cell viability, which was significantly reduced by (5R,1OS)-(+)-5methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d] cyclohepten-5,10-imine (MK-801), an N-methyl-(D)-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, verapamil, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, and N-G-nitro-(L)-arginine methyl ester ((L)-NAME), a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (MDL72222, 0.1-10 mu M) and N-(I-azabicyclo[2.2.2.]oct-3-yl)-6-chloro-4-ethyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzoxazine-8-carboxamide hydrochloride (Y25130, 0.05-5 mu M), decreased the -amyloid protein (2535) (10 mu M)-induced neuronal cell death as assessed by a colorimetric 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and the number of apoptotic nuclei, evidenced by Hoechst 33342 staining. MDL72222 and Y25130 inhibited the beta-amyloid protein (25-35) (10 mu M)-induced elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+].) and glutamate release, generation of reactive oxygen species, and caspase-3 activity. These neuroprotective effects of MDL72222 (10 mu M) and Y25130 (5 mu M) were completely blocked by the simultaneous treatment with 100 mu M 1-phenylbiguanide, a 5-HT3 receptor agonist, indicating that the protective effects of these compounds were due to 5-HT3 receptor blockade. These results suggest that the activation of the 5-HT3 receptor may be partially involved in p-amyloid protein-induced neurotoxicity, by membrane depolarization for Ca2+ influx. Therefore, the blockade of 5-HT3 receptor with MDL72222 and Y25130, may ameliorate the P-amyloid protein-induced neurotoxicity by interfering with the increase of [Ca2+],, and then by inhibiting glutamate release, generation of reactive oxygen species and caspase-3 activity.
