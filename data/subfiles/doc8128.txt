	The sudden infant death syndrome is associated with a reduction in brainstem serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-HT(1A) receptor binding, yet it is unknown if and how these findings are linked. In this study, we used quantitative tissue autoradiography to determine if post-natal development of brainstem 5-HT(1A) receptors is altered in two mouse models where the development of 5-HT neurons is defective, the Lmx1b(f/f/p) , and the Pet-1(-)/(-) mouse. 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist-binding sites were examined in both 5-HT-source nuclei (autoreceptors) and in sites that receive 5-HT innervation (heteroreceptors). In control mice between post-natal day (P) 3 and 10, 5-HT(1A) receptor binding increased in several brainstem sites; by P25, there were region-specific increases and decreases, refining the overall binding pattern. In the Lmx1b(f/f/p) and Pet-1(-)/(-) mice, 5-HT(1A)-autoreceptor binding was significantly lower than in control mice at P3, and remained low at P10 and P25. In contrast, 5-HT(1A) heteroreceptor levels were comparable between control and 5-HT-deficient mice. These data define the post-natal development of 5-HT(1A)-receptor binding in the mouse brainstem. Furthermore, the data suggest that 5-HT(1A)-heteroreceptor deficits detected in sudden infant death syndrome are not a direct consequence of a 5-HT neuron dysfunction nor reduced brain 5-HT levels. To elucidate the developmental relationship between serotonin (5-HT) levels and 5-HT(1A) receptors in the brainstem, we examined 5-HT(1A) binding in two 5-HT-deficient mouse models. In nuclei containing 5-HT neurons, 5-HT(1A) binding was decreased (autoreceptors), while binding was maintained in projection sites (heteroreceptors). Thus, brainstem 5-HT(1A)-heteroreceptor-binding sites do not appear developmentally sensitive to reduced brain 5-HT levels.
