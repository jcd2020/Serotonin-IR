Zgombick, J. M. and T. A. Branchek (1998). "Native 5-HT1B receptors expressed in OH cells display dual coupling to elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations and inhibition of adenylate cyclase." Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archives of Pharmacology 358(5): 503-508.

	The opossum kidney (OK) cell line has been shown previously to express endogenous 5-HT1B receptors which negatively couple to adenylate cyclase. Since other Gi-linked receptors have been shown to inhibit adenylate cyclase and to elevate intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca2+](i)), studies were initiated to determine whether native opossum 5-HT1B receptors could also display dual coupling to these signal transduction mechanisms. Saturation studies using [I-125](-)-iodocyanopindolol ([I-125]CYP) to radiolabel the 5-HT1B receptor in OK cell membranes (in the presence of 3 mu M (-)-isoproterenol to mask beta-adrenergic receptors) yielded an equilibrium dissociation constant (pK(d)) of 10.04 and binding site density (B-max) of 55 fmol/mg protein. Exposure of intact OK cells to 5-HT, CP 93,129, a selective rodent 5-MT1B receptor agonist, and (+/-)-cyanopindolol, a mixed 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist/antagonist, produced concentration-dependent inhibitions of forskolin (3 mu M)-stimulated cAMP accumulation (FSCA; E-max=90-95%) and elevations of [Ca2+](i) (E(max)similar to 200 nM increase above basal levels). Agonist potencies (pEC(50)) ranged from 9.7 to 8.1 and were comparable between the two second messenger assays, although slightly higher agonist potencies (similar to threefold) were observed in the cAMP assay. GR 127,935, a selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist, behaved as a strong partial agonist in both the cAMP and calcium assays, with an intrinsic activity of 0.7 relative to 5-HT. Methiothepin, a nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist, competitively antagonized the inhibitory cAMP response elicited by CP 93,129, yielding an apparent pK(b) value of 7.3. Methiothepin (10 mu M) completely antagonized the stimulatory calcium response evoked by a saturating concentration of CP 93,129 (100 nM). Pertussis toxin pretreatment blocked the CP 93,129-induced inhibition of FSCA and elevation of [Ca2+](i) in OK cells, indicating the involvement of G(i/o) proteins in transducing these second messenger responses. The agonist properties of (+/-)-cyanopindolol and GR 127,935 observed in both second messenger assays suggests that a large degree of receptor reserve may be present, even though 5-HT1B receptor expression is low in OK cells. The OK cell line continues to serve as a model system to investigate 5-HT1B receptor-mediated signaling events.
