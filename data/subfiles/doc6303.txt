	Aims Alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) aggregation is a neuropathological hallmark of neurodegenerative synucleinopathies. This in vivo study explored glucose metabolism and dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission in KO alpha-syn, wild-type mice and an accelerated murine model of synucleinopathy (M83). Methods MicroPET acquisitions were performed in all animals aged 5-6 months using five radiotracers exploring brain glucose metabolism ([F-18]FDG), dopamine neurotransmission ([C-11]raclopride, [C-11]PE2I) and serotonin neurotransmission ([F-18]MPPF, [C-11]DASB). For all radiotracers, except [F-18]FDG, PET data were analyzed with a MRI-based VOI method and a voxel-based analysis. Results MicroPET data showed a decrease in [C-11]raclopride uptake in the caudate putamen of KO alpha-syn mice, in comparison with M83 and WT mice, reflecting a lower concentration of D-2 receptors. The increase in [F-18]MPPF uptake in M83 vs WT and KO mice indicates overexpression of 5-HT1A receptors. The lack of change in dopamine and serotonin transporters in all groups suggests unchanged neuronal density. Conclusions This PET study highlights an effect of alpha-syn modulation on the expression of the D-2 receptor, whereas aggregated alpha-syn leads to overexpression of 5-HT1A receptor, as a pathophysiological signature.
