Andersen, V. L., et al. (2015). "(11)C-labeling and preliminary evaluation of pimavanserin as a 5-HT2A receptor PET-radioligand." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 25(5): 1053-1056.

	Pimavanserin is a selective serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) inverse agonist that has shown promise for treatment of psychotic symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Here, we detail the (11)C-labeling and subsequently evaluate pimavanserin as a PET-radioligand in pigs. [(11)C]Pimavanserin was obtained by N-methylation of an appropriate precursor using [(11)C]MeOTf in acetone at 60 degrees C giving radiochemical yields in the range of 1-1.7GBq (n=4). In Danish Landrace pigs the radio ligand readily entered the brain and displayed binding in the cortex in accordance with the distribution of 5-HT2ARs. However, this binding could not be blocked by either ketanserin or pimavanserin itself, indicating high nonspecific binding. The lack of displacement by the 5-HT2R antagonist and binding in the thalamus suggests that [(11)C]pimavanserin is not selective for the 5-HT2AR in pigs.
