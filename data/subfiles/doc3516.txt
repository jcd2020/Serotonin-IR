Fukushima, H., et al. (1998). "Inhibition of glycine-induced current by morphine in nucleus tractus solitarii neurones of guinea pigs." Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol 20(2): 125-132.

	We studied the effect of morphine on the current induced by glycine in acutely dissociated nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) neurones of guinea pigs, by use of the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Morphine inhibited 30 microM glycine-induced current (Igly), without affecting the current caused by 30 microM GABA. The effect of morphine was concentration-dependent, with a maximal effect at 1 mM, and reversible. The half-maximum inhibitory concentration of morphine was 30 microM. The effect of morphine was not depressed by naloxone, an opioid antagonist. Furthermore, the effect was not substantially affected by methiothepin, a 5-HT1 antagonist, ketanserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist and MDL-72222, a 5-HT3 antagonist. Morphine at 30 microM shifted the concentration-response curve for Igly to the right without affecting the maximum value. The effect of morphine on Igly showed no use-dependence. The results indicate that morphine inhibits Igly in the NTS neurones, and further suggest that morphine at the concentration used may act on the glycine receptor-ionophore complex, but not on the Cl-channel of the complex.
