Kannari, K., et al. (2001). "Activation of 5-HT(1A) but not 5-HT(1B) receptors attenuates an increase in extracellular dopamine derived from exogenously administered L-DOPA in the striatum with nigrostriatal denervation." J Neurochem 76(5): 1346-1353.

	In order to determine whether L-DOPA-derived extracellular dopamine (DA) in the striatum with dopaminergic denervation is affected by activation of serotonin autoreceptors (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors), we applied in vivo brain microdialysis technique to 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats and examined the effects of the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist CGS-12066 A on L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA levels. Single L-DOPA injection (50 mg/kg i.p.) caused a rapid increase and a following decrease of extracellular DA, with a peak value at 100 min after L-DOPA injection. Pretreatment with both 0.3 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT (i.p.) significantly attenuated an increase in L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA and the times of peak DA levels were prolonged to 150 min and 225 min after L-DOPA injection, respectively. These 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes in L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA were antagonized by further pretreatment with WAY-100635, a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist. In contrast, intrastriatal perfusion with the 5-HT(1B) agonist CGS-12066 A (10 nM and 100 nM) did not induce any changes in L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA. Thus, stimulation of 5-HT(1A) but not 5-HT(1B) receptors attenuated an increase in extracellular DA derived from exogenous L-DOPA. These results support the hypothesis that serotonergic neurons are primarily responsible for the storage and release of DA derived from exogenous L-DOPA in the absence of dopaminergic neurons.
