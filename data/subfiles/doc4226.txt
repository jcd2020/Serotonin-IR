Haleem, D. J., et al. (1990). "Hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine synthesis is greater in female rats than in males and more decreased by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT." J Neural Transm Gen Sect 79(1-2): 93-101.

	Brain regional 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and/or 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations tended to be slightly higher in female rats than in males but differences were substantial only in the hippocampus where female values were 34% and 36% higher respectively. These findings were consistent with the synthesis rates of 5-HT as this was 53% greater in the female than in the male hippocampi. Other regions did not show significant sex differences. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 1 mg/kg sc) caused comparable decreases of 5-HT synthesis rate in both sexes and in all regions studied except the hippocampus where the percentage decrease was twice as large in the females (-64%) as in the males (-32%) so that the sex difference in 5-HT synthesis in this region largely disappeared. The results are discussed in relation to sex differences in behaviour and hippocampal function.
