Odagaki, Y. and K. Fuxe (1995). "5-HT1A RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ACTIVATION OF HIGH-AFFINITY GTPASE IN RAT HIPPOCAMPAL MEMBRANES." European Journal of Pharmacology-Molecular Pharmacology Section 288(3): 385-388.

	GTP hydrolyzing activity was assayed by measuring the amount of P-32(i) released from 0.3 mu M [gamma-P-32]GTP in the membranes prepared from rat brain. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) stimulated the high-affinity GTPase activity in hippocampus, but not in striatum, in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC(50) value of 18 nM and maximal percent stimulation of 13.9%. This response was mimicked by (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin [(+/-)-8-OH-DPAT], but not by (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophyenyl)-2-aminopropane [(+/-)-DOI]. These results suggest that 5-HT-stimulated high-affinity GTPase activity of the GTP-binding protein(s) is mediated via 5-HT1A receptor subtype in the rat hippocampus.
