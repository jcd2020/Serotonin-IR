	Introduction. Serotonin (5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter for sexual behaviors. Heterozygous (+/-) serotonin transporter (SERT) rats and SERT knockout rats (-/-) have serotonergic disturbances with significant elevations of basal extracellular 5-HT levels. Aim. To investigate the putative role of the SERT in male sexual behavior. Methods. After extensive sexual training, the effects of the 5-HT(1A/7) receptor agonist +/- 8-OH-DPAT, the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100 635 and a combination of both on sexual behaviors of SERT-/- and SERT+/- knockout and wildtype (SERT+/+) male Wistar rats were examined. Main Outcome Measures. Male rat sexual behaviors of mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations. Results. SERT-/- had lower basal ejaculation frequencies than SERT+/- and SERT+/+ animals. +/- 8-OH-DPAT enhanced sexual performance in all three genotypes to the same extent. WAY100635 dose-dependently inhibited sexual behavior in all three genotypes with significant dose to genotype interactions. WAY100635 exerted the strongest effects in SERT-/- animals. The combination of a dose range of +/- 8-OH-DPAT and a selected dose of WAY100635 revealed only partial antagonism by +/- 8-OH-DPAT of the sexual inhibitory effects of WAY100635. Conclusions. Absence of the serotonin transporter reduces basal ejaculatory performance in male rats. Pharmacological experiments suggest that separate pools of 5-HT(1A) receptors regulate different aspects of sexual performance in male rats. 5-HT(7) receptors may play a minor role in the partial recovery of sexual behavior after combination of +/- 8-OH-DPAT and WAY100635. The SERT-/- rat may be a model for chronic SSRI treatment, delayed ejaculation, anorgasmia, and/or low libido. Chan JSW, Snoeren EMS, Cuppen E, Waldinger MD, Olivier B, and Oosting RS.
