Koulu, M., et al. (1990). "Effects of chronic administration of ondansetron (GR38032F), a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, on monoamine metabolism in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and on striatal D2-receptor binding." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 101(2): 168-171.

	The effects of chronic administration of the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (GR38032F) on dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) metabolism in the major ascending dopaminergic neurons and on striatal D2-receptor binding characteristics were investigated. The metabolism of 5-HT was also studied in a number of other brain areas. Chronic ondansetron (0.2 mg/kg/day and 1.0 mg/kg/day SC for 16 days) did not change DA or 5-HT metabolism in the nigrostriatal or mesolimbic dopaminergic areas, although the larger dose of ondansetron slightly and statistically significantly reduced basal concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the nucleus caudatus. D2-receptor binding characteristics were not affected in the caudate-putamen. Ondansetron did not change 5-HT metabolism in the nucleus raphe dorsalis, amygdala, hippocampus or in habenula. It is concluded that chronic administration of ondansetron does not change DA or 5-HT metabolism in the major ascending dopaminergic neurons. This suggest that unlike chronic D2-receptor blockade, chronic blockade of central 5-HT3 receptors does not result in a similar reduction in the activity of nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons.
