Funahashi, M., et al. (2004). "Activation of presynaptic 5-HT3 receptors facilities glutamatergic synaptic inputs to area postrema neurons in rat brain slices." Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology 26(8): 615-622.

	Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were performed to investigate the serotonergic modulation of neurotransmitter release onto rat area postrenia neurons in vitro. The bath application of serotonin (5-HT- 50 muM) or phenylbiguanide (PBA; 50 mum), a potent 5-HT, receptor agonist, increased the frequency of spontaneous excitatory, postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) or miniature EPSCs (inEPSCs) in 35 of 83 neurons (42%). These increases occurred in all electrophysiological cell classes. No cells exhibited a decrease in EPSC frequency The majority of responding cells showed no inward currents during the application of serotonergic agonists (n = 34135). However, the amplitude of mEPSCs was increased in 11/11 cells with 5-HT or 3111 cells with PBA. ICS-205,930, a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, markedly, suppressed the 5-HT-inducedjacilitation of sEPSCs (n = 5) or mEPSCs (it = 5). An increase in the frequency of mEPSCs after PBA exposure was found, even with media containing Cd2+ (50 muM) or zero Ca2+. mEPSCs and evoked EPSCs were completely, blocked in media containing the non-NMDA ionotropic receptor antagonist, CNQX (10 muM), indicating that EPSCs were glutamate events. These results suggest that glutamate release is increased in the area postrenia by presynaptic 5-HT, receptor activation. Furthermore, we present evidence that 5-HT, receptor activation may be able to directly release glutamate from terminals, bypassing a requirement for voltage-dependent calcium entry into terminals. Such a mechanism may contribute to the chemosensitive function of area postrema neurons. (C) 2004 Prous Science. All rights reserved.
