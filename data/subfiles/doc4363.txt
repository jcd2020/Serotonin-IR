	Present Parkinson's disease treatment strategies are far from ideal for a variety of reasons; it has therefore been suggested that partial dopamine receptor agonism might be a potential therapeutic approach with potentially fewer side effects. In the present study, we describe the in vitro characterization of the nonergot ligand SLV308 (7-[4-methyl-1-piperazinyl]-2(3H)-benzoxazolonemonohydrochloride). SLV308 binds to dopamine D(2), D(3), and D(4) receptors and 5-HT(1) (A) receptors and is a partial agonist at dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors and a full agonist at serotonin 5-HT(1) (A) receptors. At cloned human dopamine D(2,L) receptors, SLV308 acted as a potent but partial D(2) receptor agonist (pEC(50) = 8.0 and pA(2) = 8.4) with an efficacy of 50% on forskolin stimulated cAMP accumulation. At human recombinant dopamine D(3) receptors, SLV308 acted as a partial agonist in the induction of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding (intrinsic activity of 67%; pEC(50) = 9.2) and antagonized the dopamine induction of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding (pA(2) = 9.0). SLV308 acted as a full 5-HT(1) (A) receptor agonist on forskolin induced cAMP accumulation at cloned human 5-HT(1) (A) receptors but with low potency (pEC(50) = 6.3). In rat striatal slices SLV308 concentration-dependently attenuated forskolin stimulated accumulation of cAMP, as expected for a dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptor agonist. SLV308 antagonized the inhibitory effect of quinpirole on K(+)-stimulated [(3)H]-dopamine release from rat striatal slices (pA(2) = 8.5). In the same paradigm, SLV308 had antagonist properties in the presence of quinpirole (pA(2) = 8.5), but the partial D(2) agonist terguride had much stronger antagonistic properties. In conclusion, SLV308 combines high potency partial agonism at dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors with full efficacy low potency serotonin 5-HT(1) (A) receptor agonism and is worthy of profiling in in vivo models of Parkinson's disease.
