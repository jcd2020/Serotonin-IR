	In view of the demonstration of specific binding sites for [125I]galanin-(1-15) in several brain areas including the nucleus of the solitary tract, possibly indicating the existence of multiple galanin receptor subtypes, the effects of intracisternal injections of galanin-(1-15) on cardiovascular parameters were studied. The effects of co-injections of galanin-(1-15) and galanin-(1-29) and co-injections of galanin-(1-15) and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were also evaluated. Galanin-(1-15) produced a significant increase in mean arterial blood pressure (maximum effect 10% at 3 nmol of galanin-(1-15)) and in heart rate (maximum effect 12% at 1 nmol). When threshold doses of galanin-(1-15) (0.1 nmol) and galanin-(1-29) (3 nmol) were injected simultaneously they elicited an increase in mean arterial blood pressure. The vasodepressor response induced by an ED50 dose of 8-OH-DPAT (6 nmol) was not modulated by a threshold dose of galanin-(1-15), but the increase in heart rate area induced by galanin-(1-15) alone was no longer observed. When threshold doses of both galanin-(1-15) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 nmol) were co-injected a vasodepressor response developed and on heart rate a tachycardic response was seen in the peak effects and the overall tachycardic response induced by galanin-(1-15) was sustained. The results show a different role for galanin-(1-15) as compared with galanin-(1-29) in central cardiovascular control.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
