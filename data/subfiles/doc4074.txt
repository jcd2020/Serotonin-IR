Gullikson, G. W., et al. (1993). "SC-49518 ENHANCES GASTRIC-EMPTYING OF SOLID AND LIQUID MEALS AND STIMULATES GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY IN DOGS BY A 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE4 RECEPTOR MECHANISM." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 264(1): 240-248.

	SC-49518 {N-[exo-(hexahydro-1H-pyrrolizine-1-yl)methyl]-2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chlorobenzamide HCl}, a new benzamide gastrointestinal prokinetic compound, was investigated to determine its ability to stimulate gastrointestinal motility in vivo and whether these actions could be mediated by agonist activity at the putative 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)4 receptor. In conscious fasted dogs with strain gauge transducers and myoelectrodes, SC-49518 disrupted gastric and small intestinal migrating motility complex cycling for more than 3.5 hr. It stimulated gastric antral contractile and intestinal myoelectric spike burst activities during the normally quiescent Phase I of the migrating motility complex at doses as low as 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg i.v., respectively. In a canine model of gastroparesis, SC-49518 reversed completely alpha-2 adrenergically delayed gastric emptying of a solid meal with an ED50 value of 0.1 mg/kg intragastrically and partially reversed delayed emptying of a liquid meal. SC-49518, like 5-HT, cisapride and renzapride, acted as an agonist (EC50 = 6.6 +/- 1.1 1.1 x 10(-8) M) at the putative 5-HT4 receptor in rat esophageal tunica muscularis mucosae by relaxing carbachol-induced contractions. SC-49518 was a partial agonist at 5-HT4 receptors, but also blocked high affinity (5-HT4-mediated) responses to 5-HT (10(-9) M to 3 x 10(-7) M) in guinea pig ileum with a pA2 value of 8.39. In addition to 5-HT4 agonism, SC-49518 possessed weak 5-HT3 antagonist activity with an IC50 value of 3.5 x 10(-6) M against 2-methyl-5-HT (10(-5) M) contractions in guinea pig ileum in vitro and an ID50 value of 0.6 mg/kg i.v. against cisplatin emesis in dogs. SC-49518 lacked affinity at other 5-HT (5-HT1 and 5-HT2) receptors and dopamine2 receptors which are frequently observed with benzamide prokinetic drugs. SC-49518 is a selective 5-HT4 receptor agonist which stimulates gastrointestinal motility by this mechanism of action.
