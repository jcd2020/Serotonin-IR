Cheng, F. C., et al. (2010). "Receptor Binding Activities of Chlorella on Cysteinyl Leukotriene CysLT, Glutamate AMPA, Ion Channels, Purinergic P-2Y, Tachykinin NK2 Receptors and Adenosine Transporter." Phytotherapy Research 24(1): 43-48.

	A Chlorella powder was tested in a total of 129 in vitro receptor binding assay systems. The results showed a potent inhibition of this powder on cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT2, and glutamate AMPA in a dose-concentration manner with IC50 mean SEM values of 20 +/- 4.5 mu g/mL and 44 +/- 14 mu g/mL, respectively. Other moderate and weak activities reflected in competitive binding experiments were seen versus adenosine transporter; calcium channel L-type, benzothiazepine; gabapentin; kainate, NMDA-glycine; inositol trisphosphate IP3; cysteinyl CysLT(1), LTB4; purinergic P-2Y; tachykinin NK2; serotonin 5-HT2B and prostanoid, thromboxane A(2). Together, the results suggest that the various inhibitory effects of Chlorella powder in these receptor binding assays could reflect its actions in modulating Ca2+-dependent signal related targets and might be relevant to the mechanisms of its biological effects. These results reveal important potential biochemical activities that might be exploited for the prevention or treatment of several pathologies. From these results, the possible therapeutic usage of the product is discussed. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
