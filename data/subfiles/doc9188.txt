	Large amounts of 5-HT are present in the mammalian intestine where the amine is concentrated in the enterochromaffin cells (ECs) of the mucosa. ECs have the enzymes to synthesize 5-HT, are endowed with a specific, imipramine-sensitive 5-HT uptake mechanism and can store 5-HT in specific secretory vesicles. ECs can secrete 5-HT in a calcium-dependent manner. In particular, calcium influx through voltage-regulated channels and receptor-mediated liberation of intracellular calcium can evoke 5-HT release. 5-HT secretion from ECs occurs predominantly at the interstitial side and is controlled by a complex pattern of receptor-mediated mechanisms. Stimulatory receptors (beta-adrenoceptors, muscarine, nicotine and 5-HT3 receptors) and inhibitory receptors (alpha 2-adrenoceptors, histamine H3, GABAA- and GABAB-, A2 and P2y alpha purine and 5-HT4 receptors as well as receptors for vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), pituitary adenylate cyclase stimulating peptide (PACAP) and somatostatin) have been shown to be involved in the control of 5-HT release from the ECs.
