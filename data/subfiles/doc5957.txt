	The present study was conducted to investigate the effects of two noncompetitive alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonists, GYKI 52466 and GYKI 53405 (the racemate of talampanel) on the generation of spike-wave discharges (SWD) parallel with the vigilance and behavioral changes in the genetic absence epilepsy model of WAG/Rij rats. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of GYKI 52466 (1-[4-aminophenyl]-4-methyl-7,8-methylenedioxy-5H-2,3-benzodiazepine; 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.), the prototypic compound of the 2,3-benzodiazepine family, caused a fast dose-dependent increase in the number and cumulative duration of SWD. These changes were accompanied by dose-dependent increase in duration of light slow wave sleep (SWS1) and passive awake, vigilance states associated with the presence of SWD. In addition a short, transient behavioral activation occurred that was followed by strong ataxia and immobility, decrease of active wakefulness and increase in deep slow wave sleep. GYKI 53405 (7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8-methyl-8,9-dihydro-7H-1,3-dioxolo[4,5-b][2,3]benzod iazepine, the racemate of talampanel, 16 mg/kg, i.p.) failed to affect any measure of SWD and vigilance. When used as a pretreatment, GYKI 52466 (10 mg/kg) slightly attenuated SWD-promoting effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, it decreased cumulative duration and average time of paroxysms. In conclusion, AMPA receptors play moderate role in regulation of epileptic activity, and some of these effects are connected to their effects on vigilance in this model.
