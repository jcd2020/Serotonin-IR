	Dipole potential is the potential difference within the membrane bilayer, which originates due to the nonrandom arrangement of lipid dipoles and water molecules at the membrane interface. In this work, we have explored the possible correlation between functional modulation of a G protein-coupled receptor (the serotonin(1A) receptor) and membrane dipole potential, under conditions of altered membrane sterol composition. We have previously shown that the ligand binding activity of the hippocampal serotonin(1A) receptor is reduced upon cholesterol depletion and could be restored upon replenishment with cholesterol. Interestingly, when the replenishment was carried out with an immediate biosynthetic precursor of cholesterol (7-DHC), differing with cholesterol merely in a double bond, the ligand binding activity of the receptor was not restored. In order to understand the mechanistic framework of receptor-cholesterol interaction, we carried out dipole potential measurements of hippocampal membranes under these conditions, by the dual wavelength ratiometric approach using an electrochromic probe (di-8-ANEPPS). We show here that dipole potential of hippocampal membranes is reduced upon progressive depletion of cholesterol and is restored upon replenishment with cholesterol, but not with 7-DHC. Our results show that the recovery of ligand binding activity of the serotonin(1A) receptor upon replenishment with cholesterol (but not with 7-DHC) could be related to the differential ability of these closely related sterols to modulate membrane dipole potential. We conclude that subtle changes in membrane dipole potential could be crucial in understanding the complex interplay between membrane lipids and proteins in the cellular milieu.
