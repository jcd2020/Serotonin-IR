Kajekar, R., et al. (1995). "Effect of a 5-HT1 receptor agonist, CP-122,288, on oedema formation induced by stimulation of the rat saphenous nerve." Br J Pharmacol 115(1): 1-2.

	Neurogenic oedema formation in the rat hind paw skin induced by electrical stimulation of the saphenous nerve and measured by extravasation of [125I]-albumin, was inhibited by the 5-HT1B receptor agonist, CP-93,129, and the novel tryptamine analogue, CP-122,288. Significant inhibition of up to 66% of control was observed with CP-122,288 (2 x 10(-14) - 2 x 10(-7) mol kg-1) and CP-93,129 (5 x 10(-7) - 5 x 10(-6) mol kg-1), with the minimum effective dose for CP-122,288 being about 10(7) fold less than that for CP-93,129. Oedema formation induced by the intradermal administration of exogenous mediators (substance P and histamine) in rat dorsal skin was not inhibited by CP-122,288 (2 x 10(-10) mol kg-1). These results suggest that CP-122,288 is a potent inhibitor of neurogenic inflammation in rat skin and that the effect may be due to a prejunctional inhibition of neuropeptide release.
