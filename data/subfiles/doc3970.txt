	The actions of 5-HT1A receptors on cell proliferation in the rat neonatal dentate gyrus are unknown. We injected a 5-HT1A receptor agonist (ipsapirone) or antagonist (Way 100635) 1 h before injections of BrdU in neonates of both genders between days 2-4, a peak time of dentate gyrus granule cell proliferation. The BrdU immunoreactive (IR) nuclei in the granule cell layer and subgranular zone were examined after 2 weeks. The BrdU-IR nuclear staining patterns were classified as being either diffuse (homogenous dark BrdU-staining throughout the nucleus) or punctate (multiple distinct small stained spots within the nucleus). Most BrdU-Iabeled nuclei with a diffuse pattern were seen in the subgranular zone while the punctate pattern nuclei were seen within the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus. 5-HT1A antagonist showed no overall change in absolute number or pattern of labeled nuclei compared to control animals. After a 5-HT1A agonist, there was also no differences in the total number of BrdU-IR nuclei (punctate and diffuse pattern). However, in both genders, the proportion of the BrdU-Iabeled nuclei showing a punctate compared to diffuse pattern increased: 33% in females and 18% in males. In females, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist increased the number of nuclei showing a punctate pattern by 41%, while in males the 5-HT1A receptor agonist decreased the number of nuclei showing a diffuse pattern by 29%. These results indicate gender-specific 5-HT1A receptor action on the state of nuclear DNA in the cells of the dentate gyrus, without increasing the total number of BrdU-Iabeled nuclei.
