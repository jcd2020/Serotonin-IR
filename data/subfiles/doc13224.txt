	We examined the role of serotonin (5-HT) and the 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the anorectic effects of centrally administered lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), and leptin. Food intake was measured in rats after intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of LPS (20 ng), IL-1 beta (10 ng), or leptin (1 microg) at lights out, followed by intraperitoneal (IP) injections of either the 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT) (125 microg/kg) or the 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist SB 242084 (0.3 mg/kg) at the onset of anorexia. SB 242084 significantly attenuated the food intake reduction caused by all compounds (all P<.01). IP 8-OH-DPAT attenuated ICV IL-1 beta-induced anorexia (P<.01). We also tested the involvement of the median raphe 5-HT(1A) receptors in peripheral LPS- and IL-1 beta-induced anorexia. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with either LPS (100 microg/kg) or IL-1 beta (2 microg/kg) at lights out, and 8-OH-DPAT (4 nmol) was administered directly into the median raphe nucleus at the onset of anorexia. Median raphe injections of 8-OH-DPAT significantly attenuated both IL-1 beta- and LPS-induced anorexia (both P<.01). These results implicate the 5-HT(2C) receptors in the mediation of central LPS-, IL-1 beta-, and leptin-induced anorexia. Our results also suggest that the midbrain raphe nuclei play a role in mediating the anorectic response to peripheral LPS and IL-1 beta.
