	We have studied the regulation of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid) receptor channels by serotonin signaling in pyramidal neurons of prefrontal cortex (PFC). Application of serotonin reduced the amplitude of AMPA-evoked currents, an effect mimicked by 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists and blocked by 5-HT(1A) antagonists, indicating the mediation by 5-HT(1A) receptors. The serotonergic modulation of AMPA receptor currents was blocked by protein kinase A (PKA) activators and occluded by PKA inhibitors. Inhibiting the catalytic activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) also eliminated the effect of serotonin on AMPA currents. Furthermore, the serotonergic modulation of AMPA currents was occluded by application of the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors and blocked by intracellular injection of calmodulin or recombinant CaMKII. Application of serotonin or 5-HT(1A) agonists to PFC slices reduced CaMKII activity and the phosphorylation of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 at the CaMKII site in a PP1-dependent manner. We concluded that serotonin, by activating 5-HT(1A) receptors, suppress glutamatergic signaling through the inhibition of CaMKII, which is achieved by the inhibition of PKA and ensuing activation of PP1. This modulation demonstrates the critical role of CaMKII in serotonergic regulation of PFC neuronal activity, which may explain the neuropsychiatric behavioral phenotypes seen in CaMKII knockout mice.
