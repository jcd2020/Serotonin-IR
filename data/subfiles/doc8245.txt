	Serotonin (5-HT) is a neurotransmitter that is involved in many behavioral functions, including the organization of defense, and its putative pathological correlate, anxiety and stress disorders. Recently, behavioral tests for anxiety have been proposed in zebrafish. Exposure to the novel tank test or to the light/dark test increased extracellular fluid 5-HT content in the brain; anxiety-like behavior correlated positively with 5-HT content in the novel tank test, while the correlation was negative in the light/dark test. Acute treatment with a low dose of fluoxetine was anxiolytic in thezeotaxis test and anxiogenic in the scototaxis test, while treatment with a higher dose produced a hyperlocomotor effect in both tasks. Buspirone and WAY 100635 were anxiolytic in both tests, while SB 224289 was anxiolytic in the geotaxis and slightly anxiogenic in the scototaxis test. Serotonin depletion with pCPA was anxiogenic in the geotaxis and anxiolytic in scototaxis. These results underline the differential sensitivity of these tasks to assess serotonergic agents; alternatively, serotonin might regulate zebrafish behavior differently in the novel tank test and in the light/dark test.
