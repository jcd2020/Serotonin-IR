	In order to investigate the contribution of serotonergic effects of cocaine to Pavlovian conditioning of cocaine locomotor stimulant effects, two experiments were conducted in which groups of rats (N = 10) received cocaine treatments (10 mg/kg) paired or unpaired to placement in an open-field environment. Initially a, cocaine conditioned locomotion stimulant effect was established. Next, additional Coc-P and Coc-UP pairings were carried Out in conjunction with pretreatment injections of the 5-HT(1A) agonist, 8-OHDPAT (0.01, 0.025 and 0,05 mg/kg) or saline. In experiment 1, the Coc-P group which received the saline pretreatment again exhibited conditioning but in the 8-OHDPAT pretreatment Coc-P group conditioning was eliminated. In the second experiment, the protocol of the first experiment was repeated but expanded in the post-conditioning phase to include an 8-OHDPAT plus the 5-HT(1A) antagonist pretreatment Coc-P group. As in the first experiment, the 8-OHDPAT pretreatment Coc-P group did not exhibit a cocaine conditioned locomotion stimulant effect; whereas, the saline pretreatment Coc-P and the 8-OHDPAT plus WAY-100635 pretreatment Coc-P groups did exhibit the cocaine conditioned locomotion stimulant effect. These findings are consistent With all important role for serotonin in the maintenance of cocaine Pavlovian conditioned effects. Published by Elsevier Inc.
