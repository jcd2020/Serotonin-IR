Calcagno, E., et al. (2006). "The 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT prevents prefrontocortical glutamate and serotonin release in response to blockade of cortical NMDA receptors." J Neurochem 96(3): 853-860.

	We studied the role of 5-HT(1A) receptors in controlling the release of glutamate (GLU) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of conscious rats with the in vivo microdialysis technique. The effect of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin infused in the prefrontal cortex was examined under basal conditions and on the rise of extracellular GLU (+106%) induced by co-infusion of the competitive N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist 3-[(R)-2-carboxypiperazin-4yl]-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP). 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 and 3 microm) had no effect on basal extracellular GLU, but the higher concentration completely abolished the rise of extracellular GLU induced by CPP. CPP also increased extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in the mPFC (+50%) and this effect was antagonized by 3 microm 8-OH-DPAT which, by itself, had no effect on basal 5-HT release. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT on extracellular GLU and 5-HT were reversed by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100 635 (100 microm), indicating a selective involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors. WAY100 635 had no effect by itself. These results show that the stimulation of cortical 5-HT(1A) receptors prevents the CPP-evoked rise of extracellular GLU and 5-HT and suggest that these effects may contribute to the ability of intracortical 8-OH-DPAT to counteract cognitive deficits caused by the blockade of NMDA receptors.
