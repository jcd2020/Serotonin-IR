	1. C-fibre activation induces a long-term potentiation (LTP) in the spinal flexion reflex in mammals, presumably to provide enhanced reflexive protection of damaged tissue from further injury, Descending monoaminergic pathways are thought to depress sensory input but may also amplify spinal reflexes; the mechanisms of this modulation within the spinal cord 2. We used electrical stimulation of primary afferents and recordings of motor output, in the rat lumbar spinal cord maintained in vitro, to demonstrate that serotonin is capable of inducing a long-lasting increase in reflex strength at all ages examined (postnatal days 2-12). 3. Pharmacological analyses indicated an essential requirement for activation of 5-HTD2C receptors, while 5-HT1A/1B, 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptor activation was not required. In addition, primary afferent-evoked synaptic potentials recorded in a subpopulation of laminae ITT-VT spinal neurons were similarly facilitated by 5-HT. Thus, serotonin receptor-evoked facilitatory actions are complex, and may involve alterations in neuronal properties at both motoneuronal and pre-motoneuronal levels. 4. This study provides the first demonstration of a descending transmitter producing a longlasting amplification in reflex strength, accomplished by activating a specific serotonin receptor subtype. It is suggested that brain modulatory systems regulate reflex pathways to function within an appropriate range of sensori-motor gain, facilitating reflexes in behavioural situations requiring increased sensory responsiveness.
