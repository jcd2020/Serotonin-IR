	During the last 5 years neuroprotective effects of drugs have been intensively investigated. Various in vivo and in vitro models are available for testing neuroprotective actions of drugs. Calcium antagonists, glutamate antagonists, oxygen radical scavengers, 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) agonists and platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonists are experimentally well characterized as neuroprotectives and, thus, provide a basis for the development of clinically effective drugs.
