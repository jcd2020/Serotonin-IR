Wilkinson, L. O., et al. (1993). "Stereoselective actions of the isomers of metitepine at 5-HT1D receptors in the guinea pig brain." Neuropharmacology 32(3): 205-208.

	The present studies examined the relative antagonist potencies of the optical isomers of the 5-HT receptor antagonist metitepine at the 5-HT1D binding site labelled by the novel radioligand serotonin-O-carboxymethylglycyl [125]iodotyrosinamide ([125I]GTI), and at the terminal 5-HT autoreceptor in guinea pig frontal cortex, a proposed model of 5-HT1D receptor activation. The pharmacological specificity of the [125I]GTI binding site in guinea pig frontal cortex was similar to previously published studies in the bovine cortical 5-HT1D recognition site labelled with [3H]5-HT. The (+) isomer of metitepine displaced [125I]GTI binding with a lower affinity (64 nM) than did the (-) isomer (18 nM), which was equiactive with the racemic mixture. The (-) isomer of metitepine was more effective than the (+) isomer at attenuating the inhibitory effects of 5-HT and sumatriptan at the guinea pig terminal 5-HT autoreceptor; the apparent pA2 of the (-) isomer was 8.0 (sumatriptan) and 7.7 (5-HT) while the apparent pA2 of the (+) isomer was 7.1 (sumatriptan) and 6.8 (5-HT). The (-) isomer was more effective than the (+) isomer at enhancing stimulated [3H]5-HT release. These findings support the identification of the guinea pig 5-HT terminal autoreceptor as a 5-HT1D receptor and reinforce the species homology between the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.
