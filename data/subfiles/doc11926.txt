Wright, I. K., et al. (1991). "EFFECT OF ISOLATION REARING ON 5-HT AGONIST-INDUCED RESPONSES IN THE RAT." Psychopharmacology 105(2): 259-263.

	Rats were reared from weaning (21 days of age) either in isolation or in social groups of five for 30 days and were then tested for spontaneous locomotor activity and 7 days later for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonist-induced behaviour. Isolation-reared animals displayed locomotor hyperactivity when placed in a novel environment. 5-methoxy-N,N-dimenthyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) (2 mg/kg IP) and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.32 mg/kg SC) elicited various components of the "5-HT behavioural syndrome" in both groups of animals, with forepaw treading and flat body posture being significantly more pronounced in isolation-reared animals. 1-(2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) (2.5 mg/kg IP), a 5-HT2 selective agonist, produced a significantly greater number of back muscle contractions in isolation-reared animals but there was no difference between the two groups in the number of wet-dog shakes produced. Forepaw treading and flat body posture are thought to be mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation, and stimulation of this receptor by either 5-MeODMT or 8-OH-DPAT produced greater responding in isolation-reared rats, suggesting supersensitivity of the post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor. Wet-dog shakes are thought to be mediated by 5-HT2 and other (none-5-HT) receptors while back muscle contractions have been shown to be mediated by 5-HT2 receptors, indicating that there is also an increase in 5-HT2 receptor responsiveness in the socially-isolated animals. In general, the results indicate post-synaptic 5-HT receptor supersensitivity in isolation-reared rats and these receptor changes may be involved in the behavioural profile observed in such rats.
