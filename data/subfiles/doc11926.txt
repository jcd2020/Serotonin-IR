	Serotonin (5-HT) is an important regulator of the mammalian circadian system, and has been implicated in modulating entrained and free-running rhythms, as well as photic and non-photic phase shifting. In general, 5-HT appears to oppose the actions of light on the circadian system of nocturnal rodents. As well, 5-HT mediates, at least in part, some non-photic responses. The 5-HT1A, 1B and 7 receptors regulate these acute responses to zeitgebers. 5-HT also regulates some entrained and free-running properties of the circadian clock. The receptors that contribute to these phenomena have not been fully examined. Here, we use 5-HT1A receptor knockout (KO) mice to examine the response of the mouse circadian system to a variety of lighting conditions, including a normal light-dark cycle (LD), T-cycles, phase advanced LD cycles, constant darkness (DD), constant light (LL) and a 6 hour dark pulse starting at CT5. Relative to wildtype mice, the 5-HT1A receptor KO mice have lower levels of activity during the first 8h of the night/subjective night in LD and LL, later activity onsets on transient days during re-entrainment, shorter free-running periods in LL when housed with wheels, and smaller phase shifts to dark pulses. No differences were noted in activity levels during DD, alpha under any light condition, free-running period in DD, or phase angle of entrainment in LD. While the 5-HT1A receptor plays an important role in regulating photic and non-photic phase shifting, its contribution to entrained and free-running properties of the circadian clock is relatively minor.
