	Although the neurotransmitter, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT), has been implicated as a mediator of learning and memory, the specific role of 5-HT receptors in rodents requires further delineation. In this study, 5-HT2C receptor ligands of varying relative intrinsic efficacies were tested in a mouse learning and memory model called autoshaping-operant. On day 1, mice were placed in experimental chambers and presented with a tone on a variable interval schedule. The tone remained on for 6 s or until a nose-poke response occurred to produce a dipper with Ensure solution. Mice were then injected with saline, MK212 (full agonist), m-chlorophenylpiperazine (partial agonist), mianserin, and SB206 553 (inverse agonists), and methysergide and (+)-2-bromo lysergic acid diethylamide (+)-hydrogen tartrate (neutral antagonists). Each compound was injected after either 1 or 2-h acquisition sessions on day 1 to investigate the role of acquisition session length on consolidation. Day 1 injection of the 5-HT2C inverse agonist mianserin produced greater retrieval impairments of the autoshaped operant response on day 2 than any other agent tested. Furthermore, decreasing the length of the acquisition session to 1 h significantly increased the difficulty of the autoshaping task further modulating the consolidation effects produced by the 5-HT2C ligands tested.
