Belcheva, I., et al. (1994). "Hippocampal asymmetry in the behavioral responses to the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT." Brain Res 640(1-2): 223-228.

	The present study examined the behavioral responses of rats to unilateral and bilateral injections of the selective serotonin 1A (5-HT1A)-receptor agonist 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) 1 microgram into the hippocampal CA1 area of male Wistar rats. 8-OH-DPAT increased locomotor activity, which was most pronounced with injections into the left hippocampus. The agonist impaired learning and memory (shuttle-box), especially when injected into the right hippocampus. The elevated plus-maze experiments showed that neither left nor right nor bilateral hippocampal injections of 8-OH-DPAT produced any anxiogenic effect. However, with Vogel's conflict test, right injections of 8-OH-DPAT produced anxiety. The present study has revealed hippocampal asymmetry in the behavioral responses to the 5-HT1A-receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT.
