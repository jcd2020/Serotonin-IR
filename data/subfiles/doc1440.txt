Boulenguez, P., et al. (1995). "Distractibility and locomotor activity in rat following intra-collicular injection of a serotonin 1B-1D agonist." Behav Brain Res 67(2): 229-239.

	The superior colliculus (SC) is thought to be the decision center for reactions to novel and/or moving stimuli in the peripheral visual field. Serotonin 1B (5-HT1B) receptors were previously demonstrated to be located on collicular axon terminals of retinal ganglion cells and their activation might depress afferent inputs from the retina. The effects of intra-collicular injections of 5-HT1 drugs on distractibility were studied in hooded rats trained to run toward illuminated targets for a food reward in a 2-choice runway. 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, RU 24969, a mixed 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B agonist, serotonin-O-carboxymethylglycyltyrosinamide (S-CM-GTNH2), a mixed 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor agonist and saline (control) were alternately injected. Following the S-CM-GTNH2 treatment alone, animals exhibited an erratic running style, involving side-to-side movements of the head, without change in the overall accuracy of their locomotor trajectories, but with substantial decrease in their running speed. When distracting peripheral lights were introduced at the mid-points of the animals' run, in the weaker distracting condition (unilateral distractor) only, distraction indexes were found lower following the S-CM-GTNH2 treatment than following the other drug or saline treatments. It is concluded that serotonin, via 5-HT1B-1D receptors, may induce an elevation of the visual distractibility threshold by modulating directly the transmission of the primary visual signal.
