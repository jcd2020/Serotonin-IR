	While serotonin 5HT(2)-receptors have been implicated in the etiology and pharmacological treatment of a number of neuropsychiatric conditions, there are few potent and specific agents available for use in human clinical studies. EMD 281014 is a highly specific 5HT2-receptor antagonist that is currently under development. To find optimal doses for early clinical studies, we conducted a PET study using [F-18]setoperone in nine healthy subjects scanned at baseline and following the administration of 1, 3, and 7 mg EMD 281014. The study drug was well tolerated by all study participants, and all doses resulted in greater than or equal to70% occupancy at frontal 5HT(2)-receptors 3 h after drug administration. The data suggest that daily dosing of greater than or equal to3 mg EMD 281014 should be sufficient to provide sustained high levels of 5HT(2)-receptor occupancy in future clinical trials.
