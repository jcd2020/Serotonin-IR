Barnes, J. M., et al. (1990). "Topographical distribution of 5-HT3 receptor recognition sites in the ferret brain stem." Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 342(1): 17-21.

	The distribution of [3H]zacopride (1.0 nM) to putative 5-HT3 receptor recognition sites in the ferret hindbrain was assessed using autoradiography. Specific binding (defined by the inclusion of granisetron, 1.0 microM) was heterogeneously distributed with highest density within the dorsal vagal complex (area postrema, nucleus tractus solitarius and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve). Lower densities were detected in the spinal trigeminal nerve complex whilst no other significant specific binding was detected ventral to the dorsal vagal complex. The location of 5-HT3 receptor recognition sites within the dorsal vagal complex may provide sites of action for zacopride and other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists to inhibit the emesis induced by cancer chemotherapeutic agents and x-radiation.
