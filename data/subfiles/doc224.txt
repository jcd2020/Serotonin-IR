Alonso, M. J., et al. (1995). "Microdialysis sampling to determine the pharmacokinetics of unbound SDZ ICM 567 in blood and brain in awake, freely-moving rats." Pharm Res 12(2): 291-294.

	The free concentrations of the serotoninergic 5-HT3 antagonist SDZ ICM 567 in blood and in the central nervous system were examined in awake, freely-moving rats using blood and brain microdialysis coupled to liquid chromatography. Microdialysis probes were implanted in the jugular vein and in the frontal cortex and dialysis samples were simultaneously collected from both sites. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated after a 10 mg/kg intravenous dose of [14C]SDZ ICM 567. The elimination half lives measured in whole blood, brain and blood microdialysates were similar (congruent to 1.7 h). The AUC0-5h corresponding to the unbound drug was 462 +/- 142 ng.ml-1.h in blood dialysate, not significantly different from the AUC corresponding to the free concentration in whole blood, i.e. 586 +/- 63 ng.ml-1.h. The free fraction in blood obtained in vitro by equilibrium dialysis (21%) or by microdialysis (19%) was not statistically different from that obtained in vivo (17%) in microdialysis experiments. The unbound concentrations (AUC0-5h) of SDZ ICM 567 in the brain cortex were 86 +/- 24 ng.ml-1.h, lower than those expected from unbound blood concentrations, suggesting an active transport out of the central nervous system. Finally, microdialysis sampling allowed the determination of pharmacokinetic parameters of SDZ ICM 567 in blood and brain as well as the estimation of the free fraction of drug in blood.
