Mijnster, M. J., et al. (1998). "Effects of risperidone and haloperidol on tachykinin and opioid precursor peptide mRNA levels in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens of the rat." Synapse 28(4): 302-312.

	We investigated whether the two output pathways of the striatum are differently affected by the novel atypical drug risperidone and the conventional typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol. To this end, changes in mRNA levels of preproenkephalin-A, preproenkephalin-B, and preprotachykinin were determined in the rat striatum following chronic drug treatment for 14 days, using quantitative in situ hybridization. Furthermore, we studied the contribution of the dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A antagonist components of risperidone in establishing its effects on neuropeptide mRNA levels in the striatum. The results showed that both risperidone and haloperidol had major effects on the preproenkephalin-A mRNA and thus on the indirect striatal output route, whereas they had minor effects on preproenkephalin-B and preprotachykinin mRNA, contained by the direct output route. When both drugs were administered in the same dose, preproenkephalin-A mRNA was much more elevated by haloperidol than by risperidone. However, when doses of risperidone and haloperidol were modified to attain comparable dopamine D2 receptor occupancy, the drugs had comparable effects on preproenkephalin-A mRNA levels. It was further found that 5-HT2A/C receptor blockade with ritanserin had only modest effects on preproenkephalin-B and preprotachykinin mRNA levels and did not affect preproenkephalin-A mRNA levels. We conclude that risperidone and haloperidol, administered in the same dose, differently affect the striatal output routes. Furthermore, the results suggest that the effects of risperidone on neuropeptide mRNA levels are fully accounted for by its D2 antagonism and that no indication exists for a role of 5-HT2A receptor blockade in this action.
