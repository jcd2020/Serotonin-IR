Popova, N. K., et al. (1994). "CONTRIBUTION OF 5-HT1A SEROTONIN RECEPTORS OF THE BRAIN TO THE REGULATION OF HEREDITARY CATALEPSY." Bull Exp Biol Med 118(12): 1324-1327.

	Selective agonists 5-HT1A of serotonin receptors (8-OH-DPAT and flezinoxan) had an inhibitory effect on the manifestation of hereditary catalepsy in mice and rats. No differences were revealed in specific binding of H-3-8-OH-DPAT to 5-HT1A receptors in the striatum of either cataleptic or noncataleptic mice and rats. Nonetheless, an increase of the density of these receptors was observed in the frontal cortex of CBA mice predisposed to catalepsy in comparison with mice of the noncataleptic C57B1 strain. The data indicate a contribution of 5-HT1A receptors to the regulation of hereditary catalepsy.
