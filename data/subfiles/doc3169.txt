	This study was designed to examine an anxiety-like behavior in the adult gonadectomized (GDX) male rats subjected to testosterone propionate (TP) treatment alone or in combination with 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, or with NAN-190, 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. Two weeks after gonadectomy, GDX rats were subjected by treatments with the solvent, TP (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.), 8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.), NAN-190 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), TP in combination with 8-OH-DPAT or NAN-190 during 14 days. Anxiety behavior was assessed in the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the open field test (OFT). 8-OH-DPAT treatment failed to modify the anxiety-like behavior of GDX rats in the EPM as compared to the GDX rats given with oil solvent. NAN-190 injected alone or in combination with TP to GDX rats resulted in a significant anxiolytic-like effect as compared to the GDX given with oil solvent or TP application. Our data indicate that the combination of NAN-190 and TP is more effective than TP alone in GDX rats inducing a more profound anxiolytic-like effect in the EPM. Thus, the results of this study suggest that effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonist/antagonist can modify anxiety level in opposite direction in male rats after gonadectomy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.
