	Studies in animals and in healthy volunteers have demonstrated the central serotonergic analgesic mechanism of action of paracetamol involving the inhibition of this analgesia by tropisetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist. This randomized, double-blind, controlled study aims at studying this interaction in post-operative patients after ear surgery. Thirty-six patients are included in two parallel groups with intravenous paracetamol (1 g) and either tropisetron (T, 5 mg/mL) or placebo (c, NaCl 0.9%) administered at the end of surgery. Numerical pain evaluations are performed every 30 min, six times after awakening. The difference between the sums of numerical scales of both groups [9 +/- 10 (T) vs. 6 +/- 7 (c)] is not significant, but the tropisetron group displays higher pain scores despite additional rescue analgesia. The limits of this trial call for a much larger study to investigate further this pharmacodynamic interaction.
