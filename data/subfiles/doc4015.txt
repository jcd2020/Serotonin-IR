Grimes, J. M. and R. H. Melloni (2005). "Serotonin-1B receptor activity and expression modulate the aggression-stimulating effects of adolescent anabolic steroid exposure in hamsters." Behavioral Neuroscience 119(5): 1184-1194.

	high dose (5.0 mg/kg) anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) exposure during adolescence stimulates offensive aggression in male Syrian hamsters. These studies examined whether AAS-induced aggression was regulated by the activity of serotonin (5HT) type-1B receptors and correlated with altered 5HT1B expression. AAS-treated hamsters were tested for offensive aggression following the administration of the 5HT1B agonist anpirtoline (0.125-0.5 mg/kg). Anpirtoline dose-dependently reduced select components of the AAS-induced aggressive response, with significant reductions observed at 0.25 mg/kg. Aggressive, AAS-treated hamsters showed significant decreases in the area covered by 5HT1B-containing neuronal puncta and increases in the number of 5HT1B-containing neuronal somata in select brain regions implicated in aggression control. Together, these data support a role for site-specific alterations in 5HT1B signaling and expression in adolescent AAS-induced aggression.
