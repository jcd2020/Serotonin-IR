	Brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) systems contribute to regulate eating behavior and energy homeostasis. 5-HT2C receptors and 5-HT1B receptors have been shown to mediate anorexic effects of 5-HT drugs such as D-feriflurdmine, which stimulates 5-HT release and inhibits 5-HT reuptake, and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a 5-HT2C receptor agonist. Here, we report that 24-h fasting increased the expression of hypothalamic 5-HT2C receptor and 5-HT1B receptor genes in association with increases in plasma active ghrelin levels compared with fed state in mice. Treatment with mCPP or fenflurainine significantly inhibited the increases in plasma active ghrelin levels. mCPP or fenfluramine significantly increased the expression of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript genes while having no significant effects on the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptide Y, agouti-related protein, and ghrelin genes. These results suggest that there is a negative feedback system between brain 5-HT systems and plasma active ghrelin levels in energy homeostasis in mice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
