Jolas, T., et al. (1993). "(-)Tertatolol is a potent antagonist at pre- and postsynaptic serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in the rat brain." Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 347(5): 453-463.

	The potential 5-HT1A antagonist properties of the beta-antagonist tertatolol were assessed using biochemical and electrophysiological assays in the rat. (+/-) Tertatolol bound with high affinity (Ki = 38 nM) to 5-HT1A sites labelled by [3H]8-OH-DPAT in hippocampal membranes. The (-)stereoisomer (Ki = 18 nM) was about 50-fold more potent than the (+)stereoisomer (Ki = 864 nM) to inhibit the specific binding of [3H]-8-OH-DPAT. As expected of a 5-HT1A antagonist, (-)tertatolol prevented in a concentration-dependent manner (Ki = 24 nM) the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal homogenates. Furthermore in vivo pretreatment with (-)tertatolol (5 mg/kg s.c.) significantly reduced the inhibitory influence of 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) on the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan in various brain areas after the blockade of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase by NSD-1015 (100 mg/kg i.p.). In vitro (in brainstem slices; Ki approximately 50 nM) and in vivo (in chloral hydrate anaesthetized rats; ID50 approximately 0.40 mg/kg i.v.), (-)tertatolol prevented the inhibitory effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT, ipsapirone and lesopitron on the firing rate of serotoninergic neurones within the dorsal raphe nucleus. In about 25% of these neurones, the basal firing rate was significantly increased by (-)tertatolol (up to +47% in vitro, and +30% in vivo). These data indicate that (-)tertatolol is a potent competitive antagonist at both pre (in the dorsal raphe nucleus)-and post (in the hippocampus)-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the rat brain.
