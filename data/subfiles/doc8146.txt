Maswood, N. and L. Uphouse (1997). "A single pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT reduces behavioral indices of serotonin 1A receptor activation in ovariectomized rats." Neuropharmacology 36(11-12): 1725-1732.

	The effects of prior treatment with 8-OH-DPAT on 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating behavior, hypothermia, flat body posture and forepaw treading were examined in ovariectomized rats. Twenty-four hours after a single pretreatment with 0.25 mg/kg of the drug, the eating behavior and flat body posture induced by 8-OH-DPAT were reduced relative to that seen following the first treatment with the drug. In contrast, within 24 hr of the prior drug treatment, the drug's effects on forepaw treading and rectal temperature were unchanged. However, 7 days after prior treatment with 8-OH-DPAT, eating behavior, flat body posture and hypothermia induced by the drug were suppressed. Only forepaw treading remained unchanged. These findings are discussed in reference to similar studies of 5-HT1A receptor agonist-induced modulation of behaviors in male rats. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
