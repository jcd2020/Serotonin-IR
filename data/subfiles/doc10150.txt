Piercey, M. F., et al. (1996). "Pharmacology of U-91356A, an agonist for the dopamine D2 receptor subtype." Eur J Pharmacol 317(1): 29-38.

	U-91356A [(R)-5,6-dihydro-5-(propylamino)4H-imidazo[4,5,1-ij]quinolin -2-(1H)-one, monohydrochloride], bound with highest affinity to the dopamine D2 receptor subtype, although it also bound with somewhat lower affinities to the dopamine D3 and D4, as well as the 5-HT1A receptor subtypes. In addition to depressing dopamine synthesis and turnover, injection of U-91356A increased striatal acetylcholine concentrations. U-91356A also depressed firing rates of dopamine neurons. In mice, this compound stimulated cage climbing and locomotor activity in reserpinized animals; it also antagonized D-amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity. It produced contralateral turning in rats with unilateral lesions of the substantia nigra. These data are consistent with roles for the dopamine D2 receptor subtype as a dopamine autoreceptor and as a stimulatory, postsynaptic dopamine receptor.
