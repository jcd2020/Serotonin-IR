	The aim of our work is to investigate the potential involvement of serotonin and its G-protein-coupled receptors in neural differentiation or other developmental processes in Xenopus laevis. By using a RT-PCR strategy, we isolated a cDNA fragment from X. laevis brain showing high amino-acid similarity with the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor. We used this fragment to isolate a cDNA clone containing a single ORF of 408 amino-acids with an overall amino-acid identity of 73% with the human and rat 5-HT1A receptor. This structural similarity suggests that this clone encodes the Xenopus homolog of the mammalian 5-HT1A receptor (X5-HT1A). In order to establish a possible role for this receptor in development, we analyzed the pattern of its gene expression during embryogenesis, larval stages and in adult brain by in situ hybridization. The first signal of mRNA expression appears in the rostral part of brain stem at stage 22, when the first neurons start differentiation [38,21]. In later stages of development, the cells expressing X5-HT1A transcripts appear to correspond to serotonergic neurons. By stage 41, X5-HT1A mRNA is also detected in the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the developing retina. This pattern of expression is maintained until stage 46, i.e. at the beginning of metamorphosis. In adult, additional brain areas express X5-HT1A mRNA, particularly in telencephalon, diencephalon and mesencephalon. On the whole, our data show that the X5-HT1A receptor mRNA is developmentally regulated, with expression first appearing in differentiating serotonergic neurons, where this receptor may mediate, through an autocrine regulatory pathway, the trophic action of serotonin on developing serotonergic system.
