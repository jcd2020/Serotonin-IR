	A focused SAR study around the previously reported selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist, SB-269970-A has resulted in the identification of a structurally related analogue having an improved pharmacokinetic profile. Replacement of the phenolic group in SB-269970-A with an indole moiety, and replacement of the piperidinyl 4-methyl group with a heterocyclic ring system proved to be the key changes leading to the identification of SB-656104-A.
