Newman, M. E., et al. (1992). "PLATELET ADENYLATE-CYCLASE ACTIVITY IN DEPRESSION AND AFTER CLOMIPRAMINE AND LITHIUM TREATMENT - RELATION TO SEROTONERGIC FUNCTION." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 109(1-2): 231-234.

	Adenylate cyclase activity was measured in platelet membranes from 10 healthy controls, 12 depressed patients, and the same patients after treatment with clomipramine (CMI) followed by lithium carbonate (Li) supplementation, in an attempt to determine whether any evidence for an effect on the serotonergic system could be obtained in peripheral cells. There were no differences in basal, NaF-, PGE1-, or forskolin-stimulated activity either between the control subjects and depressed patients or between activities in the patients measured before treatment, after CMI, and after CMI + Li. The degree of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 5-HT, an effect putatively mediated by a 5-HT1A-like receptor, was not different in the depressed patients compared to controls or affected by CMI treatment, but was significantly reduced after Li supplementation.
