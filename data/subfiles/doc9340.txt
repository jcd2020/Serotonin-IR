Reiser, G., et al. (1988). "Memantine (1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane) blocks the serotonin-induced depolarization response in a neuronal cell line." Brain Res 443(1-2): 338-344.

	The influence of memantine on several properties of a neuronal cell line was tested. The aim was to get some insight into possible mechanisms of action of this drug which is therapeutically applicable in treatment of spasticity, Parkinson's disease, and cerebral coma. In neuroblastoma X glioma hybrid cells, memantine, at micromolar concentrations, blocked the depolarization induced by iontophoretically applied serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT). In the hybrid cells, receptors of the 5-HT3 type mediated the depolarization, which was frequently accompanied by a series of action potentials. The inhibition by memantine of the serotonin response occurred fast and was completely reversible, irrespective of whether the cell showed a stable membrane potential or spontaneous action potentials. However, memantine did not alter spontaneous or electrically evoked action potential activity in the hybrid cells, and apparently did not block the underlying ionic conductances. Furthermore memantine did not affect either the cation permeability activated by substance P in the hybrid cells or the K+ channel triggered by bradykinin in a glioma cell line. Thus, memantine appears specifically to suppress the ion channel opened by serotonin in the hybrid cells. The interaction of memantine with serotonin receptors and the associated ion channels reported here, might give an important clue, as to a site of action of memantine in the nervous system.
