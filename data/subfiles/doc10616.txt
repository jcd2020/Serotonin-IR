	The present work describes a series of experiments designed to examine the possible role of central 5-HT circuits in the control of feeding and drinking in pigeons. Acute effects (within 1 h) of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections of 5-HT (0, 9.7, 19.4, 38.7, 77.5, 155, and 310 nmol) in 24-h food-deprived (24FD) pigeons included strong hypophagic and dipsogenic responses at the three higher doses. Total food intake and the duration of feeding behavior were reduced, and latency for the start of eating increased. Total l-h water intake in B-HT-treated pigeons usually increases to reach a volume equivalent to 10% of their body weight. Similarly, potent dipsogenic effects of ICV 5-HT, but no food intake decreases, were observed in food-satiated animals. Feeding behavior induced by ICV injection of adrenaline (30 nmol) in satiated pigeons was abolished by previous (20 min before) ICV 5-HT (155 nmol) injections. Catecholamine treatment did not affected the dipsogenic effect of 5-HT injections, Decreases in food intake were similarly observed after ICV or subcutaneous injections of equimolar 5-HT doses (155 nmol) in 24FD pigeons, but systemic 5-HT injections evoked no drinking behavior, Central injections of the 5-HT2a/2c agonist DOI (56 nmol) induced similar decreases in duration and amount of food intake in 24FD animals. No dipsogenic effect was observed with either DOI doses. In 24FD pigeons, the 5-HT1a agonist 8-OH-DPAT (30.5 nmol) induced strong dipsogenic effects, as well as increase in food intake duration, These data may indicate an involvement of 5-HT circuits in food intake as well as in water intake control systems in the pigeon, and that serotoninergic effects in these functional domains are mediated by independent mechanisms.
