	Recent studies revealed a role for dopamine and noradrenaline in the etiology of ischemia-induced neuronal cell death. In the present investigation, the modulation by clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic agent that interacts with adrenergic receptors, of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex-mediated events were studied by examining its effects on levels of cGMP in the cerebellum. Clozapine decreased basal levels of cGMP in the cerebellum and antagonized harmaline-, methamphetamine-, pentylenetetrazol- and D-serine-induced increases in levels of cGMP with ED50 values of 3.9, 2.36, 2.13 and 2.1 mg/kg (i.p.). However, clozapine (1.25-25 mg/kg) did not attenuate the quisqualate-induced increases in levels of cGMP, indicating a specific modulation of events modulated by the NMDA receptor complex. Antagonists of dopamine (D2), serotonin (5-HT)-5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 [haloperidol, propranolol, ritanserin, ICS 205-930 [(3-tropanyl-indole-3-carboxylate methiodide)] respectively], did not reverse the response to harmaline. However, WB-4101 [(2,6-dimethoxy-phenoxyethyl)aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane HCl], and alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, reversed harmaline-, D-serine-, PTZ- and MA-induced increases in levels of cGMP, indicating an adrenergic modulation of the events mediated by the NMDA receptor complex. Intracerebellar and intracerebroventricular administration of clozapine and intracerebellar administration of WB-4101 reversed the D-serine-induced response, indicating a central locus of action. These results indicated that clozapine modulates levels of cGMP predominantly through its interactions with central adrenergic receptors.
