	Identification of mechanisms that regulate the number of synapses in the brain has been a key issue for understanding the mechanism of plasticity. Here, we report that the density of synapses can be changed using an antagonist and/or an agonist of serotonin (5-HT) type 2A receptors in the chicken spinal cord. Because of the widespread distribution pattern of 5-HT fibers and 5-HT2A receptors in the central nervous system, 5-HT is thought to play a role in the formation and maintenance of synapses that are involved in normal brain function and mechanism of plasticity.
