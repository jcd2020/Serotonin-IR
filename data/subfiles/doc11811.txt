	This study introduces the Microtaxic Ventricular Injector, a plastic mold that allows for the rapid administration of drugs into the ventricular system of adult rats. The Microtaxic Ventricular Injector was used to destroy serotonin (5-HT) neurons by administering the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; 100 micrograms/10 microliters) into the lateral cerebroventricles. Injection of the 5-HT neurotoxin produced a 79% depletion of 5-HT in the cortex and an 86% depletion of 5-HT in the hippocampus. In addition, 5,7-DHT treatment produced a two-fold shift to the left of the dose-response curve of the 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) or 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) in producing the 5-HT syndrome indicating the development of denervation supersensitivity following the destruction of 5-HT neurons. In addition, the behavioral effects of 8-OH-DPAT were studied when administered to different CNS sites using the Microtaxic Ventricular Injector. 8-OH-DPAT (10 micrograms) injected into the fourth ventricle produced the 5-HT syndrome in 100% of the rats tested within a 3 min time period. In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT injected into the lateral ventricle produced the syndrome in only 33% of the rats tested and with a 6-9 min delay until this effect occurred. These results indicate the greater potency of 8-OH-DPAT at producing the 5-HT syndrome when administered in ventricular sites that are close to its locus of action in the brainstem/spinal cord region. These experiments demonstrate the usefulness and reliability of the Microtaxic Ventricular Injector as an instrument for rapidly injecting drugs directly into different cerebroventricular sites.
