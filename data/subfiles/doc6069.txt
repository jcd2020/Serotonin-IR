	The potential role of serotonin (5-HT) in cardiac function has generated much interest in recent years. In particular, the need for a tight regulation of 5-HT to maintain normal cardiovascular activity has been demonstrated in different experimental models. However, it remains unclear how increased levels of 5-HT could contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy. Availability of 5-HT depends on the mitochondrial enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). Therefore, we investigated the consequences of MAO-A deletion on ventricular remodeling in the model of aortic banding in mice. At baseline, MAO-A deletion was associated with an increase in whole blood 5-HT (39.4 +/- 1.9 mu M vs. 24.0 +/- 0.9 mu M in KO and WT mice, respectively). Cardiac 5-HT2A, but not 5-HT2B receptors were overexpressed in MAO-A KO mice, as demonstrated by real-time PCR and Western-blot experiments. After aortic banding, MAO-A KO mice demonstrated greater increase in heart wall thickness, heart to body weight ratios, cardiomyocyte crosssection areas, and myocardial fibrosis compared to WT. Exacerbation of hypertrophy in KO mice was associated with increased amounts of 5-HT in the heart. In order to determine the role of 5-HT and 5-HT2A receptors in ventricular remodeling in MAO-A KO mice, we administered the 5-HT2A receptor antagonists ketanserin (1 mg/kg/day) or M100907 (0.1 mg/kg/day) during 4 weeks of aortic banding. Chronic administration of these antagonists strongly prevented exacerbation of ventricular hypertrophy in MAO-A KO mice. These results show for the first time that regulation of peripheral 5-HT by MAO-A plays a role in ventricular remodeling via activation of 5-HT2A receptors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
