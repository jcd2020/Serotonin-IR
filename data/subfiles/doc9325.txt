	1 RS-15385-197, a highly potent and selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, was examined in a variety of in vitro and in vivo functional tests to assess the selectivity of its interaction with central noradrenergic neurones in the rat. 2 In hypothalamic slices, RS-15385-197 was potent in augmenting K+-evoked release of [H-3]-noradrenaline, with an EC50 of 9 nm. Idazoxan and yohimbine showed 100 fold less activity. This was due to its antagonist action at presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors, as RS-15385-197 (10 muM), did not directly release [H-3]-noradrenaline from cortical slices unlike reserpine (10 muM), and did not inhibit noradrenaline re-uptake into cortical synaptosomes. 3 In vivo, RS-15385-197 (0.5 mg kg-1, p.o.) increased levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol (MHPG) in the cerebral cortex without modifying levels of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). This dose, but not a lower dose (0.1 mg kg-1, p.o.) caused beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation in the cortex when administered once daily for 14 days whereas 5-HT2 receptor number was unaltered, indicating a selective effect on noradrenergic transmission. 4 Selective depletion of cortical 5-HT by administration of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA; 100 mg kg-1, i.p. for 14 days) or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT; 150 mug i.c.v.) prevented the beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation caused by RS-15385-197, indicating that a tonic 5-hydroxytryptaminergic input was required for it to elicit beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation. It was not possible to prevent the loss of activity of RS-15385-197 in these 5-HT-depleted animals by co-administration with the 5-HT1A partial agonist, 8-hydroxy-n-dipropyl aminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.3 mg kg-1, i.p. twice daily for final 3 days). 5 At a dose (1 mg kg-1, p,o.) which completely prevented the hypoactivity produced by clonidine (0.1 mg kg-1, p.o.), RS-15385-197 did not affect behavioural stereotypy induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg kg-1, s.c.). Similarly, following chronic dosing with the racemate, RS-15385-196 (3 mg kg-1, p.o., once daily for 14 days), there was no effect on the behavioural and hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT (0,5 mg kg-1, s.c.). Therefore, RS-15385-197 was selective for central alpha2-adrenoceptors over 5-HT1A receptors in in vivo functional tests. 6 Thus, RS-15385-197 was highly selective in interacting with central noradrenergic neurones in the rat in vitro and in vivo. It is therefore currently the agent of choice for investigations of the role of alpha2-adrenoceptors in the CNS.
