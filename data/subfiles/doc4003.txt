	1 The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitor citalopram (10 and 20 mg kg(-1), i.p.) significantly reduced food intake in male rats (CD-COBS) habituated to eat their daily food during a 4-h period. 2 The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (0.3 mg kg(-1)) administered systemically did not modify feeding but significantly potentiated the reduction in food intake caused by 10 mg kg(-1) i.p. citalopram. The dose of 5 mg kg(-1) i.p. citalopram was not active in animals pretreated with vehicle but significantly reduced feeding in animals pretreated with WAY100635. 3 WAY100635 (0.1 mu g 0.5 mu l(-1)) injected into the dorsal raphe significantly potentiated the hypophagic effect of 10 mg kg(-1) citalopram. 4 WAY100635 (1.0 mu g 0.5 mu l(-1)) injected into the median raphe did not modify feeding or the hypophagic effect of 10 mg kg(-1) citalopram. 5 The 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonist SB206553 (10 mg kg(-1), p.o.) slightly reduced feeding by itself but partially antagonized the effect of WAY100635 administered systemically (0.3 mg kg(-1), s.c.) or into the dorsal raphe (0.1 mu g 0.5 mu l(-1)) in combination with 10 mg kg(-1) i.p. citalopram. The hypophagic effect of 10 mg kg(-1) i.p. citalopram alone was not significantly modified by SB206553. 6 Brain concentrations of citalopram and its metabolite desmethylcitalopram in rats pretreated with SB206553, WAY100635 and their combination were comparable to those of vehicle-pretreated rats, 90 min after citalopram injection. 7 The hypophagic effect of citalopram was potentiated by blocking 5-HT1A receptors. Only the effect of the WAY100635/citalopram combination seemed to be partially mediated by central 5-HT2C receptors.
