Chernet, E., et al. (2005). "Use of LC/MS to assess brain tracer distribution in preclinical, in vivo receptor occupancy studies: Dopamine D2, serotonin 2A and NK-1 receptors as examples." Life Sciences 78(4): 340-346.

	High performance liquid chromatography combined with either single quad or triple quad mass spectral detectors (LC/MS) was used to measure the brain distribution of receptor occupancy tracers targeting dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A and neurokinin NK-1 receptors using the ligands raclopride, MDL-100907 and GR205171, respectively. All three non-radiolabeled tracer molecules were easily detectable in discrete rat brain areas after intravenous doses of 3, 3 and 30 mu g/kg, respectively. These levels showed a differential brain distribution caused by differences in receptor density, as demonstrated by the observation that pretreatment with compounds that occupy these receptors reduced this differential distribution in a dose-dependent manner. Intravenous, subcutaneous and oral dose-occupancy curves were generated for haloperidol at the dopamine D2 receptor as were oral curves for the antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and clozapine. In vivo dose-occupancy curves were also generated for orally administered clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol at the cortical 5-HT2A binding site. In vivo occupancy at the striatal neurokinin NK-1 binding site by various doses of orally administered MK-869 was also measured. Our results demonstrate the utility of LC/MS to quantify tracer distribution in preclinical brain receptor occupancy studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
