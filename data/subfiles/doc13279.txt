Wainscott, D. B., et al. (2005). "H-3 LY334370, a novel radioligand for the 5-HT1F receptor. I. In vitro characterization of binding properties." Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archives of Pharmacology 371(3): 169-177.

	[H-3] LY334370 was developed as a radioligand to study the characteristics of this compound's interaction with the 5-HT1F receptor. Monovalent or divalent cations did not enhance the binding of [H-3] LY334370 to the cloned human 5-HT1F receptor. In the presence of MgCl2, the time to reach equilibrium was approximately 2 h, while in its absence equilibrium was reached in less than 1 h. [H-3] LY334370 had high affinity for the cloned human 5-HT1F receptor (K-d = 0.446 nM) and the 5-HT1F receptor in rat brain (K-d = 0.388 nM). The expression density of 5-HT1F receptors, as determined by binding to homogenates of cortical regions from rat, was low (B-max = 79.1 fmol/ mg protein). There was a statistically significant correlation between the apparent pK(i) for inhibition of [H-3] LY334370 binding and the pEC(50) for stimulation of [S-35] GTP gamma S binding to homogenates of cells expressing the cloned human 5- HT1F receptor. In addition, there was a statistically significant correlation between the apparent pK(i) for inhibition of [H-3] LY334370 binding to the cloned human 5-HT1F receptor and the pID(50) for inhibition of trigeminal nerve stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the guinea pig. The conclusion from these studies is that [H-3] LY334370 is a high affinity radioligand which can be used for the study of the 5-HT1F receptor in rat brain or in cells transformed with the human 5-HT1F receptor.
