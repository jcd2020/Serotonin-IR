	Although many studies has been shown that serotonin (5-HT) in the preoptic area and anterior hypothalamus (PO/AH) is important for regulating body temperature (Tb), the exact role is not established yet due to conflicting results probably related to experimental techniques or conditions such as the use of anesthesia. The purpose of present study was to clarify the role of 5-HT in the PO/AH using the combined methods of telemetry, microdialysis and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), with a special emphasis on the regulation of Tb in freely moving rats. Firstly, we measured changes in Tb and levels of extracellular 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the PO/AH during cold (5 degrees C) and heat (35 degrees C) exposure. We also perfused fluoxetine (5-HT re-uptake inhibitor) and 8-hydroxy-2-(Di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT: 5-HT1A agonist) into the PO/AH. During both exposures, although Tb changed significantly, no significant changes were noted in extracellular levels of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the PO/AH. In addition, although perfusion of fluoxetine or 8-OH-DPAT into the PO/AH increased or decreased extracellular 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the PO/AH respectively, but Tb did not change at all. Our results suggest that 5-HT in the PO/AH may not mediate acute changes in thermoregulation.
