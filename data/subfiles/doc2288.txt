	Drugs that alter brain serotonin (5-HT) function can modulate the behavioral effects of cocaine, but the underlying receptor mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study examined the effects of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.01-0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) on cocaine self-administration in the context of a choice procedure. Five adult male cynomolgus monkeys self-administered cocaine (saline, 0.003-0.03 mg/kg per injection) under a concurrent fixed-ratio 50 schedule of food (1-g banana-flavored pellets) and cocaine presentation. Allocation of responses to the cocaine-associated lever (cocaine choice) increased in a dose-related manner from <= 20% of total responses when saline or 0.003 mg/kg per injection cocaine was the alternative to food to >= 75% when 0.03 mg/kg per injection cocaine was available. In four of five monkeys, when choice was between a low cocaine dose and food, 0.01 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT increased injection-lever responding. At cocaine doses which occasioned : 75% cocaine choice, 8-OH-DPAT did not alter response allocation. In the fifth monkey, 8-OH-DPAT only decreased injection-lever responding. When choice was between saline and food, S-OH-DPAT did not reliably shift responding to the injection lever, except at doses that disrupted operant performance. These results suggest that a 5-HT1A receptor agonist can increase the reinforcing strength of a low cocaine dose relative to a concurrently available non-drug reinforcer.
