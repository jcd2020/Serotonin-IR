	Aripiprazole is the first approved atypical antipsychotic with a mechanism of action that exerts a partial agonism with high affinity at Dopamin D2- and Serotonin-5-HT1A-receptors as well as an antagonism at Serotonin-5-HT2A-receptors. Aripiprazole provides good clinical effectiveness and a favorable profile of safety and tolerability. The special pharmacodynamics of aripiprazole are described herein.
