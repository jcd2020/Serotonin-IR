	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with neuronal degeneration, synaptic loss and deficits in multiple neurotransmitter systems. Alterations in the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor can contribute to impaired cognitive function in AD, and both in vitro binding and Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies have demonstrated that 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus/medial temporal cortex are affected early in AD. This neuropathological study examined the localization and immunoreaction intensity of 5-HT1A receptor protein in AD hippocampus with the goal to determine whether neuronal receptor levels are influenced by the severity of NFT severity defined by Braaks' pathological staging and to provide immunohistochemical confirmation of the binding assays and PET imaging studies. Subjects included AD patients and non-AD controls (NC) stratified into three Braaks' stages (Braak 0-II, NC; Braak III/IV and V/VI, AD). In the Braak 0-II group, 5-HT1A-immunoreactivity (ir) was prominent in the neuropil of the CA1 and subiculum, moderate in the dentate gyrus molecular layer (DGml), and low in the CA3 and CA4. No changes in 5-HT1A-ir were observed in the hippocampus of AD subjects in the Braak III/IV group. Hippocampal 5-HT1A-ir intensity was markedly decreased in the CA1 region in 6/11 (54.5%) subjects in the Braak V/VI group. Across all three groups combined, there was a statistically significant association between reduced 5HT1A-ir and neuronal loss in the CA1, but not in the CA3. The present data demonstrate that hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors are mainly preserved until the end-stage of NFT progression in AD. Thus, the utility of PET imaging using a 5-HT1A-specific radiolabeled probe as a marker of hippocampal neuronal loss may be limited to the CA1 field in advanced stage AD cases.
