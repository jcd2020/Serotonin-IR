Wang, T. and M. J. Brown (2001). "Influence of beta(1)-adrenoceptor blockade on the gene expression of adenylate cyclase subtypes and beta-adrenoceptor kinase in human atrium." Clinical Science 101(3): 211-217.

	There is accumulating evidence of cross-regulation between stimulatory G-protein (G(s))-coupled receptors in human atrium. Chronic beta (1)-adrenoceptor antagonist treatment can sensitize beta (2)-adrenoreceptors, 5-HT4 receptors, histamine H-2 receptors and possibly beta (4)-adrenoreceptors. To investigate the mechanism of such cross-talk between G(s)-coupled receptors, we have measured the mRNA expression of the cardiac adenylate cyclases (types IV, V, VI and VII) and of beta -adrenoceptor kinase I in human atria using TaqMan quantitative PCR, and compared expression between patients chronically receiving a beta (1)-adrenoceptor antagonist and nontreated patients. The results showed no difference in gene expression between the two groups of patients; however, significant positive correlations of gene expression between adenylate cyclase subtypes were found. We conclude that beta (1)-adrenoceptor antagonists do not change the absolute levels of gene expression of adenylate cyclase subtypes in human atrium. The co-ordinate regulation among adenylate cyclase subtypes and the influence of beta (1)-adrenoceptor antagonists need to be investigated further.
