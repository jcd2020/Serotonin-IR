	Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) bind directly to various neurotransmitter receptors. The clinical effects of SSRIs appear gradually during weeks of treatment, suggesting a role for adaptive changes in neurotransmitter receptors. Most clinically used antidepressants, e.g. fluoxetine, bind to 5-HT2C receptors. When administered chronically, many antidepressants elicit adaptive regulation of 5-HT2C receptors. The present study was conducted in order to determine the effects of acute and chronic fluoxetine and citalopram treatments on the density and function of 5-HT2C receptors in the rat choroid plexus. Acute and chronic treatments followed by phosphomositide (PI) hydrolysis assays and quantitative receptor autoradiography were performed. Acute (single-dose) treatment with neither drug significantly affected basal or 5-HT-stimulated PI hydrolysis, but acute citalopram (20 mg/kg) treatment increased both agonist and antagonist binding to 5-HT2C receptors. Chronic (14 days) citaloprain treatment (20 mg/kg) increased the maximal PI hydrolysis response by 40%, but fluoxetine lacked this effect. The present data suggest that sensitisation of 5-HT2C receptor-mediated intracellular signal transduction may play a role in the effects of citalopram. In contrast, fluoxetine treatment does not functionally sensitise 5-HT2C receptors. Thus, functional 5-HT2C receptor sensitisation is not a common effect of antidepressants, but the differential effects may explain some of the pharmacodynamic differences seen with these drugs, especially upon repeated administration.
