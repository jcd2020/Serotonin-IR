Boers, P. M., et al. (2004). "Naratriptan has a selective inhibitory effect on trigeminovascular neurones at central 5-HT1A and 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors in the cat: implications for migraine therapy." Cephalalgia 24(2): 99-109.

	The triptans are agonists at serotonin (5-HT)1B/1D receptors; however, they are also active at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1F receptors. We conducted this series of experiments to further elucidate the site of action of naratriptan using a well-established animal model of trigeminovascular stimulation. Following electrical stimulation of the superior sagittal sinus of the cat, single cell responses (n=83) were recorded in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Most cells (91%) also responded to electrical and mechanical stimulation of cutaneous or mucosal facial receptive fields. The microiontophoretic application of naratriptan resulted in a significant suppression of the response to sagittal sinus stimulation (response suppressed by 47 +/- 4%, P<0.001). The effect of naratriptan was significantly attenuated by application of either the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist GR-127935 (P<0.001) or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (P<0.05). The response of single cells to receptive field stimulation was also suppressed by microiontophoretic application of naratriptan, but by only 20 +/- 3%. Intravenous administration of naratriptan resulted in a similar selective suppression of sagittal sinus vs. receptive field responses in trigeminal neurones. These results indicate that naratriptan has a central effect in the trigeminovascular system, selectively inhibiting afferent activity in craniovascular neurones, via both 5-HT(1B/1D) and 5-HT1A receptors.
