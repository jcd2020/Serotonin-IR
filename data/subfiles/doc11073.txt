Roychowdhury, S., et al. (1994). "5-HT1A and 5-HT4 receptor colocalization on hippocampal pyramidal cells." Neuropharmacology 33(3-4): 551-557.

	The mixed inhibitory and excitatory effects of 5-HT on hippocampal pyramidal cells were studied on hippocampal slices perfused with a low-Ca2+/high Mg2+ solution that blocked synaptic activity and induced spontaneous pyramidal cell discharge. Extracellular recordings of the spontaneous discharge revealed that, in 65% of the cells, 5-HT (0.5-10 microM) initially inhibited and then, upon washout, facilitated spontaneous discharge. Sometimes the off-stimulation persisted for the duration of the experiment. In 17% of the cells the response to 5-HT was only stimulatory, and in 15% the response was exclusively inhibitory. The 5-HT1 agonists, 8-hydroxy-dipropylamino-tetraline, and 5-carboxamidotryptamine produced inhibition with no excitatory responses upon washout. The inhibition was blocked by spiroxatrine indicating it was mediated by 5-HT1A receptors. The 5-HT3 agonist, 2-methyl 5-HT, had no effect, and the 5-HT2 antagonist, ketanserin, did not alter the excitatory responses to 5-HT. This indicates the excitatory response is not mediated by 5-HT2 or 3 receptors. Cisapride, a 5-HT4 agonist increased pyramidal cell discharge. The 5-HT3 & 4 antagonist, ICS 205-930 antagonized the excitatory responses to 5-HT, alpha-methyl 5-HT, and cisapride, indicating the excitatory response is mediated, in part, by 5-HT4 receptors. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutyl-methyl-xanthine, stimulated pyramidal cell discharge and potentiated the response to cisapride. This further suggests 5-HT4 receptor involvement since these receptors are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase.
