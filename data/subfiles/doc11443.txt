Varty, G. B. and G. A. Higgins (1998). "Dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia and disruption of prepulse inhibition: evidence for a role of D-3 receptors?" Behavioural Pharmacology 9(5-6): 445-455.

	The dopamine D-3/D-2 receptor agonists 7-OH-DPAT, quinpirole, quinelorane, and PD128907, the mixed dopamine agonist apomorphine, the D-2 agonist bromocriptine, and the D-1/D-5 agonist SKF38393 were examined in models of hypothermia and prepulse inhibition (PPI) in Wistar rats. As dopamine agonist-induced hypothermia has been proposed as a model of D-3 receptor function, and dopamine agonists are known to disrupt PPI, drug potencies to induce hypothermia were established and compared with doses necessary to disrupt PPI. 7-OH-DPAT, quinpirole, quinelorane, PD128907, and apomorphine, reduced body temperature and disrupted PPI with a similar rank order of potency (quinelorane > quinpirole = 7-OH-DPAT > PD128907 = apomorphine). Bromocriptine and SKF38393 were ineffective in both models. In a separate study, the dopamine reuptake inhibitors cocaine and GBR 12909 had no effect on PPI. In a final set of studies, the D-2/D-3 antagonist raclopride blocked both 7-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia and 7-OH-DPAT-induced PPI disruption. The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100,135, and the peripheral D-2-like antagonist domperidone had no effect. These findings suggest that the hypothermia and PPI disruptions seen with some of these dopamine agonists may be mediated by central D-3 receptors; however, only studies using more selective dopamine receptor ligands can definitively rule out effects at the D-2 or D-4 receptors.
