Judge, S. J. and S. E. Gartside (2006). "Firing of 5-HT neurones in the dorsal and median raphe nucleus in vitro shows differential alpha(1)-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A receptor modulation." Neurochemistry International 48(2): 100-107.

	The median raphe nucleus and dorsal raphe nucleus together are the major source of ascending 5-HT projections. Here, using in vitro extracellular single unit electrophysiology we examined the responses of individual neurones in the rat median raphe nucleus and dorsal raphe nucleus to alpha-adrenoceptor and 5-HTIA receptor activation and made comparisons between the two nuclei. In the presence of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (1 mu M) all spontaneously active neurones recorded in the median and dorsal raphe nuclei fired slowly (< 5 Hz) and regularly. Most were inhibited by 5-HT (10-50 mu M), although a few were excited by 5-HT. 5-HT-induced inhibition was attenuated by the 5-HTIA receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (100 nM). Compared to those in the dorsal raphe nucleus, the neurones in the median raphe nucleus which were inhibited by 5-HT had: (1) lower basal firing rates in the continuous presence of phenylephrine (1 mu M), (2) smaller excitatory responses to higher concentrations of phenylephrine (3-10 mu M), (3) smaller excitatory responses to brief application of norepinephrine (10-100 mu M) and (4) smaller inhibitory responses to 5-HT (10-50 mu M). The lower sensitivity of median raphe neurones to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor excitation and 5-HTIA receptor inhibition will have consequences for 5-HT neurotransmission in forebrain regions innervated by the two nuclei.
