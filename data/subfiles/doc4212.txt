	In addition to evidence supporting serotonergic modulation of respiratory rhythmogenesis, serotonergic mechanisms play a role in central respiratory chemoreception. We examined the role of serotonin 5HT1A receptors in respiratory rhythmicity and central respiratory chemosensitivity in in vitro brainstem preparations of the bullfrog tadpole, Rana catesbeiana. Spontaneous respiratory motor output was recorded from cranial nerve 7 at control bath pH (7.8) and hypercapnic bath pH (7.4) as bath concentrations of a 5HT1A receptor agonist were steadily increased from 0.5 to 25 microM. Activation of the 5HT1A receptor significantly altered the respiratory burst cycle. Significant increases in both gill and lung burst cycle were observed in response to bath application of 8-OH-DPAT; gill burst cycle in response to 8-OH-DPAT was influenced by bath pH, as gill burst cycle at bath pH 7.8 was not significantly increased at 0.5 or 5.0 microM 8-OH-DPAT. However, when the pH was reduced to 7.4 gill burst cycle was significantly increased at these same bath concentrations of 8-OH-DPAT. Gill burst amplitude was not altered in response to bath application of 8-OH-DPAT; however, lung burst amplitude was significantly decreased at 25.0 microM 8-OH-DPAT at bath pH 7.8. These data indicate that 5HT1A receptors are involved in neural respiratory rhythmogenic and chemoreceptive circuits in the bullfrog tadpole, and support the hypothesis that abnormalities in serotonergic systems may be an underlying component of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.
