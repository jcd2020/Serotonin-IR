Uneyama, H., et al. (2002). "Receptor subtype specific activation of the rat gastric vagal afferent fibers to serotonin." Life Sci 72(4-5): 415-423.

	Systemic administration (i.v.) of serotonin (5-HT) evoked a transient vagal afferent nerve discharge, bradycardia, and hypotension in the rat. The half-effective dose of 5-HT for nerve discharge was 13 micro g/kg. The time- and dose-dependent kinetics of the nerve discharge rate were similar to the change of heart rate. The afferent neuronal discharge was mimicked by a selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 1-phenylbiguanide hydrochloride (PBA), and inhibited by a selective 5-HT3 antagonist, granisetron. The 5-HT(3/4) agonist, cisapride partially activated the vagus nerve, but the 5-HT4 agonist, RS6733 had no effect on the vagal afferent activity. Intra-gastric perfusion of lidocaine, moreover, abolished the 5-HT-induced vagal activation. These results indicate that the 5-HT transmission signal in the gastric mucosa inputs to the brain stem via 5-HT3 receptor-mediated vagal nerve afferent.
