Yu, H., et al. (1996). "Differential serotoninergic and dopaminergic activities of the (R)- and the (S)-enantiomers of 2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin." Eur J Pharmacol 303(3): 151-162.

	Racemic 2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ((R,S)-DPAT), which lacks phenolic or other aromatic substituents, induces both dopaminergic (sniffing, licking and gnawing) and serotoninergic (forepaw treading and flat body posture) behavioural responses. The present study shows that s.c. administration of(R)-DPAT induces typical 5-HT1A receptor agonist behaviours. These effects are blocked by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ((S)-UH-301). Administration of (S)-DPAT induces dopaminergic behaviours, which are fully antagonised by raclopride, a dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist. Both enantiomers induce hypothermia, (R)-DPAT being antagonised by (S)-UH-301, whereas (S)-DPAT is antagonised by raclopride. The accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan and DOPA (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) after decarboxylase inhibition that reflects presynaptic actions on 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) and dopamine neurons, respectively, are inhibited by both enantiomers of DPAT. (R)-DPAT is more potent than (S)-DPAT as an inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptophan accumulation whereas (S)-DPAT is more potent than (R)-DPAT as an inhibitor of DOPA accumulation. Thus, in functional tests of postsynaptic actions (R)-DPAT behaves as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and (S)-DPAT as a dopamine D-2 receptor agonist. Presynaptically, (R)-DPAT shows selectivity for 5-HT1A receptors and (S)-DPAT for dopamine D-2 receptors. Receptor binding studies, utilizing [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin and [H-3]quinpirole as radioligands for 5-HT1A and dopamine D-2 receptors, respectively, showed (R)-DPAT to have a 3-fold higher affinity than (S)-DPAT for 5-HT1A receptors, whereas (S)-DPAT had a 6-fold higher affinity than (R)-DPAT for dopamine D-2 receptors. Thus, the results from receptor binding studies support the conclusion that (R)- and (S)-DPAT are agonists showing selectivity for 5-HT1A and dopamine D-2 receptors, respectively. Taken together, these findings may explain previous controversies with regard to the pharmacology of racemic DPAT and re-emphasise the necessity to study pure enantiomers of chiral compounds.
