	Much interest is currently being directed towards serotonin (5-HT) receptors of type 2C (5-HT2C) because of their possible involvement in the control of different activities, such as the composition of the cerebrospinal fluid, locomotion, feeding, neuronal excitability and anxiety. The limited information regarding their distribution in the human brain prompted us to investigate, and to characterize the binding of [H-3]mesulergine, a HT2C antagonist, in autopsy samples from 24 subjects. The results showed that the [H-3]mesulergine binding represented 95% of the total binding and equilibrium saturation binding experiments resulted in a single straight line, consistent with the presence of one site only. The area with the highest density of [H-3]mesulergine binding was the choroid plexus, followed at a significantly lower level by the hippocampus, substantia nigra, basal ganglia, amygdala, hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex. The pharmacological profile of the [H-3]mesulergine binding was consistent with that of 5-HT2C receptors, since the most effective displacers were ritanserin, mesulergine and mianserine, followed by clozapine, ketanserine and III-CPP, while other compounds had a negligible or no effect. These findings, showing a wide distribution of [H-3]mesulergine binding sites in the human brain, could provide anatomical bases for the different functions attributable to 5-HT2C receptors in humans.
