	Dendritic spines are postsynaptic structures which are formed from filopodia. We examined roles of serotonin (5-HT) receptors in the spine formation. Embryonic rat cortical neurons were cultured for 10 or 14 days and treated by 5-HT receptor agonists for 24 h. At 11 days in vitro, 5-HT(1A) agonist increased filopodia density, whereas 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist increased the density of puncta and spines. At 15 days in vitro, 5-HT(1A) agonist decreased the density of puncta and spines, whereas 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist decreased filopodia density with increase of spines. In conclusion, the present study shows 5-HT receptors have subtype-specific effects on the spine formation.
