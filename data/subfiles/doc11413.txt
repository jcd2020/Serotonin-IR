Vanover, K. E., et al. (2004). "Pharmacological characterization of AC-90179 [2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-methyl-benzyl)-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-acetamide hydrochloride]: a selective serotonin 2A receptor inverse agonist." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 310(3): 943-951.

	The primary purpose of the present series of experiments was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo pharmacology profile of 2-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-N-(4-methyl-benzyl)-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)-acetamide hydrochloride (AC-90179), a selective serotonin (5-HT2A) receptor inverse agonist, in comparison with the antipsychotics haloperidol and clozapine. The secondary purpose was to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of AC-90179. Like all atypical antipsychotics, AC-90179 shows high potency as an inverse agonist and competitive antagonist at 5HT2A receptors. In addition, AC-90179 exhibits antagonism at 5HT2C receptors. In contrast, AC-90179 does not have significant potency for D2 and H1 receptors that have been implicated in the dose-limiting side effects of other antipsychotic drugs. The ability of AC-90179 to block 5-HT2A receptor signaling in vivo was demonstrated by its blockade of the rate-decreasing effects of the 5-HT2A agonist, (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride, under a fixed ratio schedule of reinforcement. Similar to clozapine and haloperidol, AC-90179 attenuated phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity. Although haloperidol impaired acquisition of a simple autoshaped response and induced cataleptic-like effects at behaviorally efficacious doses, AC-90179 and clozapine did not. Furthermore, unlike haloperidol and clozapine, AC-90179 did not decrease spontaneous locomotor behavior at efficacious doses. Limited oral bioavailability of AC-90179 likely reflects rapid metabolism rather than poor absorption. Taken together, a compound with a similar pharmacological profile as AC-90179 and with increased oral bioavailability may have potential for the treatment of psychosis.
