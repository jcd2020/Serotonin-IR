	Serotohin (5-HT)(2A) receptors are widely tributed, with high levels in the frontal where postsynaptic. activation may activity in pyramidal glutamatergic and mediate various executive functions. specifically, reciprocal cortical-raphe may allow the ventral prefrontal cortex to stress-induced neural activity in the when stressors; are perceived as However, early adversity and negative may be associated with higher frontal receptor levels and greater risk for psychopathology, and certain 5-HT2A gene ants have been associated with increased for impulsive behavior. Conversely, many depressants result in decreased levels of receptor levels, and blockade of 5-HT2A has proven useful in the treatment of a of psychiatric disorders.
