	1 The radioligand binding characteristics of the H-3-derivative of the novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist BRL46470 were investigated and directly compared to the well characterized 5-HT3 receptor radioligand [H-3]-granisetron, in tissue homogenates prepared from rat cerebral cortex/hippocampus, rat ileum, NG108-15 cells, HEK-5-HT3As cells and human putamen. 2 In rat cerebral cortex/hippocampus, rat ileum, NG108-15 cell and HEK-5-HT3As cell homogenates, [H-3]-BRL46470 bound with high affinity K-d (nM): 1.57 +/- 0.18, 2.49 +/- 0.30, 1.84 +/- 0.27, 3.46 +/- 0.36 respectively; mean +/- s.e. mean, n = 3 - 4 to an apparently homogeneous saturable population of sites (B-max (fmol mg(-1) protein): 102 +/- 16, 44 +/- 4, 968 +/- 32 and 2055 +/- 105, respectively; mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 3 - 4) but failed to display specific binding in human putamen homogenates. 3 In the same homogenates of rat cerebral cortex/hippocampus, rat ileum, NG108-15 cells, HEK-5-HT3As cells and human putamen as used for the [H-3]-BRL46470 studies, [H-3]-granisetron also bound with high affinity (K-d (nM): 1.55 +/- 0.61, 2.31 +/- 0.44, 1.89 +/- 0.36, 2.03 +/- 0.42 and 6.46 +/- 2.58 respectively; mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 3 - 4) to an apparently homogeneous saturable population of sites (B-max (fmol mg(-1)protein): 39 +/- 4, 20 +/- 2, 521 +/- 47, 870 +/- 69 and 18 +/- 2, respectively; mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 3 - 4). 4 Competition studies with a range of structurally different 5-HT3 receptor ligands indicated that in both rat cerebral cortex/hippocampus and rat ileum homogenates, [H-3]-BRL46470 binding exhibited a pharmacological profile consistent with the labelling the 5-HT3 receptor with compounds competing with Hill coefficients close to unity. 5 In HEK-5-HT3As cell homogenates, [H-3]-BRL46470 and [(3)]-granisetron associated rapidly ((3.84 +/- 0.4)10(6) M(-1)s(-1) and (5.85 +/- 0.2)10(6) M(-1)S(-1), respectively, mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 3 - 4) in an apparently monophasic manner. Following the establishment of equilibrium, both [H-3]-BRL46470 and [H-3]- granisetron at a saturating concentration ([H-3]-BRL46470 approximately 16nM; [H-3]-granisetron approximately 18 nM) and at a sub-K-d concentration (approximately 1 nM for both radioligands) dissociated biphasically in HEK-5-HT3As cell homogenates (saturating concentration; [H-3]-BRL46470 4.05 x 10(-3) +/- 2.53 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 5.83 x 10(-5) +/- 0.91 x 10(-5) s(-1); [H-3]-granisetron 3.20 x 10(-3) +/- 1.70 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 18.58 x 10(-5) +/- 4.19 x 10(-5) s(-1): sub-K-d concentration; [H-3]-BRL46470 2.47 x 10(-3) +/- 1.18 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 9.30 x 10(-5) +/- 2.59 x 10(-5) s(-1); [H-3]-granisetron 65.91 x 10(-3) +/- 22.14 x 10(-3) s(-1) and 49.96 x 10(-5) +/- 12.26 x 10(-5) s(-1), mean +/- s.e.mean, n = 4 - 8) when induced by a 300 fold dilution in ice-cold Tris/Krebs. 6 In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that [H-3]-BRL46470 specifically labels the 5-HT3 receptor in rat cerebral cortex/hippocampus, rat ileum, NG108-15 cell and HEK-5-HT3As cell homogenates, but fails to label the 5-HT3 receptor expressed in human putamen. Whilst the pharmacological profile of the site labelled by [H-3]-BRL46470 is directly comparable to that labelled by [H-3]-granisetron, [H-3]-BRL46470 consistently labelled approximately twice the density of sites compared to [H-3]-granisetron in the same tissue homogenates prepared from rat cortex/hippocampus, rat ileum, NG108-15 cells and HEK-5-HT3As cells.
