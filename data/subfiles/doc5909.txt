Kriem, B., et al. (1996). "Role of 5-HT1b receptor in the pressure-induced behavioral and neurochemical disorders in rats." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 53(2): 257-264.

	When human divers and experimental animals are exposed to increasing environmental pressure, they develop the high-pressure neurologic syndrome (HPNS) that has been recently demonstrated to include an increase in striatal dopamine (DA) release. This increase has been correlated with enhanced locomotor and motor activity (LMA). In the present study, we investigated the effect of the 5-HT1b receptor antagonist (+/-)cyanopindolol, which has been shown to block at normal pressure the increase in striatal DA release induced by the administration of the 5-HT1b receptor agonist CGS 12066B. Our data clearly showed that the administration of (+/-)cyanopindolol partially blocked both the pressure-induced increase in striatal DA release and the development of LMA. These results suggest the contribution of the 5-HT neurotransmission in the DA-related neurochemical and behavioral disorders that occur in rats exposed to high pressure.
