Penington, N. J. and J. S. Kelly (1990). "Serotonin receptor activation reduces calcium current in an acutely dissociated adult central neuron." Neuron 4(5): 751-758.

	The release of serotonin (5-HT) from the terminals of serotonergic (raphe) neurons is under inhibitory feed-back control. 5-HT, acting on raphe cell body autoreceptors, also mediates inhibitory postsynaptic potentials as a result of release from collaterals from neighboring raphe neurons. This may involve a ligand (5-HT)-gated increase in the membrane potassium conductance, leading to a decrease in action potential frequency, which could indirectly reduce calcium influx into nerve terminals. In this report we demonstrate that 5-HT can also directly reduce calcium influx at potentials including and bracketing the peak of calcium current activation. Using acutely isolated, patch-clamped dorsal raphe neurons, we found that low concentrations of 5-HT and the 5-HT1A-selective agonist 8-OH-DPAT reversibly decrease whole-cell calcium current. This effect is antagonized by the putative 5-HT1A-selective antagonist NAN 190. Hence, the inhibition of calcium current may serve a physiological role in these cells and elsewhere in the brain.
