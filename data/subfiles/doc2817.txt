Dugast, C., et al. (1998). "Is the potent 5-HT1A receptor agonist, alnespirone (S-20499), affecting dopaminergic systems in the rat brain?" European Journal of Pharmacology 350(2-3): 171-180.

	The effects of the new methoxy-chroman 5-HT1A receptor agonist, alnespirone (S-20499), on the dopamine systems in the rat brain were assessed in vivo by means of electrophysiological and neurochemical techniques. Cumulative doses of alnespirone (0.032-4.1 mg kg(-1), i.v.) did not modify the spontaneous firing rate of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra as well as in the ventral tegmental area. The local application of alnespirone (0.1-10 mu M) by reverse microdialysis into the dorsal striatum did not affect the dopamine output but induced a moderate, although dose-independent, increase of 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) concentrations in the dialysate. As expected of a 5-HT,, receptor agonist, intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of alnespirone at 2-32 mg kg(-1) markedly decreased 5-HT turnover in the striatum. Parallel measurements of dopamine turnover showed that alnespirone exerted no effect except at the highest dose (32 mg kg(-1), i.p.) for which a significant increase was observed. Interestingly, both alnespirone-induced reduction in 5-HT turnover and increase in dopamine turnover could be prevented by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexane carboxamide). Altogether, these data indicate that alnespirone does not exert any direct influence on central dopamine systems. The enhanced dopamine turnover due to alnespirone at high dose appeared to result from 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, further supporting the idea that this receptor type may play a key role in 5-HT-dopamine interactions in brain.
