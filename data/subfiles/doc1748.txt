Cervo, L., et al. (1989). "1-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl) piperazine (TFMPP) in the ventral tegmental area reduces the effect of desipramine in the forced swimming test in rats: possible role of serotonin receptors." Eur J Pharmacol 171(1): 119-125.

	1-(3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP), a serotonin1 (5-HT1) receptor agonist, injected i.p. in doses of 0.1 and 0.6 mg/kg, did not modify the immobility time of rats in the forced swimming test but significantly antagonized the effect of a 7 days treatment with 10 mg/kg per day desipramine (DMI). A similar effect was found on infusing 1 and 5 micrograms/microliters TFMPP bilaterally into the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Infusion of 5 micrograms/microliters TFMPP into the nucleus accumbens or into the globus pallidus did not modify the effect of DMI. The effect of 5 micrograms TFMPP infused into the VTA was prevented by the i.p. administration of 5 mg/kg metergoline, a non-selective serotonin receptor antagonist. Infusion of 5 micrograms/microliters 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, a specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist, into the VTA did not modify the effect of DMI. Besides acting as a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, TFMPP may also act on other 5-HT receptor types, but available evidence suggests that its former action is more important. It thus appears that 5-HT1 receptors in the VTA, presumably of the 5-HT1B type, act by preventing the anti-immobility effect of DMI. The role of VTA dopamine and non-dopamine cells in the effect of TFMPP is discussed.
