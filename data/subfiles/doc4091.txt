	In the rat brain, the presynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) autoreceptors located on 5-HT terminals correspond to the 5-HT1B subtype. The presence of a 5-HT receptor probably located on 5-HT nerve endings and modulating transmitter release in the human neocortex has been reported, but its detailed pharmacological characterization is not yet available. On the other hand, receptor binding and autoradiographic results indicate that the 5-HT1B receptor subtype is not present in the human brain. We, therefore, studied the modulation of the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT by various 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists in preloaded slices of human neocortex obtained from 18 patients undergoing neurosurgery. The nonselective 5-HT1A/1B/1D receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine produced a potent inhibition (70% at 0.03 microM) of the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT which was blocked by 5-HT receptor antagonists with the following relative order of potency: methiothepin greater than metergoline = methysergide greater than propranolol. The selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin at 0.1 microM did not modify the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT. The 5-HT1A/1B receptor agonist RU 24969 was 10 times more potent at inhibiting [3H]5-HT overflow in the rat frontal cortex than in the human neocortex. The potent 5-HT1B receptor antagonist cyanopinodolol did not modify the 5-carboxamidotryptamine-induced inhibition of the electrically evoked release of [3H]5-HT in slices of the human neocortex, but produced by itself a small inhibition of [3H]5-HT overflow.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
