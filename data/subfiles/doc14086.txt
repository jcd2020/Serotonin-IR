	AIM: Examine the expression of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA and co-localization of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA with 5-HT immunoreactivity in nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) neurons following carrageenan inflammation. METHODS: In situ hybridization (ISH) and combining fluorescent ISH with immunofluorescent histochemical double staining technique were used in the present study. RESULTS: 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was expressed in moderate level in NRM neurons. Following carrageenan inflammation, the expression of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA in NRM was greatly increased. The peak occurred at 3 - 8 h and then there was a clear decrease at 24 h after injection of carrageenan. Only a few 5-HT2A receptor mRNA and 5-HT immunoreactive double labeled cells were observed in NRM, and the number of the double labeled cells had no obvious change following carrageenan inflammation. CONCLUSION: The synthesis of 5-HT2A receptor was increased in non-serotonin rather than serotonin neurons of NRM during peripheral inflammation.
