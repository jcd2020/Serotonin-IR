	Previous studies have shown that 5-hydroxytryptamin(2A) (5-HT2A) receptor activation induces changes in the pattern of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression in the neocortex and hippocampus, and that 5-HT2A receptor blockade interferes with the induction of BDNF mRNA by stress. Recent studies have also shown that activation of metabotropic glutamate group II (mGlu2/3) receptors suppresses 5-HT2A receptor-stimulated excitatory postsynaptic potentials/currents (EPSP/Cs) in pyramidal neurons in medial prefrontal cortex. Conversely, blockade of mGlu2/3 receptors enhances 5-HT-induced EPSCs. The current study examined the effects of the highly selective mGlu2/3 agonist (1S,2S,5R,6S)-2-aminobicyclo[3.1.0]hexane-2,6-dicarboxylate monohydrate (LY354740) and the mGlu2/3 antagonist 2S-2-amino-2-(1S,2S-2-carboxycycloprop-1-yl)-3(xanthy-9-yl)propanoic acid (LY341495) on BDNF mRNA expression in medial prefrontal cortex induced by the hallucinogen and 5-HT2A/2B/2C agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenethyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI). LY354740 (0.1-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently suppressed DOI-induced BDNF mRNA levels in medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, the mGlu2/3 antagonist LY341495 (1 mg/kg) enhanced DOI-induced BDNF mRNA levels. BDNF mRNA expression was not altered by administration of the mGlu agonist or the antagonist alone. These results are discussed with respect to-a potential role for group II mGlu agonists in the treatment of depression and schizophrenia. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.
