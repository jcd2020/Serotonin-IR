Fox, S. H. and J. M. Brotchie (1999). "A role for 5-HT2C receptor antagonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease?" Drug News Perspect 12(8): 477-483.

	In recent years, there has been great interest in the application of novel 5-HT2C receptor antagonists to the treatment of disorders such as anxiety, depression and migraine. In this article the authors discuss the potential application of these agents to Parkinson's disease. Current treatments for Parkinson's disease rely on dopamine replacement given as the dopamine precursor levodopa or as directly acting dopamine receptor agonists. Unfortunately, long-term treatment generally results in disabling side effects. However, alternative, nondopaminergic approaches to Parkinson's disease are theoretically possible. The neural mechanisms underlying parkinsonian symptoms involve not only reduced dopaminergic neurotransmission, but also overactivity of the output regions of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and medial globus pallidus. 5-HT2C receptors are present in high concentrations in these output regions, where they exert an excitatory influence. There is an increase in 5-HT2C receptor binding in the SNR in Parkinson's disease compared to age-matched controls. Furthermore, enhanced 5-HT2C receptor-mediated transmission within the output regions of the basal ganglia in parkinsonism appears to contribute to the overactivity of the basal ganglia output regions. Blockade of overactive 5-HT2C receptor-mediated activity with selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonists can potentiate the antiparkinsonian action of dopamine receptor agonists. Thus, selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonists may be useful in reducing our reliance upon dopaminergic replacement therapy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. (C) 1999 Prous Science.
