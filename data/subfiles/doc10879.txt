Takeuchi, K., et al. (2014). "Serotonin-2C receptor involved serotonin-induced Ca2+ mobilisations in neuronal progenitors and neurons in rat suprachiasmatic nucleus." Scientific Reports 4.

	The hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), the central circadian pacemaker in mammals, undergoes serotonergic regulation, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we generated a subclone of an SCN progenitor cell line expressing Ca(2+)sensors (SCN2.2YC) and compared its 5-HT receptor signalling with that of rat SCN neurons in brain slices. SCN2.2YC cells expressed 5-HT1A/2A/2B/2C, but not 5A/7, while all six subtypes were expressed in SCN tissues. HighK(+) or 5-HT increased cytosolic Ca2+ in SCN2.2YC cells. The 5-HT responses were inhibited by ritanserin and SB-221284, but resistant to WAY-100635 and RS-127445, suggesting predominant involvement of 5-HT2C for Ca2+ mobilisations. Consistently, Ca2+ imaging and voltage-clamp electrophysiology using rat SCN slices demonstrated post-synaptic 5-HT2C expression. Because 5-HT2C expression was postnatally increased in the SCN and 5-HT-induced Ca2+ mobilisations were amplified in differentiated SCN2.2YC cells and developed SCN neurons, we suggest that this signalling development occurs in accordance with central clock maturations.
