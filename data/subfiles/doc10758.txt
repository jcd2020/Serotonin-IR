	7-Arylsulfonyl substituted benzofuropiperidine was discovered as a novel scaffold for 5HT(6) receptor antagonists. Optimization by substitution at C-1 position led to identification of selective, orally bioavailable, brain penetrant antagonists with reduced hERG liability. An advanced analog tested in rat social recognition model showed significant activity suggesting potential utility in the enhancement of short-term memory.
