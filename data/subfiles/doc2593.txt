Curran, A. K. and J. C. Leiter (2007). "Baroreceptor-mediated inhibition of respiration after peripheral and central administration of a 5-HT1A receptor agonist in neonatal piglets." Exp Physiol 92(4): 757-767.

	Inhibition of neurones in the ventral medulla accentuates the respiratory inhibition associated with acute blood pressure elevation in piglets. Activation of presynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors inhibits serotonergic neurones in the ventral medulla and caudal raphe, and we tested the hypothesis that administration of 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT(1A) agonist, within the rostroventral medulla and caudal raphe would enhance baroreceptor-mediated inhibition of respiratory activity in decerebrate, neonatal piglets. Baroreceptor stimulation was achieved by inflating a balloon in the distal aorta to elevate carotid blood pressure. After two to four control trials of baroreceptor stimulation, each piglet was given either a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 10 microg kg(-1) 8-OH-DPAT or treated by adding 10 or 30 mm 8-OH-DPAT to the dialysate for approximately 10 min to inhibit serotonergic neurones, after which the baroreceptor stimulation trials were repeated. Baroreceptor stimulation reduced respiratory activity, particularly the respiratory frequency, which diminished from 35.7 +/- 3.3 to 33.8 +/- 3.1 breaths min(-1) (P < 0.02) and, following i.v. 8-OH-DPAT, baroreceptor-mediated inhibition of respiratory output was significantly accentuated (P < 0.05); the respiratory frequency declined from 34.5 +/- 3.6 to 26.5 +/- 2.9 breaths min(-1). Increasing aortic blood pressure reduced the respiratory frequency (P < 0.01), but focal dialysis of 10 or 30 mm 8-OH-DPAT had, on average, no effect on the ventilatory inhibition associated with an acute elevation of blood pressure. We conclude that activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors after systemic administration of 8-OH-DPAT enhanced baroreflex-mediated inhibition of ventilation, but this effect cannot be attributed to 5-HT(1A) receptor activation within the rostroventral medulla and caudal raphe.
