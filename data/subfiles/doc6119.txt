Lanfumey, L., et al. (1999). "5-HT1A autoreceptor desensitization by chronic ultramild stress in mice." Neuroreport 10(16): 3369-3374.

	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL and biochemical approaches were used to assess possible changes in central 5-HT neurotransmission in mice that had been subjected to chronic ultramild stress for 8 weeks. This treatment produced a significant decrease in the potency of the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone to inhibit the electrical activity of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus, without modifying 5-HT1A receptor binding in various brain areas. These data demonstrate that chronic ultra-mild stress triggers a long term and durable functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in mice.
