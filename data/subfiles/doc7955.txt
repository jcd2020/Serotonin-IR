	The present strategy for the prevention of excessive sympathetic neural traffic to the heart relies on the use of beta-blockers, drugs that act at the heart end of the brain-heart axis. In the present study, we attempted to suppress cardiac sympathetic nerve activity by affecting the relevant cardiomotoneurons in the brain using the selective serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). In conscious, unrestrained rabbits, instrumented for recordings of heart rate, arterial pressure, or cardiac output, we provoked increases in cardiac sympathetic activity by psychological ( loud sound, pinprick, and air jet) or inflammatory (0.5 mu g/kg iv lipopolysaccharide) stresses. Pinprick and air-jet stresses elicited transient increases in heart rate (+ 50 +/- 7 and + 38 +/- 4 beats/min, respectively) and in mean arterial pressure ( + 16 +/- 2 and + 15 +/- 3 mmHg, respectively). Lipopolysaccharide injection caused sustained increases in heart rate ( from 210 +/- 3 to 268 +/- 10 beats/min) and in arterial pressure ( from 74 +/- 3 to 92 +/- 4 mmHg). Systemically administered 8-OH-DPAT (0.004 - 0.1 mg/kg) substantially attenuated these responses in a dose-dependent manner. Drug effects were prevented by a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY-100635 ( 0.1 mg/kg iv). Similarly to systemic administration, microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT ( 500 nl of 10 mM solution) into the medullary raphe-parapyramidal region caused antitachycardic effects during stressful stimulation and during lipopolysaccharide-elicited tachycardia. This is the first demonstration that activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the medullary raphe-parapyramidal area causes suppression of neurally mediated cardiovascular changes during acute psychological and immune stresses.
