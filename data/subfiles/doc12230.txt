	The influence of drugs, agonist and antagonist or serotonin receptors 5-HT1A on the behavior of rats tested by the method of choice to the value of reinforcement was investigated. Depending on their preferences in food reinforcement rats were divided into self-monitoring (choosing more valuable, delayed reinforcement) and impulsive (low value, immediate reinforcement). An hour before the test animals were administrated i.p. agonist 5-HT1A receptors 8-OH-D-PAT, [(+/-)-8-Hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin] in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg or antagonist WAY-100635, [N-[2-[4-(2-Methoxypheny1)-1-piperazinyl]lethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide maleat salt] at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Evaluated parameters, such as number of clicks on a particular pedal, the latencies and number of omitted responses. The results showed that the administration of drugs to modify individual behavior parameters both groups of animals. The introduction of 5-HT1A agonist receptors in impulsive animals caused an increase in the number of clicks on the pedal for more valuable reinforcement, arid administration of an antagonist did not have any significant effect to behavior.
