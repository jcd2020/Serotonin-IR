North, R. A. and N. Uchimura (1989). "5-Hydroxytryptamine acts at 5-HT2 receptors to decrease potassium conductance in rat nucleus accumbens neurones." J Physiol 417: 1-12.

	1. Intracellular recordings were made from neurones in the nucleus accumbens in slices from the rat brain maintained in vitro. 2. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT.1-100 microM) depolarized 170 of 203 (84%) neurones and caused them to discharge action potentials. The depolarization was associated with an increase in the input resistance, and was reversed in polarity by conditioning hyperpolarization; this reversal potential was linearly related to the logarithm of the extracellular potassium concentration. 3. Application of 5-HT to neurones voltage-clamped near their resting potential (typically about -80 mV) caused an inward current and a decrease in the slope conductance. The current caused by 5-HT reversed polarity at the potassium equilibrium potential. Analysis with an equivalent circuit model of the neurone at steady state indicated that 5-HT selectively reduced the inward rectifier potassium conductance. 4. The depolarization caused by 5-HT persisted in tetrodotoxin (1 microM). It was reduced but not abolished by a solution that contained lower levels of calcium (0.24 instead of 2.4 mM), higher levels of magnesium (5 instead of 1.2 mM), and cobalt (2 mM). 5. The depolarization caused by 5-HT was competitively antagonized by the 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin and mianserin with dissociation equilibrium constants of 3 and 45 nM respectively: spiperone (300 nM) also blocked the action of 5-HT. The depolarization was not mimicked or blocked by a number of other agonists and antagonists selective for the 5-HT1 and 5-HT3 receptor types.
