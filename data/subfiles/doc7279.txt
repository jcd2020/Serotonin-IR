	Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), commonly known as serotonin, has diverse physiological roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). 5-HT is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are five receptor subtypes within the G-protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F. 5-HT1A receptors are abundantly present in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, raphe nucleus, and septum; the lowest densities are observed in the basal ganglia, substantia nigra, and cerebellum (5). Some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei have intermediate densities. 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the mediation of emotion and the function of the hypothalamus. 5-HT1A receptors are implicated in anxiety, depression, hallucinogenic behavior, motion sickness, and eating disorders (6). Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of 5-HT1A receptors. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT1A radioligands [PubMed] such as [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY 100635, [(18)F]FPWAY, and [(18)F]MPPF for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, none of these antagonists distinguishes between the high- and low-affinity states of the 5-HT1A receptors. The high-affinity state of the receptor is coupled to G-proteins, which mediate the functions of cells by providing intracellular signals. 2-(4-(4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H) dione (MMP) was reported to be a potent agonist of 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 0.15 nM) (7). This led to the development of [O-methyl-(11)C]2-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-tri azine-3,5(2H,4H)dione ([(11)C]MMP, also known as [(11)C]CUMI-101) as a useful tool for in vivo PET imaging of the 5-HT1A receptor.
