Tominaga, K., et al. (1992). "Effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonists on the circadian rhythm of wheel-running activity in hamsters." Eur J Pharmacol 214(1): 79-84.

	The effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone and ipsapirone on wheel-running activity in hamsters were investigated in comparison with those of GABAA receptor agonist muscimol and benzodiazepine triazolam. Intraperitoneal administration of 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone, ipsapirone, muscimol and triazolam at circadian time (CT) 8 (CT 12; onset of activity) induced a significant phase advance of wheel-running activity under constant light conditions. However, administration of these drugs at other CT points did not induce phase changes. The administration of trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, at CT8 produced a small phase advance. The phase advance induced by 8-OH-DPAT was blocked by pretreatment with (-)-pindolol, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and SM3997 accelerated the rate of re-entrainment to an 8-h phase advance in the light-dark cycle. These observations suggest that 5-HT1A receptors in the brain participate in the regulation of the circadian rhythm of wheel-running activity in hamsters.
