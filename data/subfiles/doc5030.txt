Hartig, P. R., et al. (1992). "A SUBFAMILY OF 5-HT1D RECEPTOR GENES." Trends Pharmacol Sci 13(4): 152-159.

	The recent discovery and characterization of three new 5-HT1 receptor clones and the pharmacological characterization of one orphan receptor (dog RDC4) has revealed a surprising complexity within the 5-HT1D receptor subfamily. This receptor subfamily, which is believed to be the target of the anti-migraine drug sumatriptan and may regulate feeding behavior, anxiety, depression, cardiac function and movement, can now be approached on a molecular level. These cloning discoveries have also taught us an important general lesson about the molecular pharmacology of G protein-coupled receptor genes: species homologues of a gene (the equivalent gene in different species) may be highly homologous in amino acid sequence yet display very different pharmacological properties. Conversely, two different genes in the same species (intraspecies subtypes) that display only moderate degrees of transmembrane amino acid homology can display nearly indistinguishable pharmacological properties. In discussing the implications of these findings for both 5-HT receptors and G protein-linked receptors in general, Paul Hartig, Theresa Branchek and Richard Weinshank approach the question: why have so many receptor subtypes been preserved in the genome? In addition, controversy has been raging for several years over the classification of 5-HT1B receptors (found only in rat brain) and 5-HT1D receptors. Were they different subtypes or simply species homologues of the same receptor? Recent cloning studies have apparently complicated this issue, but the answer to the question is, in fact, becoming clearer.
