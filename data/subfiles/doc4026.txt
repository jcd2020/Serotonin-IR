Fujii, T., et al. (1997). "Demonstration of the facilitatory role of 8-OH-DPAT on cholinergic transmission in the rat hippocampus using in vivo microdialysis." Brain Res 761(2): 244-249.

	The role of the serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor in the regulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the hippocampus was investigated using an in vivo microdialysis technique and a sensitive radioimmunoassay specific for ACh. The mean (+/- S.E.M.) basal ACh contents in the hippocampal perfusate of conscious, freely moving rats was 60 +/- 4 (n = 29) and 3691 +/- 265 fmol/30 min (n = 31), respectively, in the absence and presence of physostigmine (Phy) in the perfusion fluid. Systemic administration of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.5 mg/kg, s.c.), a 5-HT1A agonist, significantly enhanced ACh release both in the presence and absence of Phy. Local application of 8-OH-DPAT (3-30 microM) into the hippocampus through the microdialysis probe significantly potentiated ACh release only in the presence of Phy, whereas no significant effect was observed in its absence. Pretreatment with NAN-190 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), a 5-HT1A antagonist, eliminated the increasing effect of systemically applied 8-OH-DPAT on ACh release, while NAN-190 alone had no effect on basal ACh release either in the absence or presence of Phy. Consistent with the time course of ACh release, systemic administration of 8-OH-DPAT evoked hyperlocomotion, which was reversed by NAN-190. However, local hippocampal application of 8-OH-DPAT did not affect the locomotor activity of the rats. These findings suggest that at least two different sites are involved in the 8-OH-DPAT-induced increase in the release of ACh in the rat hippocampus in vivo.
