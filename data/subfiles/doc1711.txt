	Different receptor subtypes mediate the effects produced by serotonin (5-HT) in mammals. Besides their proved anxiolytic action, agonists of the 5-HT1A receptor subtype show prospects as antidepressants or neuroprotective agents in case of ischemia. In order to better define the pharmacological profile and determine the selectivity for the 5-HT receptor type, the properties of the new 5-HT1A receptor agonist 2[[4-(o-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-methyl]-1.3-dioxoperhydroimidazo[1.5-a]pyri dine (B-20991), an arylpiperazine derivative, have now been further studied. B-20991 was found to antagonize the forskolin-induced increase of cAMP synthesis in a HeLa cell line transfected with the human 5-HT1A in a process sensitive to the selective blocker N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-cyclohexanecarboxami de maleate (WAY 100635). Additionally, B-20991 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of the spontaneous on-going activity of serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus in rats, an effect that was reversed by treatment with WAY 100635. This, together with the fact that the hypothermia induced by B-20991 in mice was also antagonized by WAY 100635, suggests that the new compound acts upon somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors. Additional activation of 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptors was indicated by the increase of corticosterone plasma levels induced by B-20991 in the rat. These results demonstrate that B-20991 is a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist acting both pre- and postsynaptically, which represents an useful pharmacological tool to study 5-HT1A-receptor-mediated effects.
