McCreary, A. C. and S. L. Handley (2000). "Chronic administration of the cholesterol reducing drug gemfibrozil fails to alter 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A mediated receptor behaviours in rats." Journal of Psychopharmacology 14(3): 280-283.

	Some studies have suggested that reductions in plasma cholesterol might be associated with suicidal behaviour. Serotonergic systems are thought to be involved in suicidal ideation and behaviour and links with altered 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors have been proposed. We have therefore examined the effects of cholesterol reduction using gemfibrozil, upon 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor-related behaviours in rats. Rats were treated chronically (57 days) with gemfibrozil (50 mg/kg p.o.) or gum acacia vehicle and challenged sequentially with the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-d-n-aminopropyl tetralin, to elicit 5-HT1A syndrome behaviours, and the 5-HT2 receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-amino-propane to establish their head-shake frequency. Significant cholesterol reduction, within the clinical range, failed to induce any changes in either 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A mediated behaviours. These data suggest that cholesterol reduction fails to induce changes in 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor tone suggesting that the reduction of plasma cholesterol, within the human clinical range, does not result in neuroplasticity of the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in rats.
