	Extracellular single-unit recordings in mouse brain slices were used to determine the effect of exogenously applied 5-HT on STN neurones. Recordings were made from 74 STN cells which fired action potentials at a regular rate of 7.19 +/- 0.5 Hz. In 61 cells (82%), 5-HT application increased STN neurone firing rate (10 mu M, 180 +/- 16.8%, n = 35) with an estimated EC50 of 5.4 mu M. The non-specific 5-HT2 receptor agonist alpha-methyl 5-HT (1-10 mu M) mimicked 5-HT induced excitations (15 cells). These excitations were significantly reduced by pre-perfusion with the specific 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS102221 (500 nM, 9 cells) and the 5HT(4) antagonist GR113808 (500 nM, 7 cells). In 6 cells (8%) 5-HT induced biphasic responses where excitation was followed by inhibition, while in 7 cells (9%) inhibition of firing rate was observed alone. Inhibitory responses were reduced by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100135 (1 mu M, 4 cells). No inhibitory responses were observed following alpha-methyl 5-HT applications. Both the excitations and inhibitions were unaffected by picrotoxin (50 mu M, n = 5) and CNQX (10 mu M, n = 5) indicative of direct postsynaptic effects. Thus, in STN neurones, 5-HT elicits two distinct effects, at times on the same neurone, the first being an excitation which is mediated by 5-HT2C and 5-HT4 receptors and the second an inhibition which is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.
