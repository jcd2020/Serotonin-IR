Cesana, R., et al. (1993). "MESULERGINE ANTAGONISM TOWARDS THE FLUOXETINE ANTI-IMMOBILITY EFFECT IN THE FORCED SWIMMING TEST IN MICE." Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology 45(5): 473-475.

	The anti-immobility effect of fluoxetine (40 mg kg-1) in the forced swimming test in mice was antagonized by the 5-HT1c/2 antagonist mesulergine (7.5 mg kg-1) and the dopamine D2 antagonist (+/-)-sulpiride (12.5 mg kg-1) but not by the 5-HT2/1C antagonist ritanserine (2 mg kg-1), the 5-HT1A/1B antagonist (-)-propranolol (20 mg kg-1) or the 5-HT3 antagonist DAU 6215 (0.1 mg kg-1). All compounds were administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) 6 min before fluoxetine, given i-p. 30 min before testing. The anti-immobility effect of fluoxetine was also prevented by pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg kg-1 twice daily for 3 days) which produced an 80% reduction of 5-HT in brain. The results suggest that fluoxetine reduces immobility time in mice forced to swim, by acting indirectly through a mesulergine-sensitive site, probably the 5-HT1C receptor.
