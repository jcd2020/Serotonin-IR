	Some users of 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) abuse this drug and/or become concerned about their use. These individuals would benefit greatly from the development of pharmacological strategies to reduce MDMA consumption. We have previously observed that antipsychotics block acquisition and expression of the conditioned place preference (CPP) induced by MDMA, though they do not modify priming-induced reinstatement of MDMA-induced CPP after extinction. In the present study we have evaluated the capacity of the mixed serotonin (5-HT2A)/dopamine (DA D2) antagonist risperidone to block acquisition and reinstatement of MDMA induced-CPP. Adolescent male mice conditioned with 10mg/kg of MDMA were treated with 0.1 or 0.3mg/kg of risperidone during acquisition of conditioning (experiment 1) or before the reinstatement test (experiment 2). Risperidone was devoid of motivational effects in the CPP paradigm, but the higher dose blocked acquisition of the MDMA-induced CPP. This behavioural effect was accompanied by an increase in the level of dopamine transporters in the striatum. However, risperidone had no effects on reinstatement of the CPP induced by a priming of MDMA. Our results suggest that risperidone induces the same effects as other antipsychotics, in which case its efficacy for treating MDMA abuse is limited.
