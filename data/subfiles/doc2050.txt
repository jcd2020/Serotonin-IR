	Treadmill exercise (1 h at 20 m/min) has been shown to increase brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis/metabolism in 4-day trained rats. This work has analysed whether these changes are associated with (5-HT-dependent or -independent) alterations in pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor-mediated behaviours; in addition, the controversial hypothesis that exercised rats are less anxious than sedentary rats was tested in the elevated plus-maze and the social interaction models. Acute administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.125-0.5 mg/kg) triggered hyperphagia, forepaw treading, and Aat body posture, the amplitude of which were not affected by training or acute exercise. In the elevated plus-maze, training, but not acute exercise, reduced the number of total arm entries. In the social interaction test, trained and acutely exercised rats displayed increased locomotion and decreased defecation, compared to resting rats, but social interaction and rearings were not affected. It is suggested that the aforementioned effects of acute exercise upon 5-HT synthesis/metabolism in short-term trained rats are not associated with changes in 5-HT1A receptor- and anxiety-related behaviours.
