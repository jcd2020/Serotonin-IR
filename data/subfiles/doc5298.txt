	Partial D-2/3 dopamine (DA) receptor agonists provide a novel approach to the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) that may avoid common dopaminergic side-effects, including dyskinesia and psychosis. The present study focussed on the in vivo pharmacological and therapeutic characterisation of the novel D-2/3 receptor partial agonist and full 5-HT1A receptor agonist pardoprunox (SLV308; 7- [4-methyl-1-piperazinyl]-2(3H)-benzoxazolone monochloride). Pardoprunox induced contralateral turning behaviour in rats with unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine-induced lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) (MED = 0.03 mg/kg; po). In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated common marmosets, pardoprunox dose-dependently increased locomotor activity (MED = 0.03 mg/kg; po) and decreased motor disability (MED = 0.03 mg/kg; po). The effects of pardoprunox were reversed by the D-2 antagonist sulpiride. In contrast pardoprunox attenuated novelty-induced locomotor activity (MED = 0.01 mg/kg; po), (+)-amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion (MED = 0.3 mg/kg; po) and apomorphine-induced climbing (MED = 0.6 mg/kg; po) in rodents. Pardoprunox also induced 5-HT1A receptor-mediated behaviours, including flat body posture and tower lip retraction (MED = 0.3 mg/kg; pa) and these were reversed by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that pardoprunox possesses
