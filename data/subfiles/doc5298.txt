	Autoregulatory mechanisms affecting serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] release and synthesis during the early period of development were investigated in dissociated cell cultures raised from embryonic rostral rat rhombencephalon. The presence of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in serotoninergic neurons was assessed using binding assays. The involvement of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in the control of the synthesis and release of [3H]5-HT was studied using biochemical approaches with several serotoninergic receptor ligands. A mean decrease of 30% in [3H]5-HT synthesis and release was observed in the presence of 5-HT (10(-8) M), the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), the 5HT1B/1A agonist 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969), the 5-HT1B agonist 3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrid-4-yl)pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyrid-5-one (CP-93,129), and the 5-HT(1D/1B) agonist sumatriptan. Inhibition of 5-HT synthesis and release induced by 8-OH-DPAT was blocked by chiral N-tert-butyl-3-[1-[1-(2-methoxy)phenyl]piperazinyl]-1-phenylpropionam ide dihydrochloride quaternary-hydrate (WAY 100135) (10(7) M) or methyl 4-[4-[4-(1,1,3-trioxo-2H-1,2-benzoisothiazol-2-yl)butyl]-1-p iperazinyl]-1Hindole-2-carboxylate (SDZ 216-525) (10(-7)M), and that of CP-93,129 was blocked by methiothepin (10(-7) M). Paradoxically, extracellular levels of [3H]5-HT increased in the presence of 8-OH-DPAT and RU 24969 at 10(-6) M. 5-HT uptake experiments showed that these two agonists interacted with the 5-HT transporter. 5-HT1 binding sites (620 fmol/mg of protein) and 5-HT1A (482 fmol/mg of protein) and 5-HT1B (127 fmol/mg of protein) receptors were detected in 12-day in vitro cell cultures. Experiments carried out with tetrodotoxin suggested that 5-HT1A receptors are located on nerve cell bodies, whereas 5-HT1B receptors are located on the nerve terminals. We concluded that autoregulatory mechanisms involving 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptors are functionally mature in cells from rostral raphe nuclei during the early period of development.
