Hatanaka, K., et al. (2000). "Effect of acute treatment with YM992 on extracellular serotonin levels in the rat frontal cortex." Eur J Pharmacol 395(1): 23-29.

	(S)-2-[[(7-fluoroindan-4-yl)oxy]methyl]morpholine monohydrochloride (YM992) is a novel putative antidepressant exhibiting both selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibition and 5-HT2A receptor antagonism. In vivo microdialysis revealed that a single treatment with YM992 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg i.p.) dose-dependently increased extracellular 5-HT levels in the rat frontal cortex. Fluoxetine, citalopram and venlafaxine also produced significant increases in 5-HT levels at doses of 10-30 mg/kg. However, the increase in 5-HT levels induced by YM992 was significantly larger than increases elicited by these three compounds at 30 mg/kg. The combined administration of R-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphmyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-piperidine-methanol (MDL100,907) (a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist) and citalopram produced no additional increase in 5-HT levels compared with citalopram treatment alone. YM992 moderately enhanced [H-3]5-HT release from rat cerebral cortex synaptosomes using different mechanisms than p-chloroamphetamine. In comparison, 10-mu M fluoxetine markedly induced 5-HT release in vitro, while citalopram and venlafaxine had no noticeable effect on release. YM992 produces a more robust increase of 5-HT levels acutely than other antidepressants in vivo and the effect may be due to 5-HT releasing properties of the drug. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.
