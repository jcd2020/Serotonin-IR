Gobert, A., et al. (1997). "Potentiation of the fluoxetine-induced increase in dialysate levels of serotonin (5-HT) in the frontal cortex of freely moving rats by combined blockade of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors with WAY 100,635 and GR 127,935." J Neurochem 68(3): 1159-1163.

	In this study, we examined the influence of blockade of serotonin (5-HT)1A and/or 5-HT1B autoreceptors on the fluoxetine-induced increase in dialysate levels of 5-HT as compared with dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NAD) in single samples of the frontal cortex (FCx) of freely moving rats. Fluoxetine (10.0 mg/kg, s.c.) elicited a twofold increase in dialysate levels of 5-HT relative to baseline values. The selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100,635 (0.16 mg/kg, s.c.) did not influence 5-HT release alone but doubled the influence of fluoxetine on basal levels. Similarly, the selective 5-HT 1B/1D antagonist GR 127,935 (2.5 mg/kg, s.c.) did not alter basal 5-HT levels alone and doubled the fluoxetine-induced increase in 5-HT levels. Combined administration of WAY 100,635 and GR 127,935 elicited an (at least) additive rise in the fluoxetine-induced increase in 5-HT levels to eightfold basal values, without modifying resting 5-HT levels. These changes were selective for 5-HT inasmuch as the parallel (twofold) increase in DA and NAD levels provoked by fluoxetine was not potentiated. The present data demonstrate that combined blockade of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptors markedly and selectively potentiates the fluoxetine-induced increase in dialysate levels of 5-HT versus DA and NAD in the FCx of freely moving rats. These observations suggest that 5-HT 1A/1B antagonism may represent a novel strategy for the improvement in the therapeutic profile of 5-HT reuptake inhibitor antidepressant agents and that 5-HT may be primarily involved in such interactions.
