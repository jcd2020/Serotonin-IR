Langlois, M., et al. (1993). "STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS BY THE COMPARATIVE MOLECULAR-FIELD ANALYSIS METHOD OF THE AFFINITY OF BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR BLOCKING-AGENTS FOR 5-HT1A AND 5-HT1B RECEPTORS." European Journal of Pharmacology-Molecular Pharmacology Section 244(1): 77-87.

	The affinities of 17beta-adrenoreceptor antagonists for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors were evaluated in binding assays. A large range of K(i) values (2-10,000 nM) was observed and ortho or meta substitution of the aromatic ring carrying the amino chain was implicated in the high affinity K(i) values, whereas para substitution elicited a dramatic drop in activity. These variations were analyzed with two molecular design tools: the active analogue approach (AAA) and the new 3D-QSAR (quantitative structure activity relationship) method, comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). The AAA method emphasized, by superimposition of selected conformations of the molecules, the favorable and unfavorable volumes implicated in the receptor recognition. CoMFA generated a linear expression between the biological data and the different values of electrostatic and steric fields surrounding the molecules. It predicted the values of selected molecules but also those of new molecules not included in the study. The excellent accuracy of the prediction revealed the potential of the method for the design of new compounds. CoMFA demonstrated the important contribution of steric parameters, evaluated at 92%, compared to the electrostatic field (evaluated at 8%) to explain the affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors. This study emphasizes also the importance of the occupancy of a hydrophobic pocket in the receptor site located near the area interacting with the aromatic moiety, and subsequently its use for the design of new, potent, specific antagonists of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.
