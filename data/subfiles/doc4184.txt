Gartside, S. E., et al. (1992). "SELECTIVE 5-HT(1A)-RECEPTOR-MEDIATED AND 5-HT(2)-RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ADRENOCORTICOTROPIN RELEASE IN THE RAT - EFFECT OF REPEATED ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS." Eur J Pharmacol 221(1): 27-33.

	The 5-HT receptor agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane DOI) produced dose-dependent increases in plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in the male rat by activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors respectively. The ACTH response to DOI was enhanced by repeated administration of electroconvulsive shock (five over 10 days) but abolished by the tricyclic antidepressant, amitriptyline (20 mg/kg for 14 days). In contrast 21 days lithium treatment failed to alter DOI-induced ACTH release. Neither repeated electroconvulsive shock, nor amitriptyline, nor lithium altered the ACTH response to 8-OH-DPAT. These data are consistent with results from ligand binding and behavioural studies which suggest that the sensitivity of brain 5-HT2 receptors is increased by repeated electroconvulsive shock but attenuated by tricyclic antidepressant treatment. In contrast, our data suggest that the antidepressant treatments studied do not alter the sensitivity of the 5-HT1A receptors involved in ACTH release.
