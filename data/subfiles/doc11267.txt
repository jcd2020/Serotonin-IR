	Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis induces hyperglycemia and serotonin (5-HT)2A receptor supersensitivity. In the present study, to investigate the effect of hyperglycemia on the function of 5-HT2A receptors, we compared the 5-HT2A receptor-mediated wet-dog shake responses in rats treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), dexamethasone and streptozotocin. ACTH (100 ug/rat per day, s.c.), dexamethasone (1 mg/kg per day, s.c.) and streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p.) produced significant hyperglycemia at 14 days after the start of these treatments, and the hyperglycemia was most pronounced in the streptozotocin-treated rats. The wet-dog shake responses induced by (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), a 5-HT2A receptor agonist, were significantly enhanced at 14 days after repeated treatment with ACTH and dexamethasone. However, streptozotocin-induced diabetes had no effect on the wet-dog shake responses. The results of the present study suggest that hyperglycemia is not strongly associated with the enhanced susceptibility of 5-HT2A receptors under the condition of hyperactivity of the HPA axis.
