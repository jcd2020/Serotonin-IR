	5-HT1B autoreceptors are involved in the control of extracellular 5-HT levels from both the terminal and cell body regions of serotonergic neurones. In this study we report on the effect of a selective and potent 5-HT1B receptor inverse agonist, SB-236057-A (1'-ethyl-5-(2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,3,4-oxadiazolyl-2-yl)biphenyl4-carbonyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrospiro[furo[2,3-f] piperidine] hydrochloride), on extracellular 5-HT levels in the cortex and dentate gyrus of the freely-moving guineapig, using the technique of in vivo microdialysis. SB-236057-A had ca. 23% bioavailability following oral drug administration. In vivo hypothermia pharmacodynamic assays demonstrated it was brain penetrant with a duration of action in excess of 18 h. SE-236057-A (0.75 mg/kg p.o.) increased extracellular 5-HT levels in the dentate gyrus to a maximum of 167+/-7% of basal but had no effect in the frontal cortex. However, a small increase in cortical 5-HT levels (117 +/- 11% of basal) was evident at 2.5 mg/kg p.o. In addition, SE-236057-A (0.75 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg p.o.) antagonised the sumatriptan-induced inhibition of extracellular 5-HT levels in the guinea-pig frontal cortex. These differences were attributed to MRN-innervated regions (e.g. dentate gyrus) being more responsive to 5-HT1B receptor-mediated negative feedback than DRN-innervated regions (e.g. frontal cortex). In the dentate gyrus, the increase in 5-HT release induced by SE-236057-A (0.75 mg/kg p.o.) was comparable to that after 14 days of paroxetine (10 mg/kg p.o.) administration, reaching a maximum of 183 +/- 13% of basal. These data suggest that acute 5-HT1B receptor blockade, by virtue of increased 5-HT release in the dentate gyrus, may provide a rapidly acting antidepressant.
