Oz, M., et al. (2002). "Direct noncompetitive inhibition of 5-HT3 receptor-mediated responses by forskolin and steroids." Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics 404(2): 293-301.

	5-HT3 receptors cloned from NCB-20 cells were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, and the effects of forskolin and steroids on the function of the receptors were investigated using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Forskolin, 17-beta-estradiol, and progesterone inhibited the currents activated by 1 muM 5-HT in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 12, 33, and 89 muM, respectively. The inhibitory effects of forskolin and 17-beta-estradiol were independent of the membrane potential. Forskolin and 17-beta-estradiol significantly reduced the maximal amplitude of the 5-HT concentration-response curve (E-max) without significantly affecting the EC50, indicating that these compounds act as noncompetitive inhibitors of the 5-HT3 receptor. The cAMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP (0.2 mM), and the protein kinase A activator, Sp-cAMP (0.1 mM), did not affect the amplitude of 5-HT3 receptor-mediated currents. The membrane-permeable protein kinase A inhibitor Rp-cAMP (0.1 mM) and the estrogen-receptor antagonist tamoxifen (1 muM) did not affect the inhibition of 5-HT-activated current. In addition, 5-HT3 receptor-mediated currents were inhibited by both 1,9-dideoxy forskolin (30 muM), which does not activate adenylyl cyclase, and wForskolin (30 muM), a charged hydrophilic analogue of forskolin that is membrane impermeable. These results indicate that both forskolin and 17-beta-estradiol inhibit the function of the 5-HT3 receptor in a noncompetitive manner and that this inhibition is independent of cAMP levels.
