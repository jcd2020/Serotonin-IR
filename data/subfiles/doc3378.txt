Forbes, I. T., et al. (1996). "Synthesis, biological activity, and molecular modeling of selective 5-HT(2C/2B) receptor antagonists." J Med Chem 39(25): 4966-4977.

	The synthesis and biological activity are reported for a series of analogues of the previously published indole urea 2 (SB-206553), designed to probe the 5-HT(2C) receptor binding site. Small molecule modeling studies have been used to define a region in space which is allowed at the 5-HT(2C) receptor but disallowed at the 5-HT(2A) receptor. In a complementary approach, docking of 2 into our model of the 5-HT(2C) receptor has allowed us to propose a novel primary binding interaction for this series of diaryl ureas, involving a potential double hydrogen-bonding interaction between the urea carbonyl oxygen of the ligand and two serine residues in the receptor. The difference of two valine residues in the 5-HT(2C) receptor for leucine residues in the 5-HT(2A) receptor is believed to account for the observed 5-HT(2C)/5-HT(2A) selectivity with 2.
