	Serotonin 5-HT2B receptor antagonists have been proposed as migraine prophylactic drugs, but previously available 5-HT2B receptor antagonists displayed multiple monoaminergic side effects and had to be withdrawn from the market. Here, we set out to identify a novel antagonist with high affinity and selectivity towards 5-HT2B receptors. To test the affinity of new compounds towards various receptors, we generated a broad series of cells functionally coupling human monoaminergic receptors to luciferase. Using the cell lines we revealed pimethixene (1-methyl-4-(9H-thioxanthen-9-ylidene)piperidine) as highly potent, albeit non-selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist and optimized its chemical structure to create highly potent and selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonists. We selected the methoxythioxanthene BF-1 for further analysis. In comparison to pimethixene, it lacked high affinities to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, histamine H1, dopamine D1 and D2 as well as muscarinic M1 and M2 receptors. BF-1 was tested as potential migraine prophylactic drug by blocking meta-chlorophenylpiperazine, (mCPP) or BW723C86 (5-((thiophen-2-yl)methoxy)-Î±-methyltryptamine) induced neurogenic dural plasma protein extravasation in a guinea pig model that may resemble a migraine attack. BF-1 was significantly more potent in this assay compared to the well know non-selective 5-HT2B antagonists, methysergide ((6aR,9R)-N-[(2S)-1-Hydroxybutan-2-yl]-4,7-dimethyl-6,6a,8,9-tetrahydroindolo[4,3-fg]quinoline-9-carboxamide) or pizotifen (4-(1-methyl-4-piperidylidine)-9,10-dihydro-4H-benzo-[4,5]cyclohepta[1,2]-thiophene). Therefore, we propose BF-1 as a new compound that may be developed for prophylactic migraine treatment without the typical monoaminergic side effects.
