	Steroid hormones synthesized in the brain, called 'neurosteroids', modulate neuronal activity. We treated, neonatal rats with a main precursor of the neurosteroidogenesis, pregnenolone, and examined adenosine A(2A) receptor, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) and 5-HT7 receptor densities in the front-parietal cortex in juvenile and adult rats. In receptor binding assay using [H-3]CGS21680 and [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, it was shown that neonatal pregnenolone-treatment induced a significant decrease in the adenosine A2A receptor density with no significant effects on the 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor densities.
