	1. We have examined the interaction of tertiary amine local anesthetics with the bovine hippocampal serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor, an important member of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. 2. The local anesthetics inhibit specific agonist and antagonist binding to the 5-HT1A receptor at a clinically relevant concentration range of the anesthetics. This is accompanied by a concomitant reduction in the binding affinity of the 5-HT1A receptor to the agonist. Interestingly, the extent of G-protein coupling of the receptor is reduced in the presence of the local anesthetics. 3. Fluorescence polarization measurements using depth-dependent fluorescent probes show that procaine and lidocaine do not show any significant change in membrane fluidity. On the other hand, tetracaine and dibucaine were found to alter fluidity of the membrane as indicated by a fluorescent probe which monitors the headgroup region of the membrane. 4. The local anesthetics showed inhibition of agonist binding to the 5-HT1A receptor in membranes depleted of cholesterol more or less to the same extent as that of control membranes in all cases. This suggests that the inhibition in ligand binding to the 5-HT1A receptor brought about by local anesthetics is independent of the membrane cholesterol content. 5. Our results on the effects of the local anesthetics on the ligand binding and G-protein coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor support the possibility that G-protein-coupled receptors could be involved in the action of local anesthetics.
