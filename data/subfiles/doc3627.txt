Fedotova Iu, O. (2010). "[Behavioral effects of m-CPP and ketanserine during ovarian cycle in female rats]." Eksp Klin Farmakol 73(11): 6-9.

	A comparative analysis of the influence of chronic administration of the 5-HT2B/2C receptor agonist, m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), and the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, ketanserine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 days on the anxiety and depressive-like behavior in the adult female rats was performed. The depression in rats was modeled using the Porsolt test. The anxiety level was assessed in the elevated plus maze test. It was established that ketanserine induced antidepressive and anxiolytic effects in females during estrous and proestrous periods. The m-CPP administration also resulted in antidepressive effect in both estrous and proestrous periods. A clear modulation was observed in the anxiety behavior as dependent on the ovarian cycle phases in rats treated with m-CPP: the anxiolytic effect was manifested at an increased level of estrogens, while anxiogenic effect was manifested at a reduced level of estrogens. It is suggested that 5-HT subtype receptors are involved to different extent in the mechanisms of anxiety-depressive-like behavior depending on the alterations of hormonal balance during the ovarian cycle. The data obtained are indicative of a close interaction between the ovarian hormonal and serotonergic systems of the brain in the mechanisms of anxiety and depression.
