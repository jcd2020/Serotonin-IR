Small, C., et al. (1991). "The guinea-pig ileum preparation as a model for 5-HT1A receptors: anomalous effects with RS-30199-193." Br J Pharmacol 104(2): 519-525.

	1. Agents that have high and selective affinity for the 5-HT1A site such as 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and N,N-dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine (DP5CT) inhibited the responses to field stimulation in guinea-pig ileum preparations; the inhibitory effects were antagonized by methiothepin and spiperone, consistent with effects at the 5-HT1A site. 2. The inhibitory effects of DP5CT were pronounced in Tyrode solution containing low Ca2+ (0.9 mM), but were much less apparent in Tyrode solution containing 1.8 or 5.4 mM Ca2+. 3. Responses to DP5CT were abolished by pretreatment with phorbol dibutyrate (3 microM), whereas the responses to UK14304 were only slightly inhibited. 4. Buspirone and ipsapirone (1 microM) inhibited the responses to field stimulation, and the effects were resistant to idazoxan, but inhibited by 8-OH-DPAT or spiperone. 5. RS-30199-193 (5-chloro-2-methyl-1,2,3,4,8,9,10,10a-octahydronaphth-[1,8-cd]- aze pine hydrochloride) an azepine with high affinity for the 5-HT1A site in rat cerebral cortex in binding experiments, augmented contractions, but did not antagonize the responses to DP5CT or to 8-OH-DPAT. 6. The hybrid compound of RS-30199-193 with buspirone, RS-64459-193 (5-chloro-2-[4-(8-azaspiro[4,5]decane-7,9-dione)-but-1-yl]- 1,2,3,4,8,9,10,10a-octahydronaphth[1,8-cd]-3-azepine hydrochloride) maintained high affinity for the 5-HT1A binding site in rat brain and both inhibited the response to field stimulation and antagonized the responses to 8-OH-DPAT and DP5CT. Thus the buspirone side chain when added to RS-30199-193 appears either to induce affinity for a distinct subset of receptors in the guinea-pig ileum or is required for functional effectiveness at the 5-HTlA receptor.
