	Feeding a vitamin B-6-deficient diet to rats causes a moderate hypertension. The blood pressure responses to 5-HT1A receptor agonists were studied in conscious vitamin B-6-deficient hypertensive rats. They were all effective in lowering blood pressure with the following rank order of potency: 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) > flesinoxan > 5-methylurapidil > urapidil. The putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonist spiroxatrine by itself, did not have any effect on the blood pressure at the doses used (0.01-1 mumol/kg). However, dose dependently, it antagonized the hypotensive effect of flesinoxan and urapidil. The alpha1-adrenoreceptor antagonist prazosin, on prior treatment, did not change the hypotensive effect of either flesinoxan or urapidil. The alpha2-adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine dose dependently (0.01-0.1 mumol/kg) reduced blood pressure. This effect of clonidine was unaffected by spiroxatrine, but was dose dependently antagonized by the alpha2-adrenoreceptor antagonist yohimbine. Binding studies with [H-3)8-OH-DPAT indicated that the affinity and B(max) of 5-HT1A receptors was increased in vitamin B-6-deficient hypertensive rats. The results suggest that decreased synthesis of 5-HT in brain regions and the consequent alterations in 5-HT receptors in the vitamin B-6-deficient rats may be the underlying cause of the hypertension seen in these animals.
