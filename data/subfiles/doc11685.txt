Wang, Y., et al. (1997). "Blockade of serotonin-2C receptors by mesulergine reduces ocular dominance plasticity in kitten visual cortex." Exp Brain Res 114(2): 321-328.

	We have investigated the role of serotonin-2C (5-HT2C) receptors in modulation of ocular dominance plasticity in kitten visual cortex. A small quantity of the 5-HT2C receptor blocker, mesulergine, was infused into the visual cortex of one hemisphere of 5- to 7-week-old kittens using osmotic minipumps, while the control hemisphere received vehicle solution. At the same time, one eyelid of the experimental animals was sutured shut. The ocular dominance distributions in the visual cortex (area 17) were assessed using extracellular recording methods after 1 week of combined mesulergine infusion and monocular deprivation. We found that the majority of the neurons remained binocularly responsive in the mesulergine-treated hemisphere, while most of the neurons recorded were either unresponsive or only weakly responsive to the deprived eye in the control hemisphere. Local infusion of mesulergine into the kitten visual cortex thus reduced the shift of ocular dominance that normally occurs in animals of these ages following monocular deprivation. The blocking effect seems to be distance-dependent and therefore dose-dependent: the farther away the recording sites were from the injection site, the fewer binocularly responsive cells were found. These results are relevant to previous findings indicating transient overexpression of 5-HT2C receptor in visual cortex of kittens at these ages. The data suggest that the 5-HT2C receptor system may be involved in the formation and modification of ocular dominance columns in the developing visual cortex.
