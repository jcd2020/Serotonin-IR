	The present study aimed to quantify neurons expressing the serotonin-1B receptor and evaluate numerical differences in normally behaving and pathologically aggressive dogs in order to assess whether the serotonin-1B receptor is involved in pathological canine aggression. Because previous studies have reported structural alterations in the basolateral nuclear group (BNG) of the amygdaloid body of aggressive dogs, this structure was selected as region of interest in the present study. Indirect immunohistochemistry was applied to visualise the serotonin-1B-receptor-positive neurons. Immunoreactivity was located predominantly within the neuronal cell bodies and adjacent neuronal processes. In the aggressive dogs the BNGs contained a significantly higher number of serotonin-1B-receptor-positive neurons compared to the normally behaving dogs. This number was strongly correlated with the total number of neurons per BNG, which was also significantly increased in aggressive dogs compared to normal dogs. The percentage of neurons expressing the serotonin-1B receptor did not differ significantly between both groups. No significant asymmetries were observed for the number and percentage of serotonin-1B-receptor-positive neurons. Potential relationships between the present findings and the etiology of aggressive behaviour, the neuroprotective role of the serotonin-1B receptor and receptor dysfunction are discussed.
