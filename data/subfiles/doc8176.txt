Matsuda, T., et al. (1991). "GONADAL-HORMONES AFFECT THE HYPOTHERMIA INDUCED BY SEROTONIN1A (5-HT1A) RECEPTOR ACTIVATION." Life Sci 48(17): 1627-1632.

	Subcutaneous injection of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) in mice caused hypothermia which was antagonized by pindolol. The hypothermic effect of 8-OH-DPAT was pronounced in female than in male mice. The sex difference in the hypothermic effect was also observed after pretreatment with proadifen. The hypothermic effect of 8-OH-DPAT was attenuated by ovariectomy. In the ovariectomized mice, the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on rectal temperature was enhanced by chronic estradiol and the enhancement was blocked by simultaneous administration of testosterone. In male mice the hypothermic effect of 8-OH-DPAT was enhanced by castration. These results suggest that gonadal hormones affect the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated response.
