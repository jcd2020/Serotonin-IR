	1 A novel compound, SE-272183 (5-Chloro-2, 3-dihydro-6-[4-methylpiperazin-1-yl]-1[4-pyridin-4-yl]napth-1-ylaminocarbonyl]-1H-indole), has been shown to have high affinity for human 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors with pK(i) values of 8.0, 8.1 and 8.7 respectively and is at least 30 fold selective over a range of other receptors. 2 [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding studies showed that SE-272183 acts as a partial agonist at human recombinant 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors with intrinsic activities of 0.4, 0.4 and 0.8 respectively, compared to 5-HT. SE-272183 inhibited 5-HT-induced stimulation of [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding at human 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors to give pA(2) values of 8.2 and 8.5 respectively. However, from [S-35]-GTP gammaS autoradiographic studies in rat and human dorsal raphe nucleus, SB-272183 did not display intrinsic activity up to 10 muM but did block 5-HT-induced stimulation of [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding. 3 From electrophysiological studies in rat raphe slices in vitro, SE-272183 did not effect cell firing rate up to 1 muM but was able to attenuate (+)8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of cell firing to give an apparent pK(b) of 7.1. 4 SE-272183 potentiated electrically-stimulated [H-3]-5-HT release from rat and guinea-pig cortical slices at 100 and 1000 nM, similar to results previously obtained with the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, GR127935. 5 Fast cyclic voltammetry studies in rat dorsal raphe nucleus showed that SE-272183 could block sumatriptan-induced inhibition of 5-HT efflux, with an apparent pK(b) of 7.2, but did not effect basal efflux up to 1 muM. 6 These studies show that, in vitro, SE-272183 acts as an antagonist at native tissue 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.
