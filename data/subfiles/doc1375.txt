Broqua, P., et al. (1993). "Antidepressant/anxiolytic ipsapirone inhibits cold-induced hypothalamic TRH release." Neuroreport 4(10): 1200-1202.

	Acute administration of the serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonist ipsapirone has been previously shown to elicit a dose-dependent decrease of cold-elicited thyrotropin (TSH) secretion. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate, by means of a push-pull cannula implanted in the median eminence (ME), whether ipsapirone acts primarily through an inhibition of cold-elicited thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) release. Ipsapirone administration (10 mg kg-1 i.p., 30 min before cold) prevented cold-elicited TRH release, thereby confirming the above hypothesis. In addition, this study further validates push-pull perfusion in the ME as a key tool for measuring TRH secretion in vivo.
