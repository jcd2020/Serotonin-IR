	Serotonin is a neuromodulator that mediates a wide range of effects by interacting with multiple receptors. Using a strategy based on nucleotide sequence homology between genes encoding receptors that interact with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, we have isolated a mouse gene encoding an additional serotonin receptor. When expressed in cultured cells, it displayed the pharmacological profile and coupling with adenylate cyclase characteristic of the 5HT1B receptor subtype. In NIH 3T3 cells expressing this receptor, serotonin induced a decrease in forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. This effect was blocked by pertussis toxin, indicating that the 5HT1B receptor interacts with a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein. To obtain clues as to the possible function of the 5HT1B receptor, we have analyzed its pattern of expression in the adult mouse brain by in situ hybridization. Our results, together with previous autoradiographic studies, suggest that the 5HT1B receptors are localized presynaptically on the terminals of striatal neurons and Purkinje cells and that they might modulate the release of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid. The predominant expression of the 5HT1B receptor in the striatum and cerebellum points to an involvement of this receptor in motor control.
