Allen, A. R., et al. (1997). "The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist p-MPPI blocks responses mediated by postsynaptic and presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 57(1-2): 301-307.

	The present experiments examined the ability of the novel 5-HT1A receptor antagonist to block responses mediated by postsynaptic and presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in vivo. Pretreatment with p-MPPI reduced or blocked the effect of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT on two responses mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, reduction of body temperature and the 5-HT behavioral syndrome. Administration of p-MPPI alone did not alter body temperature or produce symptoms of the 5-HT syndrome. Pretreatment with p-MPPI also blocked the ability of 8-OH-DPAT to reduce extracellular 5-HT in the striatum, a response mediated by presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus, but did not alter striatal 5-HT when administered alone. These results indicate that p-MPPI is an effective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist in vivo with no intrinsic activity. p-MPPI may prove to be a useful pharmacological tool for studying 5-HT1A receptors and their involvement in anxiety and affective disorders.
