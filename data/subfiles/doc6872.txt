Kulikov, A. V., et al. (1995). "5-HT2A SEROTONIN RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN OF RATS AND MICE HEREDITARILY PREDISPOSED TO CATALEPSY." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 50(3): 383-387.

	Specific binding of [H-3]ketanserin to 5-HT2A serotonin receptor sites in the corpus striatum and frontal cortex and the effect of 5-HT2A antagonists in rats and mice hereditarily predisposed to catalepsy has been studied. Cyproheptadine inhibited the expression of inherited catalepsy in rats and mice, whereas more selective 5-HT2A antagonists, ritanserin and ketanserin, failed to affect the catalepsy. A decrease in [H-3]ketanserin-specific binding site density in the striatum of cataleptic animals compared to their noncataleptic counterparts was found. It was suggested that the decrease in the density of 5-HT2A receptor binding sites in the striatum represents a result of their downregulation due to increased serotonergic neurotransmission in the striatum of cataleptic animals.
