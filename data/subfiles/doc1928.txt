	The aim of this study was to develop a highly reliable radiofluorination method for the preparation of N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(4-F-18-fluoromethylcyclohexane)carboxamide ([F-18]Mefway) by using a fully automated system. The optimal condition is composed of two parts. The extraction system of the trapped F-18 in the anion exchange resin (i.e., quaternary methylamine cartridge) is a complex of Kryptofix 2.2.2. (K222, 4mg/0.9mL methanol) and K2CO3 (1mg/0.1mL H2O). After removing the solvents, the trans-tosylated Mefway precursor (1mg/0.5mL acetonitrile) was reacted with dried K222-K[F-18] at 100 degrees C for 5min. After purification and formulation, [F-18]Mefway was obtained with 38 +/- 2.4% (decay corrected, n=34) radiochemical yield, a total synthesis time of 52 +/- 3.4min, specific activity was 120.6 +/- 8.7GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis and a radiochemical purity of 99%. According to the quality control tests, formulated [F-18]Mefway is suitable to apply parenteral clinical application.
