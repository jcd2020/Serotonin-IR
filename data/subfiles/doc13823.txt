	This study evaluated the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor positive cells in the cerebella of mice and human by immunocytochemistry. Mice were of ages 1, 3, and 12 months whereas the human subjects were divided into two groups, a younger 57-78 years old group and an older 82-91 years old group. Both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor positive cells were observed in the molecular and granular layers of the cerebella of mice and human. Although there was a decline in these positive cells during aging, no regional difference in the positive cells were observed in the anterior, middle, and posterior regions of the cerebella. Microsc.
