Frances, H. and C. Monier (1991). "TOLERANCE TO THE BEHAVIORAL-EFFECT OF SEROTONERGIC (5-HT1B) AGONISTS IN THE ISOLATION-INDUCED SOCIAL BEHAVIORAL DEFICIT TEST." Neuropharmacology 30(6): 623-627.

	In mice, isolation-induced social behavioural deficits are attenuated by stimulants of 5-HT1B receptors, such as TFMPP or CGS 120 66B. Repeated treatment with RU 24969 (5 mg/kg, daily, for 3 days) reduced the effect of TFMPP and that of other 5-HT1B agonists (CGS 120 66B, m-CPP, RU 24969). Similarly, repeated treatment with CGS 120 66B (8 mg/kg, twice a day, for 3 days) abolished the effect of a test-dose of the same drug. Desensitization of the 5-HT1B receptors involved in this effect is suggested to have occurred. Such a desensitization may be therapeutically relevant, since acute administration of benzodiazepines and chronic administration of antidepressants both reversed the effect of TFMPP.
