Lothe, A., et al. (2012). "5-HT(1A) receptor binding changes in patients with major depressive disorder before and after antidepressant treatment: a pilot [¹⁸F]MPPF positron emission tomography study." Psychiatry Res 203(1): 103-104.

	This is the first [¹⁸F]MPPF PET study in positron emission tomography study in depressed patients, both before and after treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Dynamic changes in [¹⁸F]MPPF binding potential were observed primarily in the medial orbital regions from baseline to 30 days of treatment, suggesting SSRI-mediated serotoninergic adaptative mechanisms.
