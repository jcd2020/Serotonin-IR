Majumdar, D., et al. (2006). "8-OH-DPAT attenuates isoproterenol- but not forskolin-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in mediobasal hypothalamus." Brain Res 1075(1): 93-99.

	Ovariectomized female rats were used to test the possibility that the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), inhibits cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Tissue slices were incubated with forskolin or with the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist, isoproterenol, to stimulate accumulation of cAMP. Both compounds increased accumulation of cAMP. The 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, reduced cAMP accumulation after stimulation by isoproterenol, but not after forskolin stimulation. These findings are discussed in terms of putative differences in the mechanisms whereby 5-HT(1A) receptors are able to inhibit stimulation of adenylate cyclase. The potential significance of these findings to 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated inhibition of female rat lordosis behavior is also discussed.
