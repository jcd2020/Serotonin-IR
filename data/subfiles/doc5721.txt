Iben, L. G., et al. (1994). "DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY OF H-3 AGONIST BINDING TO PRESYNAPTIC AND POSTSYNAPTIC 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN BOVINE BRAIN." Br J Pharmacol 113(4): 1400-1406.

	1 The full and weak partial 5-HT1A agonist ligands [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT and [H-3]-BMY-7378 were used to characterize the binding parameters of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A binding sites in bovine dorsal raphe and hippocampal membranes, respectively. The K-d and B-max values for the individual radioligands were indistinguisable across the regions tested, as were the K-i values generated by a series of agents acting at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. 2 The concentration-dependent allosteric attenuation of [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT and [H-3]-BMY-7378 binding produced by the nonhydrolyzable guanyl nucleotide, Gpp(NH)p, generated similar IC50 values within a particular region; however, these were significantly different between regions. While the maximal attenuation of [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT and [H-3]-BMY-7378 binding was similar in dorsal raphe, Gpp(NH)p produced a significantly greater attenuation of [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT binding in hippocampal membranes when compared to [H-3]-BMY-7378. The maximal attentuation of [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT binding by Gpp(NHp) in hippocampus was also significantly greater than that seen with either radioligand in dorsal raphe. 3 Although exposure to Gpp(NH)p had no effect on the affinity constants of either radioligand in either region, it produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the maximal number of binding sites for both radioligands in both regions. While the percentage reduction in B-max, values were similar for both radioligands in the dorsal raphe, Gpp(NH)p reduced the B-max of [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT in hippocampus significantly more than that of [H-3]-BMY-7378. 4 These results suggest that while pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors may share similar pharmacological recognition properties, a region-dependent difference in the coupling of the 5-HT1A receptor to G-proteins may exist.
