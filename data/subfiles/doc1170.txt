	OBJECTIVE: Serotonin type 1A receptors (5HT1ARs) have been shown to be affected by stress in experimental animals and related to anxiety and depression in humans. In the present study, the authors sought an association between 5HT1AR binding and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). METHOD: Using positron emission tomography and the radioligand [18F]FCWAY, the authors compared 5HT1AR binding between patients with PTSD and healthy subjects. RESULTS: No significant differences in 5HT1AR distribution volume, binding potential, or tracer delivery were found. CONCLUSIONS: 5HT1AR expression may not be altered in patients with PTSD.
