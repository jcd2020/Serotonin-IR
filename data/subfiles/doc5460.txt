Hof, R. P. and J. R. Fozard (1989). "8-OH-DPAT, flesinoxan and guanfacine: systemic and regional haemodynamic effects of centrally acting antihypertensive agents in anaesthetized rabbits." Br J Pharmacol 96(4): 864-871.

	1. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and flesinoxan, agents which show high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1A receptors, were administered intravenously in doses of 0.003 to 0.1 and 0.01 to 0.3 mg kg-1 respectively to 5 rabbits each. Their effects were compared with those of the centrally acting agent and alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, guanfacine, 0.01-0.3 mg kg-1, administered to a group of 5 rabbits. Five further rabbits were used as controls and treated with the vehicle of the active agents. 2. Both flesinoxan and 8-OH-DPAT induced similar systemic and regional haemodynamic changes. Both lowered mean arterial pressure and heart rate. The principal blood pressure lowering mechanism was vasodilatation; cardiac output changed minimally despite the falls in heart rate and myocardial contractile force. 3. With guanfacine the maximal fall of blood pressure was comparable to that obtained with the 5-HT1A receptor ligands; however, in contrast to the latter, the dose-response curve was U-shaped, the highest dose eliciting a pressor effect with reversal of the vasodilatation. 4. Widespread peripheral vasodilatation was found with all the agents in the splanchnic circulation and also in the brain and skeletal muscle. A weak tendency towards vasodilatation was found in the kidneys where the dose-response curve was bell-shaped for guanfacine. 5. This spectrum of activity is different from that of peripheral vasodilators, such as calcium antagonists, potassium channel activating agents or hydralazine; it is, however, consistent with the putative mechanism of action of these compounds to reduce peripheral sympathetic tone by a central mechanism of action.
