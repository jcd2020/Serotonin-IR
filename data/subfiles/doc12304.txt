	Many different 5-HT receptor subtypes have been identified, although the role of particular subtypes in the modulation of nociception is not known. It is known that 5-HT2A receptors play a role in spinal and peripheral sensitization and that they are expressed in neurons and astrocytes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of an intraperitoneally administered 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist and antagonist on hyperalgesia and allodynia using the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model and their concomitant effect on microglia activation in the spinal cord. Adult male Wistar rats were used. Experimental peripheral neuropathy was induced by a unilateral loose ligation of the sciatic nerve. We examined the effects of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist (+/-) -2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI, 0.6, 1 mg/kg), and the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist ketanserin (0.5, 1 mg/kg). Tactile withdrawal thresholds (von Prey test) and heat withdrawal latencies (radiant heat) were assessed before and 1 h after drug application. Microglia was labelled with rabbit anti-Iba1. CCI rats displayed a significant tactile and thermal allodynia compared with control rats. Significant microglial activation was observed in the dorsal horn mainly ipsilateral of the constriction of the sciatic nerve. Pain-like behaviour on von Frey test was observed after treatment with DOT, more pronounced at a higher dose. The administration of ketanserin had no effect on thermal hyperalgesia or mechanical allodynia. Five days after the treatment with DOT (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and ketanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) a decreased Iba1 immunoreactivity was observed. Our results suggest modulatory activity of the serotonergic system on microglial activation.
