Koe, B. K. and L. A. Lebel (1995). "Effects of serotoninergic agents on downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor sertraline." Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther 329(2): 231-244.

	The results of the present study show that the down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors of rat brain, induced by subacute administration of sertraline, is facilitated when this selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor was co-administered with the serotonin releaser, norfenfluramine, or the serotonin terminal autoreceptor antagonist, methiothepin. The respective drug combination produced a reduction in Bmax of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding to cortical membranes of treated rats at a dose of the releaser, release enhancer, or sertraline, which was ineffective when administered alone. In a similar manner, the 5-HT1A agonists, gepirone and 8-OH-DPAT, were found to facilitate the downregulation of beta-adrenoceptors induced by sertraline. The 5-HT1B agonist, 3-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine, and the 5-HT2 antagonist, ritanserin, showed neither facilitation nor antagonism of sertraline, but the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron, attenuated the decrease of Bmax of [3H]dihydroalprenolol binding elicited by sertraline. Agents that putatively increase the serotoninergic activity facilitated the down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors induced by sertraline, suggesting that the enhancement of serotonin transmission, expected of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor itself, may play a role in this effect of sertraline. Whether the downregulation of brain beta-adrenoceptors by sertraline plays any role in its antidepressant activity cannot be deduced from these experiments.
