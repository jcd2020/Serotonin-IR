Cozzi, N. V. and D. E. Nichols (1996). "5-HT2A receptor antagonists inhibit potassium-stimulated gamma-aminobutyric acid release in rat frontal cortex." European Journal of Pharmacology 309(1): 25-31.

	Several drugs selective for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor were tested for their effects on spontaneous and K+-evoked [H-3]gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release from slices of rat frontal cortex. Under K+ stimulation, the antagonists ketanserin, spiperone, R-(+)-alpha- (2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenethyl)]-4-piperidimemethanol (MDL 100,907) and ritanserin inhibited GABA release by 12-31%. Rats were treated with the serotonin-depleting agent para-chlorophenylalanine and with the serotonergic neurotoxin para-chloroamphetamine. In para-chlorophenylalanine-treated animals, stimulated GABA release in the presence of ketanserin remained depressed. In animals treated with both para-chlorophenylalanine and para-chloroamphetamine, ketanserin or the hallucinogenic agonist (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminoethane (2C-I) each appeared to decrease stimulated GABA release but this was not significant. However, when ketanserin and 2C-I were both present in the superfusion buffer an additive inhibitory effect was observed, and GABA release was decreased 30%. These results suggest that serotonin facilitates GABA release in cortex via 5-HT2A receptors and that the functional response of this system is resistant to serotonin depletion.
