Bristow, L. J., et al. (1991). "BEHAVIORAL AND BIOCHEMICAL-EVIDENCE OF THE INTERACTION OF THE PUTATIVE ANTIPSYCHOTIC AGENT, BMY-14802 WITH THE 5-HT1A RECEPTOR." European Journal of Pharmacology 204(1): 21-28.

	The behavioural and biochemical profile of the sigma-ligand and putative antipsychotic agent, BMY 14802 (alpha-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine butanol) has been determined in the mouse and rat. In mice, pretreatment with BMY 14802 attenuated both amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and conditioned avoidance responding, consistent with its previously reported antipsychotic potential. In common with 5-HT1A receptor agonists or partial agonists, BMY 14802 induced (a) a dose-dependent hypothermia in mice; (b) aspects of the 5-HT behavioural syndrome in rats, (c) antagonised mescaline-induced head twitches in mice and (d) generalised to the 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin discriminative stimulus over the dose range of 3-15 mg/kg. BMY 14802 had appreciable affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (pIC50 = 6.7 compared to 7.3 for sigma-binding) and antagonised forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with a pEC50 of 6.2, consistent with an agonist action at this receptor. The results support the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors, but not the sigma-binding site, in the behavioural profile of BMY 14802.
