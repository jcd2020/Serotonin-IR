Volk, B., et al. (2011). "Optimization of (arylpiperazinylbutyl)oxindoles exhibiting selective 5-HT₇ receptor antagonist activity." J Med Chem 54(19): 6657-6669.

	A series of (arylpiperazinylbutyl)oxindoles as highly potent 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists has been studied for their selectivity toward the 5-HT(1A) receptor and α(1)-adrenoceptor. Several derivatives exhibited high 5-HT(7)/5-HT(1A) selectivity, and the key structural factors for reducing undesired α(1)-adrenergic receptor binding have also been identified. Rapid metabolism, a common problem within this family of compounds, could be circumvented with appropriate substitution patterns on the oxindole carbocycle. Contrary to expectations, none of the compounds produced an antidepressant-like action in the forced swimming test in mice despite sufficiently high brain concentrations. On the other hand, certain analogues showed significant anxiolytic activity in two different animal models: the Vogel conflict drinking test in rats and the light-dark test in mice.
