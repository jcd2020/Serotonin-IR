Link, C. G. G., et al. (1993). "THE EFFECTS OF BRL-46470A, A NOVEL 5-HT3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, AND LORAZEPAM ON PSYCHOMETRIC PERFORMANCE AND THE EEG." British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology 35(4): 395-399.

	1 The effects of single doses of a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, BRL 46470A (0.1 mug, 0.01 mg, 1 mg or 50 mg) and lorazepam (2.5 mg) on psychometric performance and the EEG were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, crossover, placebo controlled study of 16 healthy male volunteers. 2 There was strong evidence that lorazepam had a marked effect on the EEG, increasing power in the 1 Hz to 7 Hz and 13 Hz to 20 Hz wavebands, whilst reducing power in the 8 Hz to 12 Hz waveband. Lorazepam also produced an impairment of daytime function as assessed by psychometric performance and subjective measures. 3 In contrast, there was little evidence to suggest that BRL 46470A had any effect on the EEG or that it impaired daytime function.
