Hagan, R. M., et al. (1990). "Effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists on responses to selective activation of mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways in the rat." Br J Pharmacol 99(2): 227-232.

	1. The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists on the behavioural hyperactivity response which results from injection of the neurokinin receptor agonist [pGlu5, MePhe8, Sar9]-substance P (5-11) (DiMe-C7) into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the rat midbrain have been determined. 2. Subcutaneous administration of ondansetron (GR38032) (0.001-0.3 mg kg-1), GR65630 (0.01 mg kg-1), ICS 205-930 (0.1 mg kg-1) and MDL 72222 (0.1 mg kg-1), inhibited the DiMe-C7-induced hyperactivity response. 3. The effects of ondansetron on DiMe-C7-induced changes in dopamine and 5-HT metabolism in discrete areas of rat forebrain were studied in order to investigate further the possible mechanism of action of 5-HT3 antagonists in modifying mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. 4. Intra-VTA administration of DiMe-C7 increased levels of dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercules and right amygdala, indicating increased mesolimbic dopamine metabolism. DOPAC levels were not significantly increased in the frontal cortex, left amygdala or striatum. Dopamine levels were not altered in any of these brain areas. DiMe-C7 also increased 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in the amygdala but this was only statistically significant in the right amygdala. 5-HT levels were not changed significantly by DiMe-C7 treatment. 5. In control rats, pretreatment with ondansetron (0.1 mg kg-1) had no effect on the levels of dopamine, 5-HT or their metabolites, but in rats given DiMe-C7, ondansetron significantly inhibited the increase in DOPAC levels in the nucleus accumbens. 6. These results are in agreement with the proposed facilitatory role of 5-HT3 receptor activation on mesolimbic dopaminergic transmission, and suggest that 5-HT3 antagonists may have important therapeutic indications for the treatment of CNS disorders in which mesolimbic dopamine systems are perturbed.
