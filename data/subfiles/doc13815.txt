	A series of new aporphine analogues (aporlogues) were prepared from appropriate aporphine precursors and arylpiperazines using the Click reaction protocol. These compounds displayed good to high affinity at the D-3 receptor, low or no affinity at the D-1 and D-2 receptors. Compounds 7f and 11c stood out as the most potent at the D-3 receptor among our newly synthesized aporlogues with K-i values of 2.67 and 1.14 nM, respectively. Further assay at the 5-HT1A receptor revealed that aporlogues 7f and 11c also showed high affinity at this receptor with K-i values of 9.68 and 7.59 nM, respectively. They were 3.6- and 6.6-fold more potent at the D-3 over 5-HT1A receptors. Such D-3/5-HT1A dual property of these compounds may be useful in the treatment of several brain disorders.
