	Opiate antagonist inhibition of deprivation-induced intake and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) hyperphagia is significantly enhanced by the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) antagonist, ICS-205,930. Interactions between opiate antagonists and either 5-HT or 5-HT2 antagonists produced smaller effects. The present study evaluated whether insulin (5 U/kg) hyperphagia was affected by methysergide (0.5-5 mg/kg), ritanserin (0.25-2.5 mg/kg), and ICS-205,930 (0.5-5 mg/kg) alone or in combination with naltrexone (2.5-10 mg/kg). Whereas ICS-205,930 stimulated insulin hyperphagia across the 6-h time course, ritanserin and, to a lesser degree, methysergide reduced insulin hyperphagia. Naltrexone marginally (19-33%) reduced insulin hyperphagia. Pairing naltrexone with either ICS-205,930 or ritanserin significantly suppressed insulin hyperphagia after 2 h. Pairing naltrexone with each of the serotonin antagonists significantly enhanced insulin hyperphagia after 4 and 6 h. These data suggest that 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor subtypes interact with opioid systems to modulate insulin hyperphagia. Given that central insulin reduces food intake and body weight, the interaction between serotonergic and opioid systems may occur peripherally.
