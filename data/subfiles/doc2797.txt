Druse, M. J., et al. (2007). "S100B-mediated protection against the pro-apoptotic effects of ethanol on fetal rhombencephalic neurons." Brain Research 1150: 46-54.

	Previously, this laboratory demonstrated that ethanol treatment significantly reduces the number of developing serotonin (5-HT) and other fetal rhombencephalic neurons in rats by augmenting apoptosis. Using a 5-HT1A agonist we were able to attenuate the ethanol-associated reduction and apoptosis of 5-HT and rhombencephalic neurons. The downstream pro-survival effects of 5-HT1A stimulation were associated with the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'kinase (PI-3K) and its subsequent up-regulation of specific NF-KB-dependent pro-survival genes. Using an in vitro model, we investigated the hypothesis that S100B, a protein which is released from astrocytes following 5-HT1A agonist stimulation, can reduce apoptosis in ethanol-treated rat fetal rhombencephalic neurons. We also evaluated whether the ariti-apoptotic effects of S100B on fetal rhombencephalic neurons were linked to the activation of the PI-3K -> pAkt pro-survival pathway and the expression of two NF-KB-dependent pro-survival genes: XIAP and Bc1-2. Moreover, we determined whether S100B's pro-survival effects were associated with mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK)-> p42/p44 MAPK. The results of these investigations demonstrated that S100B treatment prevented ethanol-associated apoptosis of fetal rhombencephalic neurons. In addition, it appears that these neuroprotective effects are linked to activation of the PI-3K pathways, because the PI-3K inhibitor LY294002 blocks the neuroprotective effects of S100B. Moreover, S100B increases the formation of pAkt and the up-regulation of two downstream NF-KB-dependent pro-survival genes: XIAP and Bcl-2. Although the MAPKK inhibitor PD98059 reduced the number of surviving neurons in S100B-treated cultures, S100B did not activate MAPKK.
