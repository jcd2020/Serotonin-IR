	Full quantification of a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand binding to its target is preferred because it requires the fewest assumptions, but generally involves measuring the concentration of free radioligand in the arterial plasma by collecting blood samples from the subject's radial artery during the scan, and performing metabolite analysis. This invasive, costly procedure deters subjects' participation, and requires specialized staff and equipment. Simultaneous estimation (SIME) can fully quantify binding using only PET data from multiple brain regions and one individual anchor value, which is based on a single arterial blood sample. Drawing this sample can still be challenging in clinical settings, particularly when using simultaneous PET/magnetic resonance scanners. Here we propose a methodology for full quantification of binding that does not require any blood samples. The methodology substitutes the SIME blood-based anchor with a value predicted using multiple linear regression of noninvasive, easy-to-collect variables related to the radioligand blood concentration, and individual metabolism, such as injected dose, body mass index, or body surface area. As a study case, we show here the methodology in comparison to analysis with full arterial-line blood sampling in a cohort of 23 available scans with [(11)C]CUMI-101, a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors.
