	Selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists enhance the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on presynaptic 5-HT function, and have potential as antidepressant augmentation therapies. The present study tested the effect of different selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists (WAY 100635, NAD-299, p-MPPI and LY 426965) in combination with a SSRI (paroxetine), on postsynaptic 5-HT function measured by increased expression of the immediate early gene, Arc. Paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.) combined with WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg s.c.) increased Arc mRNA in frontal, parietal and piriform cortices, and caudate putamen. Paroxetine (5 mg/kg. s.c.) plus NAD-299 (1 or 5 mg/kg s.c.) had a similar effect.: None of these drugs increased Arc mRNA when administered alone. Paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.) plus p-MPPI (8.5 mg/kg s.c.) also increased Arc mRNA but p-MPPI itself elevated Arc, mRNA in many regions. Whilst LY 426965 (3 or 10 mg/kg s.c.) had no effect alone, when combined with paroxetine (5 mg/kg s.c.), the drug increased Arc mRNA in caudate putamen but not cortical regions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that four 5-HT1A receptor antagonists augment the effect of an SSRI on Arc mRNA expression, which is suggestive of increased postsynaptic 5-HT function. However, the data reveal certain differences in the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists not recognised in models of presynaptic 5-HT function. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
