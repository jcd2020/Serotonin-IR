Lopez-Rodriguez, M. L., et al. (1999). "Benzimidazole derivatives. Part 1: Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of new benzimidazole-4-carboxamides and carboxylates as potent and selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists." Bioorg Med Chem 7(11): 2271-2281.

	New benzimidazole-4-carboxamides 1-16 and -carboxylates 17-26 were synthesized and evaluated for binding affinity at serotonergic 5-HT4 and 5-HT3 receptors in the CNS. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited moderate-to-very high affinity (in many cases subnanomolar) for the 5-HT4 binding site and no significant affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor. SAR observations and structural analyses (molecular modeling, INSIGHT II) indicated that the presence of a voluminous substituent in the basic nitrogen atom of the amino moiety and a distance of ca. 8.0 A from this nitrogen to the aromatic ring are of great importance for high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT4 receptors. These results confirm our recently proposed model for recognition by the 5-HT4 binding site. Amides 12-15 and esters 24 and 25 bound at central 5-HT4 sites with very high affinity (Ki = 0.11-2.9 nM) and excellent selectivity over serotonin 5-HT3, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT1A receptors (Ki > 1000-10,000 nM). Analogues 12 (Ki(5-HT4) = 0.32 nM), 13 (Ki(5-HT4) = 0.11 nM), 14 (Ki(5-HT4) = 0.29 nM) and 15 (Ki(5-HT4) = 0.54 nM) were pharmacologically characterized as selective 5-HT4 antagonists in the isolated guinea pig ileum (pA2 = 7.6, 7.9, 8.2 and 7.9, respectively), with a potency comparable to the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS 39604 (pA2 = 8.2). The benzimidazole-4-carboxylic acid derivatives described in this paper represent a novel class of potent and selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonists. In particular, compounds 12-15 could be interesting pharmacological tools for the understanding of the role of 5-HT4 receptors.
