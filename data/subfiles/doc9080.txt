	In the present study we examined the effect of prolonged treatment with cocaine (a sensitization and discrimination paradigm) on the expression of serotonin (5-HT)(1B) receptors in rat brain structures using a quantitative autoradiographic analysis. To estimate the distribution of 5-HT1B receptors in several brain coronal sections, we used [N-methyl-H-3]GR 125743, a 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist, in the presence of ketanserin (a drug used to block 5-HT1D receptors). The binding of [N-methyl-H-3]GR 125743 in the areas containing dopamine cell bodies (the ventral tegmental area. the substantia nigra) and terminals (the nucleus accumbens shell and core, but not in the caudate-putamen) and in the subiculum of the hippocampus was increased after withdrawal from repeated cocaine in both the discrimination and the sensitization paradigms. either being effective as confirmed by behavioral experiments. Neither acute cocaine injection nor the psychostimulant challenge following its repeated administration affected the binding of [N-methyl-H-3]GR 125743 in the above brain areas. Our results indicate that withdrawal front chronic cocaine induces up-regulation of 5-HT1B receptors in a number of rat brain structures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
