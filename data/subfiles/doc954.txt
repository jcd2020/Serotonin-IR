	Animal and human pharmacological studies indicate that the antipsychotic action of cyamemazine results from blockade of dopamine D, receptors, its anxiolytic properties from serotonin 5-HT2c receptor antagonism and the low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects from a potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic action. Cyamemazine is metabolized in monodesmethyl cyamemazine and cyamemazine sulfoxide, which are not known for their affinities for serotonin, dopamine and other brain receptor types considered to mediate central nervous systems effects of drugs. Hence, metabolite affinities were determined in human recombinant receptors expressed in CHO cells (hD(2) and hD4.4 receptors, h5-HT1A, h5-HT2A, h5-HT2C and h5-HT7 receptors and hM(1), hM(2), and hM(3) receptors) and HEK-293 cells (h5-HT3 receptors) or natively present in rat cerebral cortex (non-specific alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors) and guinea pig cerebellum (H-1 central histamine receptors) membranes. Monodesmethyl cyamemazine showed a neurotransmitter receptor profile similar to that of its parent compound cyamemazine, i.e.: high affinity for h5-HT2A receptors (K-i = 1.5 nM), h5-HT2C receptors (K-i = 12 nM) and hD(2) receptors (K-i = 12 nM). Cyamemazine sulfoxide showed high affinity for h5-HT2A receptors (K-i=39 nM) and histamine H, receptors (K-i=15 nM) and a reduced affinity for D-2 and 5-HT2C receptors. Therefore, monodesmethyl cyamemazine can contribute to enhance and prolong the therapeutic actions of cyamemazine. Further investigation is required to see if the high affinities of cyamemazine sulfoxide for H, and 5-HT2A receptors are of therapeutic benefit against sleep onset insomnia and/or sleep maintenance insomnia respectively.
