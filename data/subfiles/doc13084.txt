Veelken, R., et al. (1993). "A HIGHLY SELECTIVE CARDIORENAL SEROTONERGIC 5-HT3-MEDIATED REFLEX IN RATS." American Journal of Physiology 264(6): H1871-H1877.

	To elucidate whether prolonged stimulation of cardiopulmonary serotonergic (5-HT3) receptors could play a role in the control of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA), we compared 15-min intravenous infusions to bolus administrations of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist phenyl biguanide (PBG) and to a 0.9% saline load (5% body wt) in rats. Short-term and prolonged stimulation of 5-HT3-sensitive cardiopulmonary reflexes caused dose-related decreases in RSNA but not in lumbar sympathetic nerve activity (LSNA); only short-term stimulation caused decreases in blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Saline loading lowered RSNA but not LSNA, BP, or HR. Baroreceptor denervation did not influence any of these responses. Scopolamine attenuated BP and HR but not RSNA responses to bolus PBG. Pretreatment with a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist inhibited responses to PBG but not to saline. Vagotomy abolished all responses to all interventions. Thus 1) the prolonged stimulation of cardiopulmonary 5-HT3 receptors caused sustained suppression of RSNA, 2) decreased BP and HR were manifest only during short-term stimulation (3 min), and 3) blockade of 5-HT3 receptors did not influence responses to cardiopulmonary mechanoreceptor stimulation.
