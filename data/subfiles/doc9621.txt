Odagaki, Y. and R. Toyoshima (2005). "5-HT1A receptor-mediated G protein activation assessed by S-35 GTP gamma S binding in rat cerebral cortex." Eur J Pharmacol 521(1-3): 49-58.

	To date, 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor-mediated functional assays (adenylyl cyclase inhibition, high-affinity GTPase activity and [S-35]guanosine-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-tripbosphate ([S-35]GTP gamma S) binding) have been performed mainly in hippocampal membranes. In the current study, 5-HT-stimulated G protein activation assays were carried out in rat cerebral cortical membranes. High-affinity GTPase activity was stimulated by 5-HT, but not by 8-bydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetratin (8-OH-DPAT). By contrast, 5-HT- and 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding displayed sufficient dynamic range enough to warrant further phan-nacological analysis. Under standard conditions, which were determined precisely in terms of the concentrations of GDP, MgCl2 and NaCl, the profile of 5-HT-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding investigated using a series of 5-HT receptor agonists and antagonists clearly indicated the involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor subtype. There appeared to be no evidence supporting the presence of regional heterogeneity in coupling efficiency between 5-HT1A and G proteins in the hippocampus or cortex. This method is a useful tool for investigating functional coupling between postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors and G proteins in cerebral cortical membranes. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
