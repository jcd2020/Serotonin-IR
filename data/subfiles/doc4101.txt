Gupta, R., et al. (2008). "3-Nitropropionic acid-induced depression of spinal reflexes does not involve 5-hydroxytryptaminergic system in contrast to ischemia-induced depression in neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro." Neuroscience Letters 446(2-3): 93-96.

	The involvement of 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (5-HTergic) system for the 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)-induced depression of spinal reflexes was evaluated and compared with other energy deficiency condition (ischemia; glucose-free and O-2-free). The monosynaptic (MSR) and polysynaptic reflex (PSR) potentials were recorded at ventral root by stimulating the corresponding dorsal root in neonatal rat spinal cord in vitro. Superfusion of 3-NPA(3.4 mM) or ischemic solution depressed the reflexes in a time-dependent manner abolishing them by 35 min. Pretreatment with pindolol (1 mu M), ketanserin (10 mu M) or ondansetron (0.1 mu M): 5-HT1, 5-HT2, or 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, respectively, did not block the 3-NPA-induced depression of reflexes whereas, ischemia-induced depression was blocked by ondansetron. 5-HT content of the spinal cords incubated with 3-NPA (3.4 mM) for 30 min was decreased significantly (33 ng/g tissue) while increased (286 ng/g) in cords exposed to ischemic solution as compared to saline-treated cords (161 ng/g). Thus, 3-NPA-induced depression of spinal reflexes does not involve 5-HTergic pathway unlike ischemia-induced depression. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
