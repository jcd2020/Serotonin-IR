Miyata, K., et al. (1993). "COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF TRIMEBUTINE AND YM114 (KAE-393), A NOVEL 5-HT3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, ON STRESS-INDUCED DEFECATION." European Journal of Pharmacology 250(2): 303-310.

	YM114 (KAE-393), (R)-5-[(2,3-dihydro-1-indolyl)carbonyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole hydrochloride, is a derivative of YM060, a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. We investigated the effects of YM114 on 5-HT3 receptors, both in vitro and in vivo, and on bowel dysfunction induced by restraint stress, 5-HT and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), and compared them with the effect of trimebutine. YM114 dose dependently inhibited the reduction in heart rate induced by 5-HT (30 mug/kg i.v.) in rats (ED50 = 0.31 mug/kg i.v.), and the potency of YM114 was almost the same as that of the racemate. The S-form of YM114 also inhibited 5-HT-induced bradycardia, but 1350 times less potent than the R-form. YM114 and its S-form inhibited [H-3]GR65630 binding to N1E-115 cell membranes in a concentration-dependent manner with K(i) values of 0.341 and 616 nM, respectively, showing the isomeric activity ratio (R-/S-form) of YM114 to be much greater (1800). YM114 antagonized 5-HT-induced depolarization of the nodose ganglion (EC50 = 1.39 nM). Trimebutine (1 mg/kg i.v.) failed to inhibit 5-HT-induced bradycardia, implying that it does not possess 5-HT3 receptor antagonistic activity. YM114 significantly and dose dependently prevented restraint stress-, 5-HT- and TRH-induced increases in fecal pellet output, and restraint stress- and 5-HT-induced diarrhea in rats and mice (ED50=6.9,72.5,154.6,9.7 and 52.4 mug/kg p.o., respectively). Trimebutine significantly prevented stress- and 5-HT-induced diarrhea (ED50 = 29.4 and 87.3 mg/ kg p.o., respectively), but only partially affected stress-, 5-HT- and TRH-induced increases in fecal pellet output. Thus, YM114 is a potent and stereoselective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with much greater protective effects against stress-induced defecation than trimebutine.
