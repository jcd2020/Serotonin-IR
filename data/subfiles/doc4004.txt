Grignaschi, G., et al. (1993). "THE HYPOPHAGIC EFFECT OF RESTRAINT STRESS IN RATS CAN BE MEDIATED BY 5-HT2 RECEPTORS IN THE PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS OF THE HYPOTHALAMUS." Neuroscience Letters 152(1-2): 103-106.

	Ritanserin (0.5 and 1 mg/kg) and ketanserin (2.5 mg/kg), two antagonists with high affinity for 5-HT2 receptors, attenuated restraint stress-induced hypophagia in rats. Two injections of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist cinanserin (30 nmol/0.5 mul) in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus completely reversed the effect of stress on food intake. (+/-)Cyanopindolol (3 and 8 mg/kg), an antagonist at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, had no effect whereas 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino)tetralin (30-300 mug/kg), an agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, significantly attenuated the hypophagia. The results suggest that restraint stress-induced hypophagia is mediated by 5-HT2 receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The potential utility of this model in anorexia nervosa is discussed.
