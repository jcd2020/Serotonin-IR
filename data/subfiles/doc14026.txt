Zhang, J., et al. (1995). "Changes in the acoustic startle response and prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle in rats after local injection of pertussis toxin into the ventral tegmental area." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 119(1): 71-78.

	The effect of local injection of pertussis toxin (PTX) into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on acoustic startle in rats was investigated. The PTX treatment caused only minor effects of its own on the acoustic startle response (ASR) or prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle. However, systemic treatment with the indirect DA receptor agonist, amphetamine (2 mg/kg, SC) caused a significant increase in ASR magnitude and a significant disruption of PPI in PTX-treated rats while no such effects were observed in sham-treated rats. Treatment with the direct DA receptor agonist, apomorphine (2 mg/kg, SC), caused a significant disruption of PPI, an effect that was observed in both PTX- and sham-treated rats. Treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, SC), did not affect PPI in either group but caused a marked increase in ASR magnitude in sham-treated rats. Interestingly, this effect was blocked in PTX-treated rats. The present results suggest that local injection of PTX into the VTA causes an increased sensitivity to the behavioural effects of psychostimulants on acoustic startle and may also suggest that intact midbrain 5-HT1A receptors are essential for the effect of 5-HT1A agonists on acoustic startle.
