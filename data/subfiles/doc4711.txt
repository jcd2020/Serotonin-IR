	AIM: To investigate the antidepressant-like effects of a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist N-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-methoxyquinoxalin-2-carboxamide (6z) in acute and chronic murine models of depression. METHODS: 5-HT3 receptor antagonism was examined in guinea pig ileum in vitro. A tail suspension test (TST) was used as acute depression model to evaluate the antidepressant-like behavior in mice treated with 6z (0.5-2 mg/kg, ip). In chronic depression model, mice were exposed to a 4-week chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) protocol, and treated with 6z (0.5-2 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), po) or a positive drug fluoxetine (10 mg.kg(-1).d(-1), po) in the last 2 weeks, followed by behavioral and biochemical assessments. RESULTS: The 5-HT3 receptor antagonism of 6z (pA2=7.4) in guinea pig ileum was more potent than that of a standard 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (pA2=6.9). In acute depression model, 6z administration significantly decreased the immobility duration. In chronic depression model, 6z administration reversed CUS-induced depressive-like behavior, as evidenced by increased immobility duration in the forced swim test and sucrose preference in the sucrose preference test. Furthermore, chronic administration of 6z prevented CUS-induced brain oxidative stress, with significant reduction of pro-oxidant markers and elevation of antioxidant enzyme activity. Moreover, chronic administration of 6z attenuated CUS-induced hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, as shown by reduced plasma corticosterone levels. Similar results were observed in the fluoxetine-treated group. CONCLUSION: 6z is a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with potential antidepressant-like activities, which may be related to modulating hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and attenuating brain oxidative damage.
