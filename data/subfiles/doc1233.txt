Bosker, F., et al. (1997). "The effects of A 5-HT1A receptor agonist and antagonist on the 5-hydroxytryptamine release in the central nucleus of the amygdala: A microdialysis study with flesinoxan and WAY 100635." Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archives of Pharmacology 355(3): 347-353.

	The modulation of extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) by 5-HT1A receptors was studied by intracerebral microdialysis in awake and freely moving rats. Local administration of 1 mu M tetrodotoxin (TTX), 60 mM K+ and perfusion with Ca2+-free Ringer containing EGTA confirmed that the major part of dialysate 5-HT levels from the CeA is of neuronal origin. Administration of 300 nM of RU 24969, a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, through the probe into the CeA decreased dialysate 5-HT levels to 67.2% of the baseline value. Systemic administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan dose-dependently decreased 5-HT levels in the CeA. The effect of 0.3 mg/kg of flesinoxan could be completely antagonized by systemic administration of 0.05 mg/kg WAY 100635, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. WAY 100635 alone had only minimal effects at this dose, These data show that a major part of the extracellular 5-HT in the CeA stems from 5-HT neurons and that the amount of 5-HT released into this brain region can be modulated by 5-HT1A receptors.
