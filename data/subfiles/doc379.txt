Arreola-Peralta, L. D., et al. (2018). "Potentiation of capsaicin-induced neurogenic inflammation by 5-HT7 receptors in the rat hind paw: Involvement of calcitonin gen-related peptide." Peptides 105: 1-6.

	A decrease in the activation threshold of primary sensory neurons to transient receptor potential V1 (TRPV1) stimulation by serotonin 5-HT7 receptors has been reported but no confirmation if this might translate into facilitation of neurogenic inflammation has been provided. We analysed the modulation of capsaicin (CAP)induced neurogenic inflammation in the rat hind paw by the selective 5-HT7 receptor agonist, LP-44, and the involvement of calcitonin gen-related peptide (CGRP) in this effect. Animals received intra-plantar injections (30 mu L) of vehicle, CAP (0.05%, 0.1% and 0.2%), LP-44 (7.5 and 15 nmol) and the combination of LP-44 + CAP; then, the time course of the inflammatory responses was measured. The effect of the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, SB-269970 (3 mg/kg, s.c.), on responses produced by LP-44 alone and combined with CAP was tested. As expected, CAP produced concentration-and time-dependent inflammatory responses in the hind paw. Interestingly, LP-44 by itself also produced inflammation in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, and magnified CAP-induced responses. Systemic pre-treatment with SB-269970 significantly blunted LP-44 (15 nmol)-induced inflammation as well as magnified inflammatory responses produced by the combination of LP-44 (7.5 and 15 nmol)+ CAP (0.1%) thus confirming the involvement of 5-HT7 receptors. Finally, the non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonist, BIBN4096 (3 mg/kg, s.c.), strongly inhibited the potentiated inflammatory responses induced by LP-44 (7.5 and 15 nmol) + CAP (0.1%) thus substantiating their neurogenic nature. Thus, sensitization of CAP-sensitive primary sensory neurons by 5-HT7 receptors may result in facilitation of neurogenic inflammation involving CGRP in the rat hind paw.
