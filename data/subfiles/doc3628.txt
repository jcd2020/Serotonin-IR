Fedotova Iu, O. (2010). "[Participation of 5-HT2A/2C AND 5-HT2A/2C subtypes of serotonergic receptors in anxiety-depressive-like behaviur of females rats in key phases of ovary cycle]." Ross Fiziol Zh Im I M Sechenova 96(4): 426-432.

	The aim of the present work was an estimation of influence of chronic administration of 5-receptors antagonist--NAN-190 (0.1 mg/kg, i. p.) and 5-HT2A/2C receptors antagonist--ketanzerine (0.1 mg/kg, i. p.) for 14 days on anxiety and depressive-like behavior in the adult female rats. Model of depression in rats was carried out in Porsolt test. Anxiety level was assessed in the elevated plus maze. It was established that chronic ketanzerine administration rendered antidepressive and anxiolytic effects in females during estrous and proestrous cycles. On the contrary, NAN-190 administration induced a more profound effect on depressive-like behavior in estrous and proestrous cycles. Also, a definite modulation of anxiety behaviour in connection with ovary cycle phases was noted: at increased level of estrogens exerted anxiolytic effect while at reduced level of estrogen--anxiogenic effect. Different extent of 5-HT subtypes receptors involvement in the mechanisms of anxiety-depressive-like behaviur at alterations of hormonal balance during ovary cycle was found. The data obtained indicate a close interaction between ovary hormonal and serotonergic systems of the brain in mechanisms of anxiety and depression.
