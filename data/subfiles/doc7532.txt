	Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in the role of serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptors in higher cognitive processes such as memory. Polymorphisms of the 5-HT6 receptor have been implicated in syndromes that affect cognition, such as schizophrenia and dementia. Manipulation of 5-HT6 receptor activity alters the transmission of several neurotransmitters important in memory: acetylcholine and glutamate, as well as dopamine, a-aminobutyric acid (GABA), epinephrine (E), and norepinephrine (NE). Several 5-HT6 antagonists have been developed, advancing the understanding of the relationship between 5-HT6 blockade and memory consolidation in diverse learning paradigms, There is also evidence that 5-HT6 receptor activity affects anxiety behaviors and may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Several clinically useful atypical antipsychotics and antidepressants have 5-HT6 affinity, but recently developed selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists may present attractive, new therapeutic options for several types of disease states.
