	Pharmacologic and genetic findings have implicated the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) in the etiology of schizophrenia. Recent studies have shown reduced 5-HT2AR levels in schizophrenia patients, yet the cause of this difference is unknown. Environmental factors, such as stress, also influence schizophrenia risk, yet little is known about how environment may affect this receptor. To determine if acute stress alters 5-HT2AR expression, we examined the effect of sleep deprivation on cortical Htr2a mRNA in mice. We found that 6 h of sleep deprivation induces a twofold increase in Htr2a mRNA, a more rapid effect than has been previously reported. This effect requires the immediate early gene early growth response 3 (Egr3), as sleep deprivation failed to induce Htr2a expression in Egr3-/- mice. These findings provide a functional link between two schizophrenia candidate genes and an explanation of how environment may influence a genetic predisposition for schizophrenia.
