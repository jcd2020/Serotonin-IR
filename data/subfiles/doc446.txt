Arvieu, L., et al. (1996). "Sumatriptan inhibits the release of CGRP and substance P from the rat spinal cord." Neuroreport 7(12): 1973-1976.

	THE possible presynaptic action of the anti-migraine drug sumatriptan on primary afferent fibres containing substance P and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide was investigated on superfused rat horizontal spinal cord slices with attached dorsal roots. Electrical stimulation of dorsal roots triggered a significant overflow of both peptides; this could be reduced by sumatriptan in a concentration-dependent manner. As expected from the involvement of 5-HT1B/(1D beta) receptors, methiothepin, (-)tertatolol and GR 127,935, but not WAY 100,635, prevented the inhibitory effect of sumatriptan. These data support the idea that the anti-migraine action of sumatriptan may involve, at least in part, a presynaptic inhibitory control of nociceptive (trigeminovascular) substance P- and/or calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing sensory fibres.
