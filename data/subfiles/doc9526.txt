	Within the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), serotonin (5-HT) exerts modulatory effects on central mechanisms controlling autonomic functions, notably through the stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors. Using double immunocytochemical labeling with specific anti-5-HT2A receptor antibodies and antibodies directed against the catecholamine (CA) synthesizing enzymes, i.e. tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, we investigated whether 5-HT effects could be mediated by 5-HT2A receptors located on CA perikarya and/or processes within the NTS. A relatively high density of 5-HT2A immunoreactive processes was observed throughout the NTS. 5-HT2A neuronal perikarya were also found within the NTS except in its rostrolateral part. Double immunolabeling experiments revealed many 5-HT2A receptors on CA processes but only few 5-HT2A/TH and 5-HT2A/DBH perikarya. These data support the idea that, within the NTS, 5-HT2A-mediated control of autonomic functions involves CA neurons.
