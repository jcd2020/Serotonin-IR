del Olmo, E., et al. (1998). "Early localization of mRNA coding for 5-HT1A receptors in human brain during development." Brain Res Mol Brain Res 60(1): 123-126.

	The distribution of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in the human brain was studied in neonatal, children and adult cases by means of in situ hybridization histochemistry, using an oligonucleotide derived from the coding region of the human receptor. A prenatal pattern of development was observed. The hippocampus, raphe nuclei and neocortex presented high levels of hybridization already at the fetal/neonatal stage, fully comparable to the adult. A high and transient hybridization signal was found in cerebellum. These results support a role for 5-HT1A receptors in the regulation of neural development.
