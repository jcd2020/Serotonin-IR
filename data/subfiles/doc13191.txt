Vizuete, M. L., et al. (1997). "Expression of 5-HT7 receptor mRNA in rat brain during postnatal development." Neurosci Lett 227(1): 53-56.

	The present study is the first one to demonstrate the expression of 5-HT7 receptor mRNA by in situ hybridization during postnatal development. No quantitative developmental changes in the 5-HT7 gene expression was observed in neocortex, pyramidal layers of CA1 and CA2, dentate gyrus, most of thalamic nuclei, mammillary region, superior colliculus and central gray. However, in retrosplenial cortex, subiculum and medial habenula an increase of labeling is observed between postnatal days (PN) PN15 and PN21. Striatum showed a transient expression during the first stages of development to be undetectable in adults. CA3 pyramidal cell layer, intramediodorsal thalamic nucleus and lateral habenula displayed a high mRNA expression at PN5 and PN8 which decreased throughout development but it was still present in adults. A possible non-neurotransmitter trophic function of 5-HT mediated through 5-HT7 receptors could be suggested.
