	The present study observed the expression of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (1A) receptor mRNA in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn neurons following carrageenan inflammation using in situ hybridization (ISH). We also studied the co-localization of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) or enkephalin (ENK) immunoreactivities using a combined fluorescent ISH and immunofluoreseent histochemical double-staining technique. The finding of this study demonstrated that 5-HT1A receptor mRNA was widely distributed in the spinal dorsal horn with the highest density in laminae III-VI. Following carrageenan-induced inflammation, the 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression in all layers of ipsilateral dorsal horn was significantly enhanced. and the peak occurred after 8 h. Furthermore, the number of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA and GABA or ENK immunoreactive double-labeled cells was also markedly increased 8 h after carrageenan injection. These findings suggested that following peripheral inflammation, the synthesis of 5-HT1A receptor was increased in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn neurons, especially in spinal GABA and ENK neurons.
