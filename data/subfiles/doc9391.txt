Nic Dhonnchadha, B. A., et al. (2003). "Evidence for a 5-HT2A receptor mode of action in the anxiolytic-like properties of DOI in mice." Behav Brain Res 147(1-2): 175-184.

	DOI [(+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane] displays a high affinity for the rat 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors (pKi 7.3, 7.4 and 7.8, respectively) and acts as an agonist. DOI (0.5-4 mg/kg, i.p. 30 min pre-test) increased the number of punished passages in the mouse four plates test (FPT). The anti-punishment action of DOI (1 mg/kg, i.p. 30 min pre-test) was abolished by prior treatment with the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist SR 46949B (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p. 45 min pre-test) but not by the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS 10-2221 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p. 45 min pre-test) nor the selective 5-HT2C/2B receptor antagonist SB 206553 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p. 45 min pre-test). An anxiolytic-like action was also observed for DOI (1 mg/kg) in the elevated plus maze (EPM). The anxiolytic-like action of DOI (1 mg/kg, i.p. 30 min pre-test) was antagonised by pre-treatment with SR 46949B (0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg, i.p. 45 min pre-test) but not by RS 10-2221 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p. 45 min pre-test) nor SB 206553 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, i.p. 45 min pre-test). In conclusion, DOI produced an anxiolytic-like profile in the mouse FPT and EPM. These effects are likely to be 5-HT2A receptor mediated.
