	Chronic stressful life events are risk factors for contracting depression, the pathophysiology of which is strongly associated with impairments in serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission. Indeed, in rodents, exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) produces depressive-like behaviours such as behavioural despair and anhedonia. To date, there have not been many studies that especially explore in vivo changes in 5-HT neurotransmission associated with CUS in the rat. Therefore, using in vivo electrophysiology, we evaluated whether CUS that induces anhedonia-like behaviours concurrently impairs midbrain raphe 5-HT neuronal activity. Unlike unstressed and acutely stressed rats, CUS produced progressive reductions in sucrose intake and preference (anhedonia-like). These were associated with a decrease in the spontaneous firing activity (35.4%) as well as in the number of spontaneously active 5-HT neurons, and a desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe. These results suggest that CUS dramatically decreases 5-HT neural activity and 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity, and may represent endophenotypic features of depressive-like states.
