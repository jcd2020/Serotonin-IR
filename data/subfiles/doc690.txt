	During hypoxia, red-eared slider turtles increase ventilation and decrease episodic breathing, but whether these responses are due to central mechanisms is not known. To test this question, isolated adult turtle brainstems were exposed to 240 min of hypoxic solution (bath PO(2) = 32.6 ± 1.2 mmHg) and spontaneous respiratory-related motor bursts (respiratory event) were recorded on hypoglossal nerve roots. During hypoxia, burst frequency increased during the first 15 min, and then decreased during the remaining 35-240 min of hypoxia. Burst amplitude was maintained for 120 min, but then decreased during the last 120 min. The number of bursts/respiratory event decreased within 30 min and remained decreased. Pretreatment with either prazosin (α(1)-adrenergic antagonist) or MDL7222 (5-HT(3) antagonist) blocked the hypoxia-induced short-term increase and the longer duration decrease in burst frequency. MDL7222, but not prazosin, blocked the hypoxia-induced decrease in bursts/respiratory event. Thus, during bath hypoxia, isolated turtle brainstems continued to produce respiratory motor output, but the frequency and pattern were altered in a manner that required endogenous α(1)-adrenergic and serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor activation. This is the first example of isolated reptile brainstems exhibiting central hypoxic chemosensitivity similar to other vertebrate species.
