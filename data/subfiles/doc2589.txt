	Galanin-like peptide (GALP) is a hypothalamic neuropeptide that has been implicated in the control of feeding, metabolism, and reproduction. The goal of this study was to examine the effects of central infusions of GALP on GnRH and LH secretion and to identify physiological factors that influence the expression of GALP mRNA in the brain of a primate species. Infusions of GALP into the lateral cerebroventricle of the macaque caused a significant increase in LH secretion, which was blocked by administration of the GnRH receptor antagonist acyline. However, the expression of GALP mRNA in the arcuate nucleus, as determined by in situ hybridization, was not regulated by either estradiol or progesterone. Compared with feeding ad libitum, fasting for 48 h produced a significant reduction in the hypothalamic expression of GALP mRNA. GALP neurons were found to express both neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor and serotonin 2C receptor by double-label in situ hybridization. Taken together, these results suggest that GALP neurons play a role of integrating metabolic signals, which are relayed to circuits controlling GnRH release in the macaque.
