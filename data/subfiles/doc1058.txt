Bhatnagar, S. and C. Vining (2004). "Pituitary-adrenal activity in acute and chronically stressed male and female mice lacking the 5-HT-3A receptor." Stress 7(4): 251-256.

	The serotonin (5-HT)-3A receptor has been localized in limbic and brainstem structures that regulate hypothalamic--pituitary--adrenal (HPA) activity. We previously showed that 5-HT-3A receptor knock-out (KO) male mice displayed lower ACTH responses to acute restraint or lipopolysaccharide administration compared to age-matched wild-type (WT) males. In the present study, we found that pituitary-adrenal responses to acute stress were not different in female WT and KO mice. Furthermore, we examined the role of the 5-HT-3A receptor in regulation of chronic stress-induced HPA activity in both male and female WT and KO mice. The results show that ACTH, but not corticosterone, responses to novel restraint are lower in chronically cold stressed females compared to non-stressed control females but no effect of 5-HT-3A receptor deletion was observed. In contrast, male mice showed facilitated responses to novel restraint after chronic cold stress and this facilitation produced sex differences in ACTH responses to novel restraint between male and female chronically stressed KO mice. Together, these results indicate that there are sex differences in HPA responses to novel restraint in chronically stressed mice and these differences are partly related to 5-HT-3A receptor function.
