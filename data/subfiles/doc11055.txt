Routledge, C., et al. (1995). "Differential effects of WAY-100135 on the decrease in 5-hydroxytryptamine release induced by buspirone and NAN-190." Eur J Pharmacol 276(3): 281-284.

	1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-4-[(phthalimido)butyl] piperazine (NAN-190) and 8-[4-[4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl]butyl]-8-azaspiro[4.5] decane-7,9-dione (buspirone) are 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists which decrease 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release in vivo. In order to assess whether these ligands decrease 5-HT release by stimulating 5-HT1A receptors we examined the ability of the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-tert-butyl 3-4-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazin-1-yl-2-phenylpropanamide dihydrochloride (WAY-100135) to block their inhibitory effects on 5-HT. NAN-190 (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) and buspirone (1.0 mg/kg s.c.) significantly decreased extracellular levels of 5-HT in hippocampal dialysates. WAY-100135 (10.0 mg/kg s.c.) attenuated the effect of buspirone but had no significant effect on the NAN-190-induced decreased in 5-HT release. These data demonstrate that buspirone is an agonist at the somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptor but that the inhibitory effects of NAN-190 on 5-HT release may be mediated via a mechanism other than, or in addition to, 5-HT1A receptor agonism.
