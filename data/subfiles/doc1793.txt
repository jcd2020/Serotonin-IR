Chaouloff, F., et al. (1995). "Cortical [3H]ketanserin binding and 5-HT2A receptor-mediated behavioral responses in obese Zucker rats." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 50(2): 309-312.

	Past studies have indicated that genetically obese Zucker (fa/fa) rats are hypercorticoid, and that this neuroendocrine alteration plays a key role in the syndrome. In keeping with the proposal that glucocorticoids may upregulate central 5-HT2A receptors, we have studied the effects of acute and repeated 5-HT2A receptor stimulation by 1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) in lean and obese Zucker rats. Acute injection of DOI (2 mg/kg, SC) elicited a lower number of head shakes in obese rats compared to that measured in lean rats. Conversely, neither DOI-elicited decreases in food intakes and body weights nor cortical [3H]ketanserin binding were affected by obesity. In rats repeatedly pretreated with DOI, biochemical and functional indices of 5-HT2A receptor downregulation failed to reveal an effect of obesity. It is suggested that 5-HT2A receptor-mediated functions, but not their downregulation, may be differentially affected in the hypercorticoid obese Zucker rat.
