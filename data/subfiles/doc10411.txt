Przegalinski, E., et al. (1990). "REPEATED TREATMENT WITH IMIPRAMINE, AMITRIPTYLINE OR ELECTROCONVULSIVE SHOCK DOES NOT AFFECT THE 8-OH-DPAT-INDUCED INCREASE IN FOOD-INTAKE IN FREE FEEDING RATS." Pol J Pharmacol Pharm 42(4): 327-332.

	We studied the effect of repeated treatment with imipramine, amitriptyline (10 mg/kg po, twice daily for 14 days) or electroconvulsive shock (ECS, once daily for 10 days) on the 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylmaino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)-induced increase in food intake in free feeding rats. The response to 8-OH-DPAT, measured 24 h after the last administration of the antidepressant drugs or ECS, was not modified. These results, together with literature data, indicate that the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors involved in the 8-OH-DPAT-induced feeding are not affected by long-term antidepressant administration.
