	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of the serotonergic nervous system on motor behaviors mediated by cerebellar fastigial nucleus (FN). METHODS: In this experiment, the main methods are whole-cell patch clamp recording and Rota-rod test. RESULTS: We found that the excitatory synaptic transmission was enhanced in the cerebella FN after blocking 5-hydroxytryptamine,(5-HT)receptor. Microinjection of 5-HT into FNs remarkably promoted motor performances on Rota-rod, which could be reversed by microinjection of 5-HT receptor antagonist SB224289. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the 5-HT can suppress cerebellar FN excitatory synaptic transmission via 5-HT1B receptors, thereby modulate the activity of cerebellar nuclear neurons circuitry, and subsequently influence the cerebellum-mediated ongoing motor balance and coordination.
