	To further investigate the efficacy of 5-HT1A receptor agonism on functional and histological outcome in traumatically-brain injured (TBI) rats, a single intraperitoneal injection of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) or vehicle was given 15 min after controlled cortical impact or sham injury. Function was assessed by established motor and cognitive tests on post-operative days 1-5 and 14-18, respectively. Cortical lesion volume and hippocampal CA(1)/CA(3) cell survival were quantified at 4 weeks. The administration of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg) attenuated spatial acquisition deficits and reduced hippocampal CA(3) cell loss vs. vehicle (P < 0.05). These data augment published reports that 5-HT1A receptor agonists confer neuroprotective effects after experimental TBI. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
