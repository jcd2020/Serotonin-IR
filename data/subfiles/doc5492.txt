Kaufman, M. J., et al. (1995). "SEROTONIN 5-HT2C RECEPTOR STIMULATES CYCLIC-GMP FORMATION IN CHOROID-PLEXUS." Journal of Neurochemistry 64(1): 199-205.

	The serotonin 5-HT2C receptor (formerly designated the 5-HT1C receptor) of the choroid plexus triggers phosphoinositide turnover. In the present study, we demonstrate that receptor activation also triggers the formation of cyclic GMP (cGMP). Application of 1 mu M 5-HT to porcine choroid plexus tissue slices resulted in stimulation of cGMP formation to a maximum of five-fold basal level, with an EC(50) of 11 nM. This response was not inhibited by muscarinic or beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists. Serotonin receptor antagonists inhibited cGMP formation with apparent K-i values of 1.3 (mianserin), 200 (ketanserin), and 5,500 (spiperone) nM, respectively. Neither serotonin-stimulated cGMP formation nor PI turnover was inhibited by pertussis toxin pretreatment. Preliminary biochemical studies suggested that serotonin-stimulated cGMP formation was calcium, phospholipase A(2), and lipoxygenase dependent, as incubation in low calcium buffers or inclusion of the phospholipase A(2) or lipoxygenase inhibitors p-bromophenacyl bromide or BW 755c resulted in significant reduction of cGMP formation. The present results suggest that in addition to triggering phosphoinositide turnover, choroid plexus serotonin 5-HT2C receptors trigger cGMP formation in a calcium-sensitive manner.
