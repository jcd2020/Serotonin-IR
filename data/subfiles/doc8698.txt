	1 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are thought to have a delay in therapeutic efficacy because of the need to overcome the inhibitory influence of raphe 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Prolonged SSRI administration has been reported to desensitize these autoreceptors. We have used [S-35]-GTPgammaS autoradiography to determine whether this desensitization occurs at the level of receptor/G protein coupling. 2 Male mice were injected intraperitoneally once a day with saline or 20 mg kg(-1) fluoxetine for either 2 days or 14 days. 5-HT1A receptor binding and coupling to G proteins were assessed using [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT and [S-35]-GTPgammaS autoradiography, respectively. 3 The 5-HT receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) stimulated [S-35]-GTPgammaS binding in the substantia nigra, as well as in hippocampus and dorsal raphe nucleus. The 5-HT1A receptor antagonist p-MPPF (4-fluoro-N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)l-piperazinyl]ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)benzamide) blocked this effect in the latter regions, whereas the 5-HT1B/D antagonist GR-127,935 (2'methyl-4'-(5-methyl-[1,2,4]oxadiazol-3-yi)-biphenyl-4-carboxylic acid [4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-phenyl]-amide) only decreased labelling in substantia nigra. 4 Fourteen-day fluoxetine treatment decreased 5-CT-stimulated [S-35]-GTPgammaS binding in dorsal raphe (saline: 112+/-12% stimulation, fluoxetine: 66+/-13%), but not in substantia nigra (99+/-14% vs 103+/-7%) or hippocampus (157+/-3% vs 148+/-18%). Two-day fluoxetine treatment did not alter 5-CT-stimulated [S-35]-GTPgammaS binding in any of the brain areas investigated. 5 Decreased [S-35]-GTPgammaS binding was not due to receptor down-regulation, since the density of raphe [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT binding sites was unaffected by fluoxetine treatment. 6 These results suggest that the desensitization of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor function occurs at the level of receptor-G protein interaction on dorsal raphe neurons, and may underlie the therapeutic efficacy of long-term SSRI treatment.
