Alvarez-Guerra, M., et al. (2000). "5-HT3- and 5-HT2C-antagonist properties of cyamemazine: significance for its clinical anxiolytic activity." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 147(4): 412-417.

	RATIONALE: Cyamemazine is a neuroleptic compound which possesses anxiolytic properties in humans. On the other hand, 5-HT3- and 5-HT2C-receptors have been implicated in anxiety disorders and a previous binding study has shown that cyamemazine possesses high affinity for both serotonin receptor types. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to establish whether cyamemazine antagonizes 5-HT3- and/or 5-HT2C-mediated responses, and whether it compares with reference compounds. METHODS: Cyamemazine was tested for its ability to antagonize: (i) 5-HT3-dependent contraction of the isolated guinea-pig ileum and bradycardic responses in the rat and (ii) 5-HT2C-dependent phospholipase C (PLC) stimulation in rat brain membranes. RESULTS: In isolated guinea-pig ileum, cyamemazine potently and competitively antagonized 5-HT-dependent contractions (pA2 = 7.52 +/- 0.08; n = 5). In this test, cyamemazine was 5-7 times more potent (pIC50 = 6.75 +/- 0.13) than tropisetron (pIC50 = 6.02 +/- 0.04). In rats, cyamemazine i.v. antagonized 5-HT-dependent bradycardic responses with ID50% = 3.2 +/- 1.5 mg/kg (n = 4). Finally, in rat brain membranes cyamemazine antagonized 5-HT2C-dependent PLC stimulation with Ki = 424 nM (mianserin exhibits a Ki = 113 nM). CONCLUSIONS: Cyamemazine behaves as an antagonist at both 5-HT3- and 5-HT2C-receptors, which compares well with reference compounds. These 5-HT3- and 5-HT2C-antagonistic actions of cyamemazine can be involved, at least in part, in its beneficial therapeutic actions in anxiety disorders.
