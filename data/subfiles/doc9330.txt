	Previous studies have shown that the activation of 5-HT3 receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) increases the baseline mean arterial pressure (MAP). In the present study, we evaluated the possible involvement of NMDA receptors in this pressor response. Four days before the experiments, under tribromoethanol anesthesia, rats received two guide cannulas in the direction of the NTS, and 1 day before the experiments, under tribromoethanol anesthesia, the femoral artery was cannulated for pulsatile arterial pressure (PAP), MAP, and heart rate (HR) measurements. On the day of the experiments, 2-methyl-serotonin, a 5-HT3 agonist, was microinjected into the NTS after microinjection of saline or AP-5, a selective NMDA receptor antagonist. Microinjection of 2-methyl-serotonin (5 nmol/50 nl) into the NTS after the vehicle (saline) produced a significant increase in MAP (+ 20 +/- 5 mm Hg, n = 8) while microinjection of 2-methyl-serotonin after microinjection of AP-5 (10 nmol/50 nl) produced no change in baseline MAP (-1 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 11). Microinjection of AP-5 into the NTS produced no significant changes in the baseline MAP and HR. The data show that the increase in MAP in response to microinjection of a 5-HT3 agonist into the NTS is dependent on NMDA receptors.
