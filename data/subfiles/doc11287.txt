Saphier, D. and J. E. Welch (1994). "5-HT3 RECEPTOR ACTIVATION IN THE RAT INCREASES ADRENOCORTICAL SECRETION AT THE LEVEL OF THE CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM." Neuroscience Research Communications 14(3): 167-173.

	Central (intracerebroventricular, i.c.v.) and peripheral (intraperitoneal, i.p.) administration of the serotonin, (5-HT3) receptor agonist, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (m-CPBG) was found to increase adrenocortical secretion in conscious male rats. The effects of both i.c.v. and i.p. administration of m-CPBG were largely prevented by i.c.v. administration of the 5-HT3 antagonist, 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (MDL-72222). However, i.p. injections of MDL-72222 were only partially effective in blocking the increases in plasma corticosterone (CS) concentrations produced by m-CPBG, suggesting a relative lack of ability of the antagonist to penetrate the blood-brain barrier to the effector sites. The data obtained indicate that the predominant site of action of 5-HT3 agonists in increasing adrenocortical secretion lies within the central nervous system.
