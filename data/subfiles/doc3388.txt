	The effects of pindolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker/putative 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A/1B) antagonist, on both the single-unit activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and extracellular 5-HT levels in the caudate nucleus, were examined in freely moving cats. Administration of (+/-)-pindolol (1 and 10 mg/kg, s.c.) decreased neuronal activity and increased 5-HT levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The subsequent administration of WAY-100635 {N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide} (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.), a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, blocked pindolol-induced neuronal suppression and potentiated 5-HT output. These results indicate that pindolol may be acting at the level of the nerve terminal to increase 5-HT. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
