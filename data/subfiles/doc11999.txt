	The present study investigated a possible antidepressant-like activity of hesperidin using two predictive tests for antidepressant effect in mice: the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). Results demonstrated that hesperidin (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.) decreased the immobility time in the FST and TST without affecting the locomotor activity in the open field test The antidepressant-like effect of hesperidin (0.3 mg/kg) on the TST was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (pCPA; 100 mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis) and WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous, s.c., a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist). Pretreatment of mice with prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(1)-radrenoceptor antagonist), yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.p., a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), AMPT (100 mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of tyrosine hydroxylase), SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., a dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist), sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p., a dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist), ketanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist) or MDL72222 (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist) did not block the antidepressant-like effect of hesperidin (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) in the TST. Administration of hesperidin (0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) and fluoxetine (1 mg/kg), at subeffective doses, produced an antidepressant-like effect in the TST. The antidepressant-like effect caused by hesperidin in mice in the TST was dependent on an interaction with the serotonergic 5-HT-(1A) receptors. Taken together, these results suggest that hesperidin possesses antidepressant-like property and may be of interest source for therapeutic agent for the treatment of depressive disorders.
