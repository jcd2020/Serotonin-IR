Scrogin, K. E. (2003). "5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT acts in the hindbrain to reverse the sympatholytic response to severe hemorrhage." Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 284(3): R782-791.

	Central administration of serotonergic 5-HT1A receptor agonists delays the reflex sympatholytic response to severe hemorrhage in conscious rats. To determine the region where 5-HT1A receptor agonists act to mediate this response, recovery of mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) was compared in hemorrhaged rats after injection of the selective 5-HT1A agonist, (+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), in various regions of the cerebroventricular system or the systemic circulation. Three minutes after injection of 8-OH-DPAT (48 nmol/kg), MAP and RSNA were higher in hemorrhaged rats given drug in the fourth ventricle (94 +/- 5 mmHg, 82 +/- 18% of baseline) or the systemic circulation (90 +/- 4 mmHg, 113 +/- 15% of baseline) than in rats given drug in the Aqueduct of Sylvius (63 +/- 4 mmHg, 27 +/- 11% of baseline), the lateral ventricle (42 +/- 3 mmHg, -8 +/- 18% of baseline), or in rats given saline in various brain regions (47 +/- 5 mmHg, -42 +/- 10% of baseline). A lower-dose injection of 8-OH-DPAT (10 nmol/kg) also accelerated the recovery of MAP and RSNA in hemorrhaged rats when given in the fourth ventricle (94 +/- 26 mmHg, 72 +/- 33% of baseline 3 min after injection) but not the systemic circulation (46 +/- 4 mmHg, -25 +/- 30% of baseline). These data indicate that 8-OH-DPAT acts on receptors in the hindbrain to reverse the sympatholytic response to hemorrhage in conscious rats.
