Mele, P. C., et al. (1992). "CISPLATIN-INDUCED CONDITIONED TASTE-AVERSION - ATTENUATION BY DEXAMETHASONE BUT NOT ZACOPRIDE OR GR38032F." European Journal of Pharmacology 218(2-3): 229-236.

	The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists zacopride and GR38032F are highly effective inhibitors of emesis induced by ionizing radiation and chemotherapeutic drugs such as cisplatin. The present study evaluated zacopride and GR38032F for efficacy in inhibiting the formation of the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) induced by cisplatin or lithium chloride in rats. The glucocorticoid dexamethasone, which has been reported to be effective against both the emetic and CTA-inducing effects of cisplatin, was included as a reference compound. When administered alone by i.p. injection, zacopride (0.1-10 mg/kg), GR38032F (10 mg/kg) and cisplatin (0.32-1.8 mg/kg) induced a CTA to an 0.1% saccharin solution; lower doses of each compound were ineffective. When administered as a pretreatment, neither zacopride (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) nor GR38032F (0.01-10 mg/kg) attenuated the CTA induced by cisplatin (0.32 and 0.56 mg/kg) or lithium chloride (10 mg/kg). In contrast, dexamethasone (0.32 and 1.0 mg/kg) attenuated the CTA induced by 0.32 but not 0.56 mg/kg of cisplatin. In an attempt to evaluate higher doses of zacopride against cisplatin without the potentially confounding factor that these doses by themselves induce a CTA, rats were injected with zacopride on three separate days prior to the aversion conditioning session. This pre-exposure treatment blocked the formation of the zacopride-induced CTA, but did not improve the efficacy of zacopride in attenuating the cisplatin-induced CTA. These results suggest that neither the cisplatin- nor the lithium-induced CTA in rats are due to effects that are sensitive to 5-HT3 receptor blockade.
