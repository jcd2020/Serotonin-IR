Hamon, M., et al. (2007). "Perspectives in research of pathogenesis and therapy of affective disorders: the role of melatonin and serotonin." Zhurnal Nevrologii I Psikhiatrii Imeni S S Korsakova 107(11): 77-83.

	Over more than 40 years the research of pathogenesis of depression and elaboration of adequate medications is driven by the monoaminoergic hypothesis of serotonin, noradrenalin and, possibly, dopamine dysfunction underlying this disorder. Though the monoamine neurotransmitters mentioned above are undoubtedly involved in the development of depression, their possible deficit may be only a part of pathogenesis and other alterations of the monoamine system in the mechanism of depression should be taken into account. Research in this field will assist in the elaboration of more effective drugs with improved tolerability and more rapid effect. Currently the attention is focused on the relationship between affective disorders, including depression, and dysfunction of circadian rhythms. in this light, a role of melatonin and its receptors in depression and the data on valdoxan (agomelatine), a recently introduced antidepressant with confirmed clinical efficacy, are considered. This drug with properties of agonist melatonin and serotonin receptor 5-HT2c antagonist is a precursor of a new therapeutic approach to depression.
