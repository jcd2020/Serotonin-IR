	The serotonergic transmission is considered as a neuromodulatory system in the Central Nervous System. 5-HT1B receptors play an important role in this modulatory activity. We have purified from mammalian brain an endogenous peptide, LSAL, me called 5-HT-moduline, interacting specifically with 5-HT1B receptors. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity (K-i = 10(-10) M) and a non-competitive mechanism. Direct [H-3]5-HT-moduline binding revealed a single population of sites having an apparent affinity constant close to 10(-10) M. Autoradiographic studies showed a brain distribution of [H-3]5-HT-moduline binding sites closely related to the 5-HT1B receptors. In functional studies, the peptide is able to reverse the activity of a 5-HT1B agonist in the nanomolar range. Furthermore, this antagonist effect is also observed in vivo on mice behavior. Immunocytochemistry revealed an heterogeneous distribution of 5-HT-moduline in mouse brain, The labeled structures correspond to cellular profiles with axon-like prolongations. Moreover, in vitro, LSAL is released in a Ca++, K+-dependent manner. Therefore, 5-HT-moduline behaves as a neurotransmitter. The fact that 5-HT-moduline induces the desensitization of 5-HT1B receptors reflects the existence of a novel and efficient mechanism able to rapidly modulate the serotonergic activity.
