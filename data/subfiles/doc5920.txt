	1. A study was conducted to develop an in vitro model for examining the basal and electrical-stimulation-induced release of [3H]monoamines from chicken hyperstriatal neurones in order to demonstrate the presence of presynaptic autoreceptors for the three main monoamine transmitters: noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-HT. 2. Two sets of experiments were carried out: the first was to evaluate the effect of calcium and tetrodotoxin (TTX, sodium channel conductance inhibitor) in order to demonstrate that evoked release of monoamines was a consequence of exocytotic processes; the second to investigate the effect of selective agonists and antagonists on neurotransmitter release. 3. Ross and Cobb broiler chickens of either sex (approximately 7 to 8 weeks old) were used. Slices of hyperstriatal tissue were preincubated with [3H]noradrenaline, [3H]dopamine or [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), washed, perfused and electrically stimulated at three time points (S1, S2 and S3) which released [3H]noradrenaline, [3H]dopamine and [3H]5-HT, as determined by scintillation spectrometry. 4. When calcium was removed from, or TTX added to, the superfusion medium prior to and including the second period of electrical stimulation (S2) the evoked releases of [3H]noradrenaline, [3H]dopamine and [3H]5-HT at S2 were abolished. 5. In the presence of the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 during the S2 period, the S2/S1 ratio was lower than the control ratio due to a reduction in the stimulated release of [3H]noradrenaline. The selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist RX 821002 blocked the UK 14304-induced reduction of evoked release and the S2/S1 ratio was similar to the control ratio. 6. The D2-like receptor agonist quinpirole reduced the S2/S1 ratio for [3H]dopamine release, an effect blocked by the antagonist AJ 76. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP 94253 during S2 reduced the S2/S1 ratio due to a reduction in evoked [3H]5-HT. This effect was blocked by the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist GR 55562. 7. The results demonstrate, for the first time, the functional presence of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors, presynaptic 5-HT1B autoreceptors and presynaptic D2-like autoreceptors in broiler chicken hyperstriatal neurones in vitro.
