Fuller, R. W., et al. (1996). "Serum corticosterone increases reflect enhanced uptake inhibitor-induced elevation of extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine in rat hypothalamus." Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology 48(1): 68-70.

	The increase in extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in rat hypothalamus following administration of fluoxetine, a 5-HT-uptake inhibitor, was enhanced by the injection of LY20613 (1-[1-H-indol-4-yloxy]-3-[cyclohexylamino]-2-propanol maleate), a 5HT(1A) receptor antagonist, or by L-5-hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP), the 5-HT precursor. Elevation of serum corticosterone, measured as a functional output of hypothalamic 5-HT pathways, was greater in rats treated with fluoxetine plus LY206130 or with fluoxetine plus L-5-HTP than in rats treated with the agents alone. Synergism between effects of fluoxetine and L-5HTP has often been reported, but this is the first report of an increased functional effect when a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist is combined with a 5-HT uptake inhibitor to augment the increase in extracellular 5-HT.
