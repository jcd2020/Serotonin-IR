	We utilized 3H-8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin (3H-DPAT) and 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125I-CYP) to label serotonin (5HT) 1A and 5HT1B receptors, respectively, in sections of the rat brain after characterizing the pharmacologic specificity of these agents. We then used quantitative autoradiography to measure the concentrations of 5HT1A and 5HT1B receptors in individual subnuclei of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and adjacent structures of the dorsal vagal complex. The highest 5HT1A receptor concentrations were observed within the central and intermediate subnuclei of the NTS, with low quantities of 3H-DPAT binding sites observed in the hypoglossal nucleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. In contrast, the density of 5HT1B receptors was relatively homogeneous through all NTS subnuclei, with the highest concentrations localized within the ventrolateral subnucleus. The hypoglossal and dorsal motor nuclei had slightly higher 5HT1B receptor densities than the NTS subnuclei, whereas the area postrema had a very low density. These data suggest that 5HT1A receptors are organized in a manner consistent with the cytoarchitectural and hodological parcellation of the NTS into individual subnuclei. The high concentrations of 5HT1A receptors in the central and intermediate subnuclei suggest a role for these receptors in medullary reflex pathways subserving deglutition. The relatively high density of 5HT1B receptors in the ventrolateral subnucleus suggests that these receptors modulate respiratory neurons, whereas the diffuse organization of 5HT1B receptors in the remaining subnuclei suggests that they are associated with central 5HT afferent pathways to the NTS. Further studies will be required to understand the physiologic role of 5HT1 receptors within the NTS.
