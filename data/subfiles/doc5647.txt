Kimura, K., et al. (1991). "DUAL ACTIVATION BY LISURIDE OF CENTRAL SEROTONIN 5-HT1A AND DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR-SITES - DRUG DISCRIMINATION AND RECEPTOR-BINDING STUDIES." Behavioural Pharmacology 2(2): 105-112.

	To investigate central serotonergic (5-HT) and dopaminergic (DA) actions of lisuride, the discriminative properties of lisuride (0.05 mg/ kg, i.p.) in rats were investigated, in addition to the radioligand binding of the compound to 5-HT and DA receptor subtypes. Lisuride was found to possess high affinities for 5-HT1A receptor sites (Ki = 0.5 nM) and D2 receptor sites (Ki = 2.0 nM). The autoradiographic binding pattern of 4 nM [H-3[lisuride in rat brain showed high densities of sites displaceable by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT in hippocampus, lateral septal nucleus and amygdala, as well as those displaceable by the D2 antagonist sulpiride in striatum, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. In drug discrimination tests, the mixed, D1/D2 agonist apomorphine, the partial D2 receptor agonists (-)-3-PPP and terguride and the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT substituted for lisuride. The D1 agonist SKF38393, the D1 antagonist SCH23390, the D2 antagonist sulpiride, the 5HT1B agonist m-CPP and the 5-HT2 agonist DOI were not generalized to the lisuride cue. In antagonism tests, the D2 antagonist haloperidol and the 5-HT antagonist methysergide both induced partial but significant antagonism to the lisuride cue, but the D1 antagonist SCH23390 did not. These results indicate that discriminative stimulus properties of lisuride are mediated by the dual activation of 5-HT1A and D2 receptor sites in brain.
