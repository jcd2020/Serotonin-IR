Roerig, B., et al. (1997). "Fast synaptic signaling by nicotinic acetylcholine and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in developing visual cortex." J Neurosci 17(21): 8353-8362.

	Cholinergic and serotonergic fiber systems invade the developing visual cortex several weeks before eye opening; both transmitters have been implicated in plasticity of neocortical circuits. These transmitters have been presumed to act predominantly through second messenger-coupled receptors, because fast cholinergic or serotonergic neurotransmission has never been observed in neocortex. However, acetylcholine and serotonin also act on ligand-gated ion channels; the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor, respectively. Here, using whole-cell patch-clamp techniques in developing ferret visual cortex, we pharmacologically isolated fast, spontaneous, and evoked cholinergic and serotonergic synaptic events in pyramidal cells and interneurons of all cortical layers. The number of cells receiving such inputs increased with the ingrowth of thalamic afferents, and the frequencies of the spontaneous events increased at eye opening. Thus, both acetylcholine and serotonin can mediate fast synaptic transmission in the visual cortex; the early onset of these mechanisms suggests a role during initial stages of circuit formation and during subsequent experience-dependent remodeling of cortical connections.
