Sung, K. W., et al. (2000). "5-HT(3) receptor function and potentiation by alcohols in frontal cortex neurons from transgenic mice overexpressing the receptor." Neuropharmacology 39(12): 2346-2351.

	The function of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(3) receptors was examined by whole-cell patch-clamp recording in dissociated frontal cortex neurons from 5-HT(3) receptor overexpressing transgenic, and wild-type mice. The effect of acute exposure to alcohols on the 5-HT(3) receptor-mediated ion current was also investigated. The 5-HT(3) receptors expressed on frontal cortex neurons in transgenic mice were activated by 5-HT and a selective 5-HT(3) receptor agonist, 2-methyl-5-HT. This current was blocked by zacopride, a specific 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist. Dissociated frontal cortex neurons from wild-type mice exhibited little or no 5-HT(3) receptor-mediated current. Ethanol (EtOH) and trichloroethanol (TCEt) potentiated the function of 5-HT(3) receptors overexpressed in transgenic mice. This is the first evidence that 5-HT(3) receptors exhibit sensitivity to alcohols when expressed by a central neuron.
