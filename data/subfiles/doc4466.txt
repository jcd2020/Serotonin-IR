Heightman, T. D., et al. (2005). "8-Piperazinyl-2,3-dihydropyrrolo 3,2-g isoquinolines: Potent, selective, orally bioavailable 5-HT1 receptor ligands." Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 15(19): 4370-4374.

	The novel 8-piperazinyl-2,3-dihydropyrroloisoquinoline template was synthesized in nine steps. The template was N-substituted to give a series of compounds showing binding to human cloned 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors with pK(i)'s greater than 9 and selectivities up to 1000-fold against other serotonin, dopamine and adrenergic receptors. Several compounds were shown to possess weak partial agonist activity in cloned receptors, which translated to antagonism in in vitro studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
