	The stress-induced hyperthermia procedure, in which effects of drugs on basal (T-1) and stress-induced body temperature (T-2) are measured, predicts anxiolytic drug effect. Serotonergic drugs alter these responses and here, we studied the role of 5-HT1A receptors in stress-induced hyperthermia by using 5-HT1A receptor knockout mice. Three strains (129/Sv, Swiss Webster and C57B16) were used because genetic background can significantly modulate the null phenotype. We found that GABA-ergic drugs with an anxiolytic profile and stimulate alpha(2) subunit containing GABA(A) receptors, including diazepam and L838,417, result in reduced Delta T (Delta T= T-2-T-1). The alpha(1) subunit containing GABAA receptor was found to be primarily involved in regulation of basal body temperature T-1 and its stimulation can induce hypothermia. In addition, stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors by buspirone results in a reduced Delta T, while stimulation of 5-HT7 receptors primarily results in hypothermia. The null mutation of 5HT(1A) receptors resulted in differences in drug-sensitivity that was further modulated by the genetic background. In particular, the null mutation on the SW and C57B16 backgrounds resulted in differential diazepam/L838,417 and 5-CT responses respectively. This indicates an interaction between the 5-HT1A receptor and genetic background and demonstrates the importance of selecting the background strain in a receptor knockout model.
