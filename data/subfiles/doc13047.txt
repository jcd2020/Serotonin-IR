Varanasi, S., et al. (1997). "5-CT or DOI augments TRH analog-induced gastric acid secretion at the dorsal vagal complex." Am J Physiol 273(5 Pt 2): R1607-1611.

	Serotonin (5-HT) interacts with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) at the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) to augment TRH-induced stimulation of gastric acid secretion. To investigate the 5-HT receptor family involved in the augmentation response, prototypical 5-HT receptor-selective agonists (146 pmol) were coinjected with the TRH analog RX-77368 (RX; 12 pmol) into the rat DVC in a 30-nl volume. The DVC coordinates were 0.2 mm anterior, 0.2 mm right, 0.6 mm ventral with respect to the calamus scriptorius. Coinjection of RX with the 5-HT agonists 5-carboxyamidotryptamine (5-CT) or (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI; 5-HT2 agonist) produced a 183 or 103% increase in gastric acid output compared with the RX injection alone. In contrast, coinjection of 2-methyl-5-HT (5-HT3 agonist) with RX produced no effect on RX-induced increase in gastric acid secretion. Moreover, coinjection of SC-53116 (5-HT4 agonist) decreased the gastric acid output by 45% compared with the RX response itself. Examination of the RX/5-HT agonist coinjection response in more rostral regions of the DVC using the same doses (5-CT/RX or DOI/RX) revealed that only 5-CT was effective in producing the augmented response to TRH analog. The results suggest that activation of 5-CT- or DOI-sensitive receptors augments, and of 5-HT4 receptors inhibits, the gastric acid response to TRH analog injected into the DVC. Thus the integrated response to several serotonin receptor subtypes may mediate changes to the TRH response induced by 5-HT at the DVC.
