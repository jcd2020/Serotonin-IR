	Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with a broad spectrum of behavioral and therapeutic effects, e.g. in depressive illness. We used the expression of c-fos, after both acute and chronic oral administration of fluvoxamine in the rat, to study its immediate and long-term effects, in relation to the distribution of Galanin (GAL) and Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP). After acute oral administration, most consistent increases were apparent in (parts of); the nucleus of the solitary tract, medial part; the lateral parabrachial nucleus, external part; the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, dorsolateral part; and the central nucleus of the amygdala, lateral part. After chronic administration, distribution of Fos-IR was similar to acute administration, although numbers of Fos-IR neurons were no longer significantly different from control values. It is concluded that activation of 5-HT3-receptors in the caudal brainstem or gastro-intestinal afferents of the vagal nerve may play a role in the observed pattern of Fos-IR after fluvoxamine administration. The relationship with the antidepressant effects of fluvoxamine needs further investigations.
