	Like hallucinogenic 5-HT2 agonists, LSD (d-lysergic acid diethylamide) produces characteristic decreases in locomotor activity and investigatory behaviors of rats tested in a novel environment. Because LSD is an agonist at bath 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors, however, the respective influences of these different receptors in the behavioral effects of LSD remain unclear. In particular, the paucity of selective 5-HT1A antagonists has made it difficult to assess the specific contribution of 5-HT1A receptors to the effects of LSD. An alternative approach to the delineation of receptor-specific effects is the use of cross-tolerance regimens. In the present studies, rats were pretreated with saline, 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.5 mg/kg SC), 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) (1.0 mg/kg SC), or LSD (60 mu g/kg SC), every 12 h for 5 or 8 days. Thirty-six hours later, rats were tested in a behavioral pattern monitor 10 min after injection of saline, 0.5 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT, 1.0 mg/kg DOI, or 60 mu g/kg LSD. As expected, tolerance to the decreases in locomotor activity produced by acute administrations of 8-OH-DPAT, DOI, or LSD occurred when rats were pretreated chronically with 8-OH-DPAT, DOI, or LSD, respectively. Furthermore, pretreatment with either 8-OH-DPAT or DOI produced cross-tolerance to LSD. These results support the hypothesis that the effects of LSD in this model reflect a combination of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 effects and support the view that there is an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors.
