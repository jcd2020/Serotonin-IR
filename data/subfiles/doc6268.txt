Leon, R. M., et al. (2019). "Hypophagia induced by hindbrain serotonin is mediated through central GLP-1 signaling and involves 5-HT2C and 5-HT3 receptor activation." Neuropsychopharmacology 44(10): 1742-1751.

	The overlap in neurobiological circuitry mediating the physiological and behavioral response to satiation and noxious/stressful stimuli are not well understood. The interaction between serotonin (5-HT) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) could play a role as upstream effectors involved in mediating associations between anorectic and noxious/stressful stimuli. We hypothesize that 5-HT acts as an endogenous modulator of the central GLP-1 system to mediate satiation and malaise in rats. Here, we investigate whether interactions between central 5-HT and GLP-1 signaling are behaviorally and physiologically relevant for the control of food intake and pica (i.e., behavioral measure of malaise). Results show that the anorexia and body weight changes induced by administration of exogenous hindbrain 5-HT are dependent on central GLP-1 receptor signaling. Furthermore, anatomical evidence shows mRNA expression of 5-HT2C and 5-HT3 receptors on GLP-1-producing preproglucagon (PPG) neurons in the medial nucleus tractus solitarius by fluorescent in situ hybridization, suggesting that PPG neurons are likely to express both of these receptors. Behaviorally, the hypophagia induced by the pharmacological activation of both of these receptors is also dependent on GLP-1 signaling. Finally, 5-HT3, but not 5-HT2C receptors, are required for the anorectic effects of the interoceptive stressor LiCl, suggesting the hypophagia induced by these 5-HT receptors may be driven by different mechanisms. Our findings highlight 5-HT as a novel endogenous modulator of the central GLP-1 system and suggest that the central interaction between 5-HT and GLP-1 is involved in the control of food intake in rats.
