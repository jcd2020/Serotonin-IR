Adham, N., et al. (1996). "H-3 5-Hydroxytryptamine labels the agonist high affinity state of the cloned rat 5-HT4 receptor." European Journal of Pharmacology 304(1-3): 231-235.

	We have used the cloned rat 5-HT4 receptor, and determined that the single protein product produced is able to bind both [H-3]5-HT and [H-3]GR113808 ([1-[(2-methyl sulphonyl) amino] ethyl-4-piperidinyl] methyl-1-methyl-1H-indole-3-carboxylate) with high affinity. The affinities of agonists for the [H-3]5-HT (agonist)-labelled receptor were significantly higher than for the [H-3]GR113808 (antagonist)-labelled receptor. Furthermore, [H-3]5-HT binding was reduced by addition of guanyl nucleotides. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the 5-HT4 receptor displays two interconvertible affinity states (high and low) for agonists, characteristic of many G protein coupled receptors, [H-3]5-HT, at the concentration employed, therefore labels the agonist high affinity state of the 5-HT4 receptor in systems in which high densities of this receptor are found.
