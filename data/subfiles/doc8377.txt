Okada, F., et al. (1989). "Pertussis toxin attenuates 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor-mediated inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal membranes." J Neurochem 52(5): 1566-1569.

	The inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonists was measured in rat hippocampal membranes isolated from animals treated with vehicle or islet-activating protein (IAP; pertussis toxin). In vehicle-treated animals, 5-HT, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, buspirone, and gepirone were potent in inhibiting forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity with EC50 values of 60, 76, 376, and 530 nM, respectively. IAP treatment reduced by 30-55% the 5-HT1A agonist inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity via 5-HT1A receptors. The data indicate that the inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein or Go (a similar GTP-binding protein of unknown function purified from brain) mediates the 5-HT1A agonist inhibition of hippocampal adenylate cyclase.
