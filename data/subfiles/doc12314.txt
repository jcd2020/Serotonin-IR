	Desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors could be involved in the long-term therapeutic effect of anxiolytic and antidepressant drugs. Pretreatment of rats with the 5-HT2A/2C agonist DOI induces an attenuation of hypothalamic 5-HT1A receptor-G(z)-protein signaling, measured as the ACTH and oxytocin responses to an injection of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT. We characterized this functional heterologous desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors in rats and examined some of the mechanisms that are involved. A time course experiment revealed that DOI produces a delayed and reversible reduction of the ACTH and oxytocin responses to an 8-OH-DPAT challenge. The maximal desensitization occurred at 2 hr, and it disappeared 24 hr after DOI injection. The desensitization was dose-dependent, and it shifted the oxytocin and ACTH dose-response curves of 8-OH-DPAT to the right (increased ED50) with no change in their maximal responses (E-max). The 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL 100,907 prevented the DOI-induced desensitization, indicating that 5-HT2A receptors mediate the effect of DOI. Analysis of the components of the 5-HT1A receptor-G(z)-protein signaling system showed that DOI did not alter the level of membrane-associated G(z)-proteins in the hypothalamus. Additionally, DOI did not alter the binding of [H-3] 8-OH-DPAT or the inhibition by GTP gammaS of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding in the hypothalamus. In conclusion, the activation of 5-HT2A receptors induces a transient functional desensitization of 5-HT1A receptor signaling in the hypothalamus, which may occur distal to the 5-HT1A receptor-G(z)-protein interface.
