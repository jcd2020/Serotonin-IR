	A wealth of evidence suggests a role for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) in the aetiology of depression and in the mode of action of antidepressant drugs. Less clear is the involvement of this neurotrophin in other stress-related pathologies such as anxiety disorders. The dorsal periaqueductal grey matter (DPAG), a midbrain area rich in BDNF and TrkB receptor mRNAs and proteins, has been considered a key structure in the pathophysiology of panic disorder. In this study we investigated the effect of intra-DPAG injection of BDNF in a proposed animal model of panic: the escape response evoked by the electrical stimulation of the same midbrain area. To this end, the intensity of electrical current that needed to be applied to DPAG to evoke escape behaviour was measured before and after microinjection of BDNF. We also assessed whether 5-HT- or GABA-related mechanisms may account for the putative behavioural/autonomic effects of the neurotrophin. BDNF (0.05, 0.1, 0.2 ng) dose-dependently inhibited escape performance, suggesting a panicolytic-like effect. Local microinjection of K252a, an antagonist of TrkB receptors, or bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist, blocked this effect. Intra-DPAG administration of WAY-100635 or ketanserin, respectively 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2c receptor antagonists, did not alter BDNF's effects on escape. Bicuculline also blocked the inhibitory effect of BDNF on mean arterial pressure increase caused by electrical stimulation of DPAG. Therefore, in the DPAG, BDNF-TrkB signalling interacts with the GABAergic system to cause a panicolytic-like effect.
