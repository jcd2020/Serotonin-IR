Alhaider, A. A., et al. (1993). "THE QUIPAZINE-INCREASED AND TFMPP-INCREASED CONDITIONED AVOIDANCE-RESPONSE IN RATS - ROLE OF 5-HT1C/5-HT2 RECEPTORS." Neuropharmacology 32(12): 1427-1432.

	The role of serotonin (5-HT) in the acquisition of the conditioned avoidance response was investigated. The effects of different serotonin agonists and antagonists, administered prior to learning sessions, were studied in groups of naive rats using the two-way shuttle box. Quipazine, an agonist at 5-HT1B/1C/2 receptors, significantly increased avoidance responding in a dose-dependent manner (1.25-10 mg/kg, s.c.). The putative 5-HT1B/1C receptor agonist TFMPP (l-[m-triftuoromethylphenyl] piperazine) at doses of 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg (s.c.), increased acquisition of conditioned avoidance but showed no significant difference from control at doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg. The 5-HT,A agonist, buspirone, significantly decreased acquisition of conditioned avoidance. Increased acquisition of conditioned avoidance induced by either quipazine or TFMPP was effectively antagonized by the mixed 5-HT1C/2. receptor antagonists, ketanserin (0.2 and 2 mg/kg, s.c.)and mianserin (1 mg/kg, s.c.). In Contrast, spiperone (5-HT1A/2 receptors antagonist: 0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) only inhibited the increased acquisition induced by TFMPP. On the other hand, the 5-HT1A/1B receptors antagonist, pindolol, failed to antagonize the increase in acquisition of conditioned avoidance caused by quipazine or TFMPP. These results suggest that quipazine increases the conditioned avoidance behaviour by an action that might be mediated through stimulation of 5-HT1C receptors. The acquisition of conditioned avoidance induced by TFMPP, which was blocked by ketanserin, mianserin and spiperone but not by pindolol, suggests the involvement of 5-HT1C/2 receptors in the action of TFMPP.
