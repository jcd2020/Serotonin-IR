Bert, B., et al. (2005). "Transient overexpression of the 5-HT1A receptor impairs water-maze but not hole-board performance." Neurobiol Learn Mem 84(1): 57-68.

	Previously, we showed that mice that overexpress the 5-HT1A receptor transiently from embryonic to perinatal stages show reduced anxiety and changes in brain serotonin turnover as adults. Here, we investigated the long-term effects of the temporary overexpression of the 5-HT1A receptor during early embryonic and perinatal development on the performance in two memory tasks. In the hole-board test mice that were homozygous for the transgene showed similar behavioral habituation but increased locomotion compared to heterozygous mice. In contrast water-maze performance of homozygous mice was impaired compared to heterozygous mice. These results suggest that a transient overexpression of 5-HT1A receptor during embryonic and perinatal development has detrimental effects on water-maze performance at adult stages.
