	We have previously shown that serotonin (5-HT) is a potent stimulator of corticosterone and aldosterone secretion by frog adrenocortical cells and we have demonstrated that the action of 5-HT is not mediated by the classical 5-HT receptor subtypes i.e. 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3. Recently, a non-classical 5-HT receptor (termed 5-HT4) has been characterized using 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxy-benzamide derivatives as serotonergic agonists. In the present report, we have investigated the possible involvement of the 5-HT4 receptor subtype in the mechanism of action of 5-HT on steroid secretion. Increasing concentrations of benzamide derivatives (zacopride, cisapride and BRL 24924) gave rise to a dose-related stimulation of corticosteroid production, zacopride being the most potent compound of this series to enhance steroidogenesis. Prolonged administration (230 min) of zacopride induced a rapid increase in corticosterone and aldosterone output followed by a gradual decline of corticosteroid secretion. During prolonged exposure of adrenal tissue to zacopride (10(-5) M), the corticotropic activity of 5-HT (10(-6) M) was totally abolished. The stimulatory effects of 5-HT and zacopride were abolished by the non-selective 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205 930. In contrast methysergide, a 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, and MDL 72222, a selective 5-HT3 antagonist did not block zacopride-induced corticosteroid secretion. Both 5-HT and zacopride induced a dose-related increase in cAMP production by frog adrenal slices. Taken together, these results indicate that the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on frog adrenocortical tissue is mediated by activation of a 5-HT4 receptor subtype positively coupled to adenylate cyclase.
