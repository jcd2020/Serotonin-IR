Dubost, E., et al. (2012). "Synthesis and Structure-Affinity Relationships of Selective High-Affinity 5-HT4 Receptor Antagonists: Application to the Design of New Potential Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Tracers." Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 55(22): 9693-9707.

	The work described herein aims at finding new potential ligands for the brain imaging of 5-HT4 receptors (5-HT(4)Rs) using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Starting from the nonsubstituted phenanthridine compound 4a, exhibiting a K-i value of 51 nM on the 5-HT4R, we explored the structure affinity in this series. We found that substitution in position 4 of the tricycle with a fluorine atom gave the best result. Introduction of an additional nitrogen atom inside the tricyclic framework led to an increase of both the affinity and selectivity for 5-HT4R, suggesting the design of the antagonist 4v, exhibiting a high affinity of 0.04 nM. Several iodinated analogues were then synthesized as potential SPECT tracers. The iodinated compound lid was able to displace the reference radioiodinated 5-HT4R antagonist (1-butylpiperidin-4-tracers yl)methyl-8-amino-7-iodo[I-123]-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxine-5-carboxylate {[I-123]1, [I-123]SB 207710} both in vitro and in vivo in brain. Compound 11d was radiolabeled with [I-125]iodine, providing a potential SPECT candidate for brain imaging of 5-HT4R.
