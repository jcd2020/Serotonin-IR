	Objectives. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of neonatal DSP-4 treatment on the central serotoninergic system in adult rats. Material and Methods. On the first and third days after birth, rats were injected with either DSP-4 (50 mg/kg, s.c.) or 0.9% NaCl (1.0 ml/kg s.c., controls). When the rats attained 10 weeks of age, both the control and DSP-4 groups were divided into two subgroups injected with either saline or the inhibitor of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) synthesis p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA). Then the rats were subjected to the Porsolt forced swim test following acute administration of the 5-HT1B ligands (agonist CP 94253, 4.0 mg/kg ip, and/or antagonist SB 216641, 4.0 mg/kg ip). Afterwards the content of monoamines and their metabolites as well as the 5-HT synthesis rate were determined in the striatum. Results. CP 94253 induced depression-like behavior in the control rats, but not in the DSP-4-treated animals. The 5-HT1B receptor antagonist SB 216641 per se did not influence the examined parameters in either group, but when injected 30 min beforehand, it significantly abolished the CP 94253-induced depression-like behavior in the control rats. Depression-like behavior in p-CPA pretreated control rats was no longer observed. The content of noradrenaline (NA) in the striatum was significantly reduced in the DSP-4-treated rats compared with the controls, but the levels of dopamine (DA), 5-HT, and their metabolites were not affected by DSP-4 treatment. Neither CP 94253 nor SB 216641 altered NA, DA, DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), HVA (homovanillic acid), 5-HT, or 5-HIAA (5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid) content in the striatum of either examined group (control and DSP-4). In contrast, the 5-HT synthesis rate was significantly attenuated in the striatum after CP 94253 application and SB 216641 was able to antagonize this effect in the tested brain area of the control rats. Conversely, CP 94253 failed to significantly inhibit the rate of 5-HT synthesis in the DSP-4-treated rats. Conclusions. These data suggest that presynaptic 5-HT1B autoreceptor sunderwent desensitization in the DSP-4-treated rats. Consequently, a neonatal chemical lesion of central noradrenergic neurons modifies central serotonergic activity in rats in adulthood (Adv Clin Exp Med 2008, 17, 6, 607-614).
