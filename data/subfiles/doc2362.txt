Das, P. and G. H. Dillon (2003). "The 5-HT3B subunit confers reduced sensitivity to picrotoxin when co-expressed with the 5-HT3A receptor." Brain Res Mol Brain Res 119(2): 207-212.

	There are currently no known agents that display selectivity between homomeric 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5-HT3A) and heteromeric 5-HT3A/3B receptors. In the present study, we show that the CNS convulsant picrotoxin selectively interacts with 5-HT3A receptors. In whole-cell patch clamp recordings, the inhibitory effect of PTX was reduced 100-fold in heteromeric mouse 5-HT3A/3B receptors, compared to homomeric 5-HT3A receptors. Picrotoxin should prove to be a useful probe for determining the presence of homomeric vs. heteromeric 5-HT3 receptors in both native tissue and recombinant receptor preparations.
