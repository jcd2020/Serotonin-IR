Fujiwara, Y., et al. (1993). "CHARACTERIZATION OF A CLONED RAT SEROTONIN 5-HT1A RECEPTOR EXPRESSED IN THE HELA-CELL LINE." Life Sciences 52(11): 949-958.

	We have previously isolated the rat serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor gene (G21Y2) and now report the expression and characterization of this receptor. The BamHI/Xbal fragment of this gene was cloned into Rc/RSV and stably transfected into HeLa cells by the calcium phosphate method. For determination of specific 5-HT1A receptor binding, [H-3]8OH-DPAT was used as the radioligand and incubated with HeLa cell membranes. The cells expressed specific and saturable binding of [H-3]8OH-DPAT with a Kd value of 0.3 nM and a Bmax value of 2 pmol/mg protein. GTP (50 muM) added to the incubation mixture increased the Kd value to 3 nM indicating that the expressed receptor is coupled to a G protein. The specific binding was inhibited by selective 5-HT1A partial agonists, such as buspirone, ipsapirone, gepirone, tandospirone, zalospirone and SUN8399 with Ki values of 1-30nM, whereas other neurotropic drugs except for spiperone (Ki=46 nM) and nemonapride (Ki=2.3 nM) were effective only at concentrations of more than 100 muM. The potencies of these compounds to inhibit [H-3]8OH-DPAT from its specific binding sites were similar to their affinities determined in rat hippocampus binding studies. These data suggest that the expressed receptor is a 5-HT1A-type similar to 5-HT1A receptors in the rat hippocampus.
