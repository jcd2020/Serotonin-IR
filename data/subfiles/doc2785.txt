Dreteler, G. H., et al. (1991). "Pressor effects following microinjection of 5-HT1A receptor agonists into the raphe obscurus of the anaesthetized rat." Br J Pharmacol 102(2): 317-322.

	1. The effects of electrical stimulation and microinjections (90 nl) of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, flesinoxan and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), and glutamate into the raphe obscurus on blood pressure, heart rate and phrenic nerve activity (central inspiratory drive) were investigated in rats anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose. 2. Electrical stimulation of the raphe obscurus caused a rise in blood pressure which was associated with bradycardia, while glutamate (2.7 nmol) caused only a rise in blood pressure. 3. Flesinoxan (1.3 nmol) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.7 nmol) increased blood pressure by 9 +/- 1 and 14 +/- 2 mmHg, respectively and did not affect heart rate. For both agonists the effect on blood pressure was shown to be dose-dependent; again no effect on the heart rate was observed over the dose-ranges chosen. 4. Microinjections of the non-selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, (+/-)-pindolol (2.7 nmol) or methiothepin (5.2 nmol), into the raphe obscurus prevented the increase in blood pressure caused by microinjection of flesinoxan. However, (+/-)-pindolol caused a sustained rise in blood pressure of 15 +/- 1 mmHg while methiothepin caused a transient rise in blood pressure. Neither drugs affected heart rate. The ability of methiothepin to attenuate the pressor effect of flesinoxan was found to be partially reversed after 30 min. 5. It is suggested that activation of 5-HT1A receptors within the raphe obscurus can cause sympatho-excitation.
