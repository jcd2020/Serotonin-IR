	HG1 is a new 5-HT-moduline antagonist which is itself an endogenous tetrapeptide specifically acting as an antagonist of 5-HT1B auto- and heteroreceptors. Blockade of endogenous 5-HT-moduline might provoke anxiolysis, so it could be a new therapeutic target in anxiety disorders. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of HG1 in three mouse models of anxiety: the four plates test (FPT), the black and white (B&W) model and the elevated plus maze (EPM). Male Swiss mice were intraperitoneally and acutely administered HG1 at the doses of 8, 16 32 and 64 mg/kg. In these three tests, HG1 exhibited an anxiolytic profile similar to that of diazepam, the referential benzodiazepine compound. without affecting locomotor activity. In the three models used, HG1 was as efficient as benzodiazepine and may consequently exert its anxiolytic effects via the GABA-ergic system. We cannot exclude that it might also act through 5-HT receptors and rather have the profile of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. (C) 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.
