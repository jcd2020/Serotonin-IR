Druse, M., et al. (2005). "Signaling pathways involved with serotonin(1A) agonist-mediated neuroprotection against ethanol-induced apoptosis of fetal rhombencephalic neurons." Developmental Brain Research 159(1): 18-28.

	Previously, this laboratory demonstrated that developing serotonin (5-HT) neurons and other fetal rhombencephalic neurons are reduced by in vivo and in vitro exposure to ethanol, effects that are related to ethanol's augmentation of apoptosis. We also found that 5-HT1A agonists diminished the ethanol-associated reduction of 5-HT neurons and other fetal rhombencephalic neurons by attenuating the proapoptotic effects of ethanol. Presently, we investigated the hypothesis that the protective/anti-apoptotic effects of a 5-HT1A agonist on fetal rhombencephalic neurons are mediated by activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI-3K) and/or the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) pathway. Apoptotic and non-apoptotic fetal rhombencephalic neurons were quantitated in primary cultures that were treated with 50 mM ethanol and with 100 nM of a 5-HT1A agonist such as 8-OH-DPAT [8-hydroxy 2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin], ipsapirone, or buspirone. Analysis of neurons stained with Hoechst 33342 demonstrated the anti-apoptotic effects of 5-HT1A agonists and implicated the involvement of the PI-3K pathway and possibly the MAPKK pathway with the protective effects of these drugs. The protective effects were blocked by a 5-HT1A antagonist (WAY 100635), an inhibitor of PI-3K (LY294002), and an inhibitor of MAPKK (PD98059). Western blot analyses showed that ethanol treatment reduces basal pAkt levels. These analyses also provide support for the involvement of the PI-3K pathway; ipsapirone stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt in control and ethanol-treated neurons, and these effects were antagonized by LY294002.
