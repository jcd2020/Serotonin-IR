van Hooft, J. A., et al. (1998). "Promiscuous coassembly of serotonin 5-HT3 and nicotinic alpha 4 receptor subunits into Ca2+-permeable ion channels." Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 95(19): 11456-11461.

	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 3 receptors (5-HT3R) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are structurally and functionally related proteins, yet distinct members of the family of ligand-gated ion channels. For most members of this family a diversity of heteromeric receptors is known at present, In contrast, known 5-HT3R subunits are all homologs of the same 5-HT3R-A subunit and form homopentameric receptors, Here we show, by heterologous expression followed by immunoprecipitation, that 5-HT3R and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 4 subunits coassemble into a novel type of heteromeric ligand-gated ion channel, which is activated by 5-HT. The Ca2+ permeability of this heteromeric ion channel is enhanced as compared with that of the homomeric 5-HT3R channel. Heteromeric 5-HT3/alpha 4 and homomeric 5-HT(3)Rs have similar pharmacological profiles, but distinct sensitivities to block by the antagonist d-tubocurarine. Coassembly of subunits beyond the boundaries of ligand-gated ion channel families may constitute an important mechanism contributing to the diverse properties and functions of native neurotransmitter receptors.
