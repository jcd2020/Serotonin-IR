	Amyloid beta(A beta) accumulation is considered the main culprit in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease(AD). Recent studies suggest that decreasing A beta production at very early stages of AD could be a promising strategy to slow down disease progression. Serotonin 5-HT4 receptor activation stimulates alpha-cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), leading to the release of the soluble and neurotrophic sAPP alpha fragment and thus precluding A beta formation. Using the 5XFAD mouse model of AD that shows accelerated A beta deposition, we investigated the effect of chronic treatments (treatment onset at different ages and different durations) with the 5-HT4 receptor agonist RS 67333 during the asymptomatic phase of the disease. Chronic administration of RS 67333 decreased concomitantly the number of amyloid plaques and the level of A beta species. Reduction of A beta levels was accompanied by a striking decrease in hippocampal astrogliosis and microgliosis. RS 67333 also transiently increased sAPP alpha concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain. Moreover, a specific 5-HT4 receptor antagonist (RS 39604) prevented the RS 67333-mediated reduction of the amyloid pathology. Finally, the novel object recognition test deficits of 5XFAD mice were reversed by chronic treatment with RS 67333. Collectively, these results strongly highlight this 5-HT4 receptor agonist as a promising disease modifying-agent for AD.
