Ferreira, H. S., et al. (2005). "Effect of the activation of central 5-HT2C receptors by the 5-HT2C agonist mCPP on blood pressure and heart rate in rats." Brain Res 1040(1-2): 64-72.

	In the present study we investigated the role of central 5-HT2C receptors in the control of blood pressure and heart rate in non-stressed and stressed, adult, male, Wistar rats. Third ventricle injections of the 5-HT2C agonist mCPP elicited a significant increase in blood pressure in non-stressed animals. The initial period of this hypertensive response (10-30 min after mCPP administration) was accompanied by baroreflex-mediated bradycardia, while after this period the coexistence of hypertension and tachycardia was observed. These cardiovascular effects promoted by the central administration of mCPP were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2C antagonist, SDZ SER 082. The administration of SDZ SER 082 alone induced no significant changes in blood pressure or heart rate. The pharmacological stimulation of central 5-HT2C receptors by mCPP did not change the hypertensive or tachycardic responses induced by restraint stress. Conversely, the blockade of central 5-HT2C receptors by SDZ SER 082 blunted stress-induced hypertension without modifying stress-induced tachycardia. It is concluded that the activation of central 5-HT2C receptors induces hypertension in non-stressed rats and that the normal function of these receptors is essential for the rise in blood pressure that occurs in the course of restraint stress.
