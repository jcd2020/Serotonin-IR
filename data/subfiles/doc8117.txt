Masalov, I. S., et al. (2012). "Effect of antagonists of serotonin receptors on modulation with serotonin of synaptic activity of projectional neurons of rat amygdala dorsolateral nucleus." Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology 48(5-6): 523-528.

	The work studies role of different receptor types of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) in the process of synaptic activity modulation with 5-HT of rat dorsolateral amygdala projection neurons. The selective antagonist of 5-HT1,2 receptors methylsergid maleate was shown to suppress the 5-HT inhibitory action on amplitude of the postsynaptic currents evoked by glutamate and GABA, whereas the antagonist of 5-HT3,4 receptors SDZ202-557 produced no effect on the above-mentioned 5-HT action. The obtained action indicates that the 5-HT modulatory effect on the projectional neuron synaptic inputs is mediated by 5-HT receptors of the 1 and 2 types.
