Alkondon, M., et al. (1998). "alpha-Bungarotoxin- and methyllycaconitine-sensitive nicotinic receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission in interneurons of rat hippocampal slices." Brain Research 810(1-2): 257-263.

	This study demonstrates for the first time that alpha 7 nicotinic receptors (nAChRs) mediate fast synaptic transmission in conventional hippocampal slices. In the presence of antagonists of muscarinic, AMPA, NMDA, GABA(A), ATP, and 5-HT3 receptors, spontaneous and evoked postsynaptic currents (PSCs) recorded from CA1 interneurons were blocked by the alpha 7 nAChR antagonists methyllycaconitine and alpha-bungarotoxin and by a desensitizing concentration of the alpha 7 nAChR agonist choline. Spontaneous nicotinic PSCs were also accompanied by Na+ transients, indicating that alpha 7 nAChR-mediated transmission serves as an excitatory signal to the CA1 interneurons in the hippocampus.
