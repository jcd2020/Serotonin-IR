	Previous physiological and pharmacological studies have shown that the serotonin(2A) (5-HT2A) receptor is involved in cerebellar functions. However, the expression of 5-HT2A receptors in the developing cerebellum has not been elucidated to date. In the present immunohistochemical study, we examined developmental changes of the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in Purkinje cells of the rat cerebellum from embryonic day 18 (E 18) to postnatal day 21 (P21). The weak immumoreaction to 5-HT2A receptors was found in the deep cerebellar nuclei on E19. In the cerebellar cortex of the hemisphere and the posterior vermis, somata of Purkinje cells became weakly immunoreactive on PO. With the dendritic elongation and arborization, the immunoreaction appeared in the proximal parts of Purkinje cell dendrites. Distal parts of the dendrites became immunoreactive after P12, and were strongly immunolabeled by P21. The present study may provide a structural basis to investigate the roles of 5-HT2A receptors during the cerebellar development. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.
