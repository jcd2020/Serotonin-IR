Liu, S. L., et al. (2003). "[Expressions of c-fos in different brain regions after microinjection of 5-HT3 receptors agonist in hippocampus]." Xi Bao Yu Fen Zi Mian Yi Xue Za Zhi 19(5): 454-455, 458.

	AIM: To explore the neuronal circuit and possible pathway related to the 5-HT3 receptors in hippocampus neuroimmunomodulation. METHODS: SABC immunocytochemical staining was used to detect the c-fos expression. RESULTS: A large number of FOS-positive neurons expression were found in the hippocampus and brain cortex at 1 hour after microinjection of 5-HT3 receptor agonist (I-PBG) in the hippocampus, but as time went on, the number of FOS positive-neurons gradually decrease. A small number of FOS positive-neurons were found only in the hypothalamus and gray matter around acqueduct of midbrain, respectively at 8 and 16 hs after injection of 1-PBG. The expression of c-fos induced by 1-PBG could be blocked by pre-microinjection of tropisetron. CONCLUSION: Brain cortex-hippocampus hypothalamus-gray matter around acqueduct of midbrain forma neuronal network, which may be related to immunomodulation.
