Wilms, K., et al. (2001). "Interactive effects of cholecystokinin-8S and various serotonin receptor agonists on the firing activity of neostriatal neuronesin rats." Neuropeptides 35(5-6): 257-270.

	In rats anaesthetized with urethane single unit activity was extracellularly recorded in the neostriatum, and several drugs were microiontophoretically ejected. Separate administration of the sulfated octapeptide cholecystokinin (CCK-8S), serotonin (5-HT) or 8-OH-DPAT (a 5-HT(1A/7) receptor agonist) predominantly induced increases in the neuronal discharge rates (Wilcoxon test significant P<0.05), whereas the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist DOI affected only a few neurones and mainly reduced firing. After coadministration of CCK-8S and serotonin, activating effects also predominated (Wt P<0.05), but the neuronal responsiveness was significantly reduced (Chi2P<0.01). Similarly, concomitant application of CCK-8S and 8-OH-DPAT led to significant activation accompanied with a reduction of inhibitory effects. The block of serotonin- or 8-OH-DPAT-effects through specific 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists implies the involvement of this receptor subtype within the striatum. In conclusion, concomitant action of CCK-8S and serotonin induces a mean level of neuronal activation that might promote normal function.
