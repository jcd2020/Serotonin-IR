Romero, L., et al. (1994). "Reduction of in vivo striatal 5-hydroxytryptamine release by 8-OH-DPAT after inactivation of Gi/G(o) proteins in dorsal raphe nucleus." Eur J Pharmacol 265(1-2): 103-106.

	5-HT1A receptor agonists reduce firing-dependent terminal 5-HT synthesis and release by activating somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors. We have examined the effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n- propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.1 mg/kg s.c.) on in vivo striatal 5-HT release in conscious rats with somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors inactivated by the application of pertussis toxin in the dorsal raphe nucleus. The uncoupling of 5-HT1A receptors from hyperpolarizing potassium channels was demonstrated by the inability of the intra-raphe application of citalopram to reduce striatal release (control animals had a 47% reduction, an effect prevented by previous treatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist (-)-tertatolol). Yet 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) decreased striatal 5-HT release by 66% (peak effect) in pertussis toxin-treated rats, a value comparable to that found in naive animals (74%). This raises the possibility that other 8-OH-DPAT-sensitive serotonergic receptors different from 5-HT1A autoreceptors may be involved in the control of terminal 5-HT release.
