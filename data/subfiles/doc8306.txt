	lThe purpose of this study was to further examine the effect of activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in the forced swim test in mice and to determine if activation of these receptors played a role in the mediation of the effects of the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT decreased immobility in the forced swim lest in mice as previously described. Both the selective 5-HT1B agonist anpirtoline (1.25-5 mg/kg) and mixed 5-HT1A/B agonist RU24969 (0.6-2.5 mg/kg) significantly increased time spent swimming in the FST.
