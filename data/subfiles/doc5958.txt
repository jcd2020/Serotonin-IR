Jakus, R., et al. (2003). "5-HT2C receptors inhibit and 5-HT1A receptors activate the generation of spike-wave discharges in a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy." Exp Neurol 184(2): 964-972.

	The present study was conducted to investigate the role of 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptors in the generation of spike-wave discharges (SWD) in the genetic absence epilepsy model Wistar Albino Glaxo rats from Rijswijk, Netherlands (WAG/Rij rats). We have determined the effects of the 5-HT2C receptor preferring agonist m-chlorophenyl-piperazine (m-CPP), the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB-242084, the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, two selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI, fluoxetine and citalopram) and their combinations in this model. The 5-HT2C agonist m-CPP caused marked, dose-dependent decreases in the cumulative duration and number of SWD administered either intraperitoneally (0.9 and 2.5 mg/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg). Treatment with SB-242084 (0.2 mg/kg, ip) alone failed to cause any significant change in SWD compared to vehicle. Pretreatment with SB-242084 (0.2 mg/kg, ip) eliminated the effects of m-CPP on SWD. Fluoxetine (5.0 mg/kg, ip) alone caused moderate increase in SWD. After pretreatment with SB-242084, the effect of fluoxetine was significantly enhanced. The combination of SB-242084 and citalopram (2.5 mg/kg, ip) caused a similar effect, namely an increase in SWD. In contrast, pretreatment with WAY-100635 significantly attenuated the effect of fluoxetine. In conclusion, these results indicate that the increase in endogenous 5-HT produces a dual effect on SWD; the inhibition of epileptiform activity is mediated by 5-HT2C, the activation by 5-HT1A receptors.
