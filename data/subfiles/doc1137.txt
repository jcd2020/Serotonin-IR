Bjorvatn, B., et al. (1992). "THE 5-HT1A ANTAGONIST (-)-ALPRENOLOL FAILS TO MODIFY SLEEP OR ZIMELDINE-INDUCED SLEEP WAKING EFFECTS IN RATS." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 42(1): 49-56.

	Sleep and waking in rats were studied for 8 h following administration of a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (zimeldine), a putative 5-HT1A antagonist {L(-)-alprenolol hydrogene tartrate monohydrate [(-)-alprenolol]} and a combination of (-)-alprenolol and zimeldine. Consistent with earlier findings, zimeldine gave a biphasic effect on sleep and waking. Waking was increased during the first 3 h, followed by a small decrease. Deep slow-wave sleep (SWS-2) showed the opposite trend. An initial decrease in SWS-2 was followed by an increase after around 3 h. Rapid eye movement sleep was markedly suppressed and latencies to sleep increased after zimeldine. (-)-Alprenolol had no effects on the different sleep and waking stages or latencies to sleep. The 5-HT1A antagonist also failed to modify the effects of zimeldine administration. The behavioral syndrome induced by a selective 5-HT1A agonist [8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)] was clearly antagonized by administration of (-)-alprenolol, indicating that (-)-alprenolol was an efficient 5-HT1A blocker. The data indicate that the sleep-waking effects of zimeldine cannot easily be explained by stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors.
