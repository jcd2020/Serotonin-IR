Bonagamba, L. G., et al. (2000). "Bradycardic responses to microinjection of N-methyl-D-aspartate into the nucleus tractus solitarius are inhibited by local activation of 5-HT(3) receptors." Neuropharmacology 39(12): 2336-2345.

	Previous reports have described that glutamate ionotropic receptors in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) are involved in the reflex control of heart rate, and that such a control can be inhibited by NTS-5-HT(3) receptor stimulation. In the present study, we examined in urethane anaesthetized rats the effects of intra-NTS microinjection of 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (CPBG), a potent and selective 5-HT(3) receptor agonist, on the cardiovascular responses to local administration of glutamate ionotropic receptor agonists. Intra-NTS microinjection of CPBG reduced the atropine-sensitive bradycardia elicited by local microinjection of NMDA without affecting the cardiovascular responses to intra-NTS microinjections of AMPA or kainic acid. The reduction by CPBG of the NMDA-evoked cardiac response was blocked by prior intra-NTS microinjection of granisetron, a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, as well as bicuculline, a GABA(A) receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the stimulation of NTS 5-HT(3) receptors specifically reduces, via a GABA-dependent mechanism, the cardiac response to local NMDA administration.
