Valdez, A., et al. (2002). "Selective heterologous regulation of 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated S-35 GTP gamma S binding in the anterior cingulate cortex as a result of 5-HT2 receptor activation." Brain Res 957(1): 174-182.

	Previous studies have shown that administration of the 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI to rats results in the heterologous desensitization of 5-HT1A receptor-mediated behavioral and neuroendocrine responses [Neuropsychopharmacology 19 (1998) 354; J. Neurosci. 21 (2001) 7919]. We hypothesized that the basis for these changes in 5-HT1A receptor function may involve changes in the capacity of the 5-HT1A receptor to activate G proteins. We examined the effect of chronic administration of DOI on the regulation of 5-HT1A receptor function at the level of receptor-G protein interaction using quantitative autoradiography of [S-35]GTPgammaS binding stimulated by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+/-)8-OH-DPAT (1 muM). Repeated administration of DOI (1 mg/kg, s.c. once daily for 8 days) resulted in a marked down-regulation in 5-HT2A binding sites, as labeled by the antagonist radioligand [H-3]ketanserin, throughout the cerebral. cortex. Chronic DOI treatment also resulted in a significant and selective attenuation of 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in the anterior cingulate cortex (vehicle-treated: 74 +/- 7.7% above basal; DOI-treated: 43 +/- 4.6% above basal). Interestingly, 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding was not altered in the dorsal or median raphe, or in the limbic structures other cortical, regions examined. The decrease in 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in anterior cingulate cortex was not to a decrease in 5-HT1A receptor number, indicating that the capacity of the 5-HT1A receptor to activate G proteins is attenuated in this cortical area following repeated DOI treatment. The heterologous regulation of 5-HT1A receptor function by chronic 5-HT2A receptor activation in the anterior cingulate cortex raises interesting questions as to how the regulatory interaction between these serotonin receptor subtypes influences cognition, memory and emotion.
