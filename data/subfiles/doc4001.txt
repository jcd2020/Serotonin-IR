Griffiths, J. L. and T. A. Lovick (2002). "Co-localization of 5-HT 2A -receptor- and GABA-immunoreactivity in neurones in the periaqueductal grey matter of the rat." Neurosci Lett 326(3): 151-154.

	The dorsal half of the midbrain periaqueductal grey matter (dPAG) functions as a midbrain aversive system. Serotonin exerts anti-aversive effects in the dPAG that are mediated by actions at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A)- and 5-HT(2A)-receptors. Since at the cellular level, 5-HT(2A)-receptor activation has been shown to evoke excitatory responses in the dPAG, it is possible that anti-aversive 5-HT(2A)-mediated effects are mediated indirectly by activation of inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurones. In rats, immunoreactivity for 5-HT(2A)-receptors was present on the soma and dendrites of neurones throughout the PAG. Co-localization studies revealed that the majority (>90%) of 5-HT(2A)-receptor-labelled cells also showed immunoreactivity for GABA. These findings may provide an anatomical substrate for 5-HT(2A)-mediated anti-aversive effects in the dPAG.
