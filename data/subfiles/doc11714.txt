	In this study, we assessed the effects of the acute administration of various 5-HT receptor antagonists on hippocampal partial seizures generated by low-frequency electrical stimulation in male Wistar rats. The seizure threshold and severity were determined by measuring the pulse number threshold and primary and secondary afterdischarges, respectively, and the latency of secondary discharge was also determined. The administration of either the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazineyl]ethyl]-N-(pyridinyl)-cyclohexanecarboximimde 3 HCl (WAY 100635, 0.1-1 mg/kg i.p.), the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist granisetron (0.3-3 mg/kg i.p.), the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist R-(+)-a-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-piperidine-methanol (MDL 100907, 0.3-3 mg/kg i.p.) or the 5-HT2B,C receptor antagonist antagonist N-(1-methyl-5-indolyl)-N'-(3-pyridyl) urea HCl (SKB 100646A, 5-50 mg/kg i.p.) did not alter the pulse number threshold compared to vehicle-treated animals. However, the acute administration of WAY 100635 (0.3 mg/kg) and M100907 (1 mg/kg) significantly increased, whereas granisetron (1 mg/kg) decreased. the primary afterdischarge duration compared to vehicle-treated animals. The latency of secondary after discharge was significantly decreased by WAY 100635 (1 mg/kg) and granisetron (3 mg/kg) compared to vehicle-treated animals. These results suggest that in this model, the antagonism of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT3 or 5-HT2B,C receptors do not lower or raise seizure threshold. However, the antagonism of 5-HT1A receptors may increase or augment seizure severity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
