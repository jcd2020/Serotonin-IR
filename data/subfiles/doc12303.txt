	Ejaculatory behavior is facilitated by activating 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A), (5-HT1A) receptors. The present study examined male sexual behavior in rat lines that were selectively bred for their different hypothermic responses to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Sexual behavior was examined in naive and experienced HDS thigh 8-OH-DPAT sensitive), LDS (low 8-OH-DPAT sensitive), and RDS (randomly bred) rats lines. In addition, the effects of 8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg) and N- {2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl) N-(2-pyridinyl)-cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY 100,635; 1 mg/kg) were examined. Naive HDS animals had diminished ejaculatory behavior las indicated by a decreased number of intromissions, mounts and ejaculations, increased ejaculation and intromission latency, and longer inter-copulatory interval), compared to the LDS and RDS groups. Ln addition, the post-ejaculatory interval (PEI) was longer in the HDS group. With experience, the HDS group improved its ejaculatory behavior. Experienced HDS animals bad a lower number of intromissions and a longer PEI compared to the LDS group. 8-OH-DPAT facilitated ejaculatory behavior in both HDS and LDS groups. This effect was more pronounced in the LDS group. WAY 100,635 did not alter sexual behavior in either group. In summary, alteration in forebrain 5-HT1A receptors in HDS animals may be involved in the ability of naive rats to achieve ejaculation. 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the regulation of resumption of sexual behavior after ejaculation.
