Kubo, T., et al. (1995). "8-OH-DPAT-induced hypotensive action and sympathoexcitatory neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of the rat." Brain Res Bull 36(4): 405-411.

	We examined whether the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) injected systemically can act directly on sympathoexcitatory neurons located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) to cause the hypotensive effect of this agent in rats. Microinjections of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone into the RVLM produced a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure. Microinjections of spiperone and pindolol, 5-HT1A antagonists, into the RVLM inhibited the depressor response to 8-OH-DPAT intravenously injected or injected into the RVLM. Microiontophoretic application of 8-OH-DPAT onto RVLM sympathoexcitatory neurons inhibited the firing of RVLM sympathoexcitatory neurons and the inhibition of unit activity by 8-OH-DPAT was blocked by microiontophoretic spiperone. Intravenous administration of 8-OH-DPAT also inhibited the firing of these neurons. Microiontophoretic application of spiperone onto the RVLM sympathoexcitatory neurons reversed the inhibitory response to intravenous 8-OH-DPAT. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that 8-OH-DPAT may exert a portion of its hypotensive effect through a direct inhibition of RVLM sympathoexcitatory neurons in rats. The receptor involved is probably the 5-HT1A type.
