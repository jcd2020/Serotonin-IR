Wong, D. T., et al. (1988). "Suppression of food intake in rats by fluoxetine: comparison of enantiomers and effects of serotonin antagonists." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 31(2): 475-479.

	R- and S-enantiomers of fluoxetine lowered food intake in meal-fed rats and in 2-deoxyglucose-induced hyperphagic rats. In both feeding paradigms, the S-enantiomer was slightly more potent. The potency of the two enantiomers of fluoxetine in producing anorectic effects paralleled their potency as inhibitors of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) uptake in vivo. Both enantiomers were selective inhibitors of 5HT uptake in vitro and showed only weak affinity for 5HT-1, 5HT-1A and 5HT-2 receptors or for other receptors in rat brain. The anorectic effect of fluoxetine in meal-fed rats was not reversed by either centrally or peripherally acting 5HT-2 receptor antagonists (ritanserin, LY53857, xylamidine, BW 501C67) or a nonspecific 5HT receptor antagonist, metergoline. However, the serotonergic mechanism involved in the anorexic effect of fluoxetine is discussed.
