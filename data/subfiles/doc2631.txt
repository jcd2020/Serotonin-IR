Czyrak, A., et al. (2003). "8-OHDPAT-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition in rats is attenuated by prolonged corticosterone treatment." Neuropsychopharmacology 28(7): 1300-1310.

	The present study investigated the impact of acute and repeated administrations of corticosterone (10 mg/kg, twice daily, for 7 days) on serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptor function, density and expression. The effect on 5-HT1A receptor function was assayed in rats by assessing the corticosterone-induced modulation of disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of acoustic startle response induced by 8-OHDPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Our experiments revealed that repeated but not acute treatment with corticosterone attenuated the 8-OHDPAT-evoked disruption of PPI without having any effect on PPI or startle amplitude alone. Chronic corticosterone treatment modulated also the neuronal activity of serotonergic pathways in the brain decreasing the level of 5-HIAA in the raphe nuclei and increasing both 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the hippocampus. Nevertheless, the effects of 8-OHDPAT on 5-HT metabolism were not changed by corticosterone. However, 5-HT1A receptor binding in the ventral hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (EC) but not in the raphe nuclei was decreased after chronic corticosterone treatment. It is concluded that chronically elevated corticosterone level is capable of inducing functional desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors which is paralleled by decreases in the 5-HT1A receptor binding in the ventral hippocampus and EC, the brain structures shown to be engaged in the regulation of PPI. Alterations in 5-HT1A receptors may be one of important mechanisms by which glucocorticoids/stress influence various psychiatric conditions.
