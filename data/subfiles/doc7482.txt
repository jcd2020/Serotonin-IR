Miller, K., et al. (1992). "MEMBRANE-BOUND AND SOLUBILIZED BRAIN 5HT(3) RECEPTORS - IMPROVED RADIOLIGAND BINDING ASSAYS USING BOVINE AREA POSTREMA OR RAT CORTEX AND THE RADIOLIGANDS H-3 GR65630, H-3 BRL43694, AND H-3 LY278584." Synapse 11(1): 58-66.

	Bovine area postrema tissue was used as a convenient source of tissue for studies of brain 5HT3 receptors. 5HT3 receptor density was determined to be 97 +/- 5 fmol/mg and 124 +/- 10 fmol/mg of protein using the commercially available 5HT3 radioligands, H-3-GR65630 and H-3-BRL43694, respectively. The equilibrium dissociation constants (K(D)) for H-3-GR65630 and H-3-BRL43694 were 0.5 +/- 0.1 nM and 1.7 +/- 0.3 nM, respectively. The affinities of a series of drugs for the 5HT3 receptor using the two radioligands were essentially identical; the K(i) values and order of affinities of agonists and antagonists were very similar to data published in studies on radiolabeling of 5HT3 receptors in rat brain H-3-LY278584 also labeled 5HT3 receptors in bovine area postrema homogenates with a K(D) of 3.1 +/- 0.1 nM and a B(max) of 84 +/- 6 fmol/mg. In rat cortical homogenates, H-3-LY278584 produced the most reliable specific signal of 72%, with a K(D) of 2.6 +/- 0.3 nM and a B(max) value of 10.5 +/- 1 fmol/mg. At 1 nM, H-3-GR65630 or H-3-BRL43694 specific binding represented 28 and 50% of total radioligand binding, respectively. These data in bovine and rat brain tissues indicate that bovine area postrema can be used with H-3-GR65630, H-3-BRL43694, or H-3-LY278584 for drug screening or molecular investigations of the brain 5HT3 receptor: only H-3-LY278584 can be used for studies on the regulation and/or the molecular properties of 5HT3 receptors in rat cortical homogenates. 5HT3 receptors were solubilized from bovine area postrema and characterized using H-3-GR65630. Gel filtration chromatography revealed a specific binding peak with a MW of approximately 600 kDa. A 10-fold enrichment of the binding activity was achieved using wheat germ agglutinin followed by application of N-acetyl-glucosamine to elute the glycosylated proteins, indicating the receptor is a glycosylated protein.
