Harris, R. N., et al. (2010). "Highly potent, non-basic 5-HT6 ligands. Site mutagenesis evidence for a second binding mode at 5-HT6 for antagonism." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 20(11): 3436-3440.

	A series of 5-HT6 ligands derived from (R)-1-(amino) methyl-6-(phenyl) sulfonyltetralin was prepared that yielded several non-basic analogs having sub-nanomolar affinity. Ligand structure-activity relationships, receptor point mutation studies, and molecular modeling of these novel ligands all combined to reveal a new alternative binding mode to 5-HT6 for antagonism.
