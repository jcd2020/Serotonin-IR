"Estrogen Treatment Blocks 8-Hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin- and Apomorphine-Induced Disruptions of Prepulse Inhibition: Involvement of Dopamine D-1 or D-2 or Serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, or 5-HT7 Receptors."

	Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a measure of sensorimotor gating and an endophenotype of schizophrenia. We have shown previously in rats that estrogen treatment prevents disruption of PPI by the 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT). The aim of the present study was to examine the role of dopamine D-1 and D-2 and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors in these effects. Part 1 of this study investigated the ability of estrogen treatment to reverse PPI disruption induced by 8-OH-DPAT or the dopamine D-1/D-2 receptor agonist apomorphine. Part 2 of this study compared these effects to the ability of various antagonists in reversing the action of 8-OH-DPAT and apomorphine on PPI. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were ovariectomized (OVX), and, where appropriate, they received silastic implants containing either a low (E20) or high dose (E100) of estrogen. Two weeks later, PPI was assessed using automated startle boxes. The disruption of PPI by either treatment with 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg) or apomorphine (0.3 mg/kg) was similarly prevented by E100 treatment. 8-OH-DPAT-induced PPI disruption was reversed by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide maleate salt (WAY 100,635; 1 mg/kg) and the typical antipsychotic and dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.25 mg/kg), but it was not reversed by pretreatment with the dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist R-(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SCH 23390; 0.1 mg/kg), the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist ketanserin (2 mg/kg), or the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 (10 mg/kg). Apomorphine-induced disruptions of PPI were reversed by haloperidol and SCH 23390 only. Estrogen may prevent disruptions of PPI induced by both 8-OH-DPAT and apomorphine by an action on dopamine D-2 receptors downstream of 5-HT1A receptors.
