	The serotonin receptor 7 (5-HT7-R) plays important functional roles in learning and memory, in regulation of mood and circadian rhythmicity. LP-211 is a new selective agonist, belonging to 1-arylpiperazine category. We report studies aimed to evaluate the modulatory effect of a subchronic regimen on behavioral/molecular parameters. At low dose [0.25 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.)], LP-211 induced a 6-h anticipated wake up in adult mice (with no temporal landmark by constant light), acting as nonphotic stimulus for 'internal clock' resetting. In standard 12:12-h light/dark cycle, a subchronic effect (5-6 days at 0.25 mg/kg, once per day) was observed: delayed wake up, reduced peak of locomotor activity and no evidence for brain cellular proliferation after ex vivo analysis. Other studies in rats were aimed to investigate long-term effects of developmental LP-211 administration into adulthood. Subchronic LP-211 (0.125 mg/kg i.p. once per day during the prepuberal phase) reduced l-glutamate, N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1 and dopamine transporter within the ventral striatum. With LP-211 (0.25 mg/kg i.p. once per day during the postpuberal phase), clear reductions were observed in the immunoreactivity of serotonin transporter and dopaminergic D2 receptors in the ventral and dorsal striatum, respectively. Subchronic LP-211 in rats and mice appears to be a suitable tool for studying the role of 5-HT7-R in sleep disorders, emotional/motivational regulations, attentive processes and executive functions.
