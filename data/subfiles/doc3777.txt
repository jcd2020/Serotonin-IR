	Serotonin (5-HT) is an important regulator of the mammalian circadian clock of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN); however, critical questions remain concerning the control of serotonergic activity in the SCN and how this relates to the putative clock-resetting actions of 5-HT. Previously, we reported that electrical stimulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) or median raphe nucleus (MRN) in hamsters evoked 5-HT release in the SCN. This DRN-stimulated 5-HT release was blocked by systemic injection of 5-HT antagonists, indicating a 5-HT receptor-mediated pathway from the DRN to the SCN. In the present study, targeted injections of the 5-HT1,2,7 antagonist metergoline or the selective 5-HT7 antagonist DR4004 into the DRN or MRN attenuated DRN-electrically stimulated SCN 5-HT release, supporting a multisynaptic DRN-->MRN-->SCN route. Intra-DRN and intra-MRN injections of the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline significantly stimulated SCN 5-HT release, whereas intra-DRN or intra-MRN injections of the GABAA agonist muscimol suppressed this release. The 5-HT release induced by intra-DRN bicuculline was also blocked by co-injection of DR4004. In complementary behavioral trials, SCN 5-HT release associated with a phase-advancing sleep deprivation stimulus at midday was prevented by intra-DRN injection of metergoline. Also, phase-advance shifts induced by novel wheel access at midday were suppressed, but not blocked, by intra-DRN injection of DR4004 or muscimol. These results indicate that 5-HT7 and GABAergic receptors of the DRN and MRN regulate behaviorally induced 5-HT release in the SCN, and that DRN output modulates nonphotic phase-resetting responses.
