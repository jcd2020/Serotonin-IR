	The involvement of abnormalities in nondopaminergic transmitter systems in Parkinson's disease is noteworthy because of the complications, such as dyskinesia, associated with long-term dopamine replacement therapy. The output regions of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars:reticulata, and the medial segment of the globus pallidus are overactive in Parkinson's disease but underactive in dyskinesia. 5-HT2C receptors are localized in these regions and are excitatory. A 5-HT2C receptor binding assay using [H-3]-mesulergine and SB 200646A to define nonspecific binding was applied to postmortem tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease and from age-matched control patients. [H-3]-mesulergine binding was increased in the substantia nigra pars reticulata by 108% in Parkinson's disease tissue as compared with control tissue. These data suggest abnormalities of 5-HT2C transmission in the basal ganglia of patients with Parkinson's disease.
