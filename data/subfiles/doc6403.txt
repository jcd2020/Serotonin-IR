	Many studies suggest that the 5-HT6 receptors are involved, along with other 5-HT receptors, in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of schizophrenia. It is a putative therapeutic target of atypical antipsychotic drugs, notably clozapine, as well as some other psychotropic agents. Preferential potentiation of dopamine (DA) efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HIP) has been suggested to contribute to the ability of atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs), e.g. clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine and ziprasidone, to improve cognitive function in schizophrenia. The present study demonstrated that SB-399885, a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, at doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg, had no effect on cortical DA release in freely moving rats. However, both doses of SB-399885 slightly but significantly increased DA release in the HIP. Of particular interest, SB-399885, 3 mg/kg, significantly potentiated the ability of a typical antipsychotic drug haloperidol, a D-2 receptor antagonist, at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, to increase DA release in the HIP but not the mPFC. The atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone, a multireceptor antagonist, which lacks 5-HT6 receptor antagonist properties, at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, produced a bell-shaped dose response effect on DA efflux in the mPFC and HIP. SB-399885 potentiated risperidone (1.0 mg/kg)-induced DA efflux in both regions. The increase in the HIP, but not the mPFC, DA efflux by 0.3 mg/kg risperidone was also potentiated by SB-399885, 3 mg/kg. These results suggest that the combined blockade of 5-HT6 and D2 receptors may contribute to the potentiation of haloperidol- and risperidone -induced DA efflux in the mPFC or HIP. The present data provides additional evidence in support of a possible therapeutic role for 5-HT6 receptor antagonism, as an addition on therapy, to enhance cognitive function in schizophrenia.
