Wierońska, J. M., et al. (2013). "The reversal of cognitive, but not negative or positive symptoms of schizophrenia, by the mGlu₂/₃ receptor agonist, LY379268, is 5-HT₁A dependent." Behav Brain Res 256: 298-304.

	mGlu(2/3) receptor agonists were shown to possess an antipsychotic-like potential in animal studies. Recent clinical investigations revealed that their antipsychotic potential might also manifest in humans. LY379268, the group II mGlu receptor orthosteric agonist, was previously shown to exhibit antipsychotic-like action in animal models of schizophrenia. However, the mechanism of its action is not fully recognized. Here, we decided to investigate the involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in the LY379268-induced antipsychotic effects. We used models of positive, negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as MK-801- and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity tests, DOI-induced head twitches, social interaction and novel object recognition. LY379268 was active in a wide range of doses (0.5-5 mg/kg), depending on the paradigm. The effects of the drug were not antagonized by 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg) in the models of positive and negative symptoms. Conversely, in the novel object recognition test, which exerts cognitive disturbances, the action of LY379268 was antagonized by WAY100635. Concomitantly, the action of a sub-effective dose of the drug was enhanced by the administration of a sub-effective dose of 5-HT(1A) agonist, (R)-(+)-8-Hydroxy-DPAT. Altogether, we propose that the antipsychotic-like action of group II mGlu receptors' agonist is 5-HT(1A) independent in context of positive and negative symptoms, while the action toward cognitive disturbances seems to be 5-HT(1A) dependent.
