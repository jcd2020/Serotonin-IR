	The 5-HT(7) receptor is a recent addition to the 5-HT receptor family and to date there is no clear idea as to its potential role in the CNS. The receptor has been mapped by in situ hybridization and 5-HT(7)-like immunoreactivity and has been detected in discrete areas of the brain including the hypothalamus (Oliver et al., 1999). This suggests the receptor may be involved in temperature regulation and have shown that a selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist reverses the hypothermic effect of 5-CT in guinea-pigs. The current study confirmed that the 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists, SB-269970 (1-30 mg/kg, i.p.) and SB-258719 (5-20 mg/kg, i.p.), but not the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY 100635(0.1-1 mg/kg, s.c.), or the 5-HT(1B/D) antagonist, GR127935 (1.25-5 mg/kg, i.p.), reversed the hypothermic effect of 5-CT in mice. In addition the effect of 5-CT on body temperature was examined on 5-HT(7) receptor null mutant mice. 5-CT (0.1-1 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced rectal temperature in wildtype but not 5-HT(7) receptor knockout mice. This suggests that the hypothermic effects of 5-CT are mediated through the 5-HT(7) receptor. All procedures were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act (1986).
