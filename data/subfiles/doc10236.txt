	In vivo microdialysis was used to investigate the role of serotonin in the locomotor hyperactivity produced by injections of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT), muscimol and baclofen into the median raphe nucleus (MR) of unanesthetized rats. Intra-MR injections of the GABA(A) agonist muscimol (25 ng) resulted in a pronounced increase in locomotor activity which was accompanied by a 42% decrease in hippocampal serotonin release during the first hour following injection. Intra-MR injections of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen (125 ng) induced hyperactivity of a similar magnitude, but failed to affect hippocampal serotonin release. In contrast, the serotonin (5-HT1A) agonist 8-OHDPAT (5 mu g) produced only a small effect on locomotor activity but reduced hippocampal serotonin output by 51%. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to dissociate the effects of intra-MR drug injections on locomotor activity and hippocampal 5-HT release and strongly support the view that nonserotonergic neurons in the paramedian tegmentum are importantly involved in the control of behavioral arousal.
