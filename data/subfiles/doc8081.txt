Newberry, N. R. and T. Priestley (1988). "A 5-HT1-like receptor mediates a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibition of rat ventromedial hypothalamic neurones in vitro." Br J Pharmacol 95(1): 6-8.

	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-carboxamidotryptamine and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin inhibited rat ventromedial hypothalamic neurones in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. The agonist-induced inhibition was reduced by spiperone (1 microM) and by pertussis toxin , but not by MDL 72222 (10 microM) or ketanserin (1 microM). The inhibition appeared to be mediated via 5-HT1A-receptors and a pertussis toxin-sensitive pathway.
