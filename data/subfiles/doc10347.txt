	The activity of a selective tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist, PD 154075 ([(2-benzofuran)-CH2OCO]-(R)-alpha-MeTrp-(S)-NHCH(CH3)Ph), was examined in radioligand binding studies, in a [Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)]substance P-induced foot-tapping model in the gerbil, and in cisplatin-induced acute and delayed emesis in the ferret. In radioligand binding studies, PD 154075 showed nanomolar affinity for the human, guinea-pig, gerbil, dog and ferret NK1 receptors with an approximate 300 times lower affinity for the rodent NK1 receptor. Using NK2, NK3 receptors and a range of other receptor ligands, PD 154075 was shown to exhibit a high degree of selectivity and specificity for the human type NK1 receptor. Following subcutaneous administration PD 154075 dose dependently (1-100 mg/kg) antagonised the centrally mediated [Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)] substance P-induced foot tapping in the gerbil with a minimum effective dose (MED) of 10 mg/kg. The ability of PD 154075 to readily penetrate into the brain following oral administration was confirmed by its extraction and high performance liquid chromatography assay from the rat brain. PD 154075 was shown to achieve a relatively fast and sustained brain concentration (brain/plasma ratios ranged from 0.27 to 0.41 during the time period of 0.25-12 h). Further pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the absolute oral bioavailability of PD 154075 in the rat was (mean +/- S.D.) 49 +/- 15%. PD 154075 (1-30 mg/kg, i.p.) dose dependently antagonised the acute vomiting and retching in the ferret measured for 4 h following administration of cisplatin (10 mg/kg, i.p.) with a MED of 3 mg/kg. The administration of a lower dose of cisplatin (5 mg/kg, i.p,) in the ferret induces both an acute (day 1) and delayed (days 2 and 3) phase of emesis. The i.p. administration of PD 154075, 10 mg/kg three times a day for 3 days, almost completely blocked both the acute and delayed emetic responses. In the same study, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (1 mg/kg, i.p., t.i.d.) was also very effective against the acute emetic response observed during the first 4 h following cisplatin, but it was only weakly active against the delayed response. In conclusion, PD 154075 is a selective and specific high affinity NK, receptor antagonist with good oral bioavailability which is effective against both acute and delayed emesis induced by cisplatin in the ferret.
