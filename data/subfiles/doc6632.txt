	Anseculin (KA-672) is a multifunctional antidementia agent under development that may be of therapeutic value in the treatment of progressive neuronal and cognitive decline, which are common in Alzheimer disease. In vitro and ex vivo experiments have characterized anseculin as a potent functional antagonist of central alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. In comparison to prazosin, the in vitro potency of anseculin for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors is about 8 times less. Like prazosin, anseculin shows an inhibition of phenylephrine- (norepinephrine-) induced accumulation of inositol phosphates. Oral treatment with 1 mg/kg anseculin or 1 mg/ kg prazosin show similar effects on alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor binding ex vivo, indicating a greater ex vivo potency of anseculin on central alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. Anseculin has only weak affinity for central muscarinic cholinergic receptors. Anseculin inhibited adenylate cyclase and reduced intracelluar cAMP levels of about 30%, similar to the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. Together with its high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors (IC50 for H-3-8-OH-DPAT binding is about 8 nM), these data suggest that anseculin also exhibits 5-HT1A agonistic properties.
