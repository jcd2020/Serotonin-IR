	This study is to explore the possible mechanisms of the antidepressant-like effect of agmatine. By using two traditional "behavior despair" model, tail suspension test and forced swimming test, we examined the effects of some monoamine receptor antagonists (including beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist/5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist pindolol, alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonists yohimbine and idazoxan and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron) on the antidepressant-like action of agmatine in mice. Activity of adenylate cyclase (AC) in the synapse membrane from rat frontal cortex was determined by radioimmunoassay. Single dose of agmatine (5-40 mg x kg(-1), ig) dose-dependently decrease the immobility time in tail suspension test in mice, indicating an antidepressant-like effect. The effect of agmatine (40 mg x kg(-1), ig) was antagonized by co-administration of beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist/5-HT1A/1B receptor antagonist pindolol (20 mg x kg(-1), ip), alpha2-adrenergic receptor antagonists yohimbine (5-10 mg x kg(-1), ip) or idazoxan (4 mg x kg(-1), ip), but not beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol (5-20 mg x kg(-1), ip) and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron (5-40 mg x kg(-1), ip). Agmatine (5-40 mg x kg(-1), ig) also dose-dependently decrease the immobility time in forced swimming test in mice. The effect of agmatine (40 mg x kg(-1), ig) was also antagonized by pindolol (20 mg x kg(-1), ip), yohimbine (5-10 mg x kg(-1), ip), or idazoxan (4 mg x kg(-1), ip). Incubation of agmatine (0.1-6.4 micromol x L(-1)) with the synaptic membrane extracted from rat frontal cortex activated the AC in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. While the effect of agmatine (6.4 micromol x L(-1)) was dose-dependently antagonized by pindolol (1 micromol x L(-1)) or yohimbine (0.25-1 micromol x L(-1)). Chronic treatment with agmatine (10 mg x kg(-1), ig, bid, 2 w) or fluoxetine (10 mg x kg(-1), ig, bid, 2 w) increased the basic activity, as well as the Gpp (NH)p (1-100 micromol x L(-1)) stimulated AC activity in rat prefrontal cortex. These results indicate that regulation on 5-HT1A/1B and alpha2 receptors, and activation AC in the frontal cortex is one of the important mechanisms involving in agmatine's antidepressant-like action.
