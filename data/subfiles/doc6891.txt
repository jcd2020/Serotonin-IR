	Serotonin (5-HT) 1A receptors exist in high and low affinity states. Agonist ligands bind preferentially to the high affinity state receptors, providing a more functionally relevant measure than antagonist binding. We now report comparison of 5-HT(1A) binding in vivo using both [(1)(1)C]CUMI-101 (agonist) and [(1)(1)C]WAY100635 (antagonist) in nonhuman primates. PET studies show that both tracers bind to known 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)R)-rich regions of baboon brain. The binding (BP(F)) of [(1)(1)C]CUMI-101 was lower on an average of 55% across the regions of interest (ROIs) compared to [(1)(1)C]WAY100635. This ratio is consistent with the in vitro binding data of agonist and antagonist 5-HT(1A)R ligands previously reported.
