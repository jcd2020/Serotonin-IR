	Using an animal model of drug relapse, we found that intermittent footshock stress reinstates alcohol seeking, an effect attenuated by the 5-HT reuptake blocker fluoxetine and by corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor antagonists. Here we studied the role of the 5-HT cell body region of the median raphe nucleus (MRN) and CRF receptors in this site in reinstatement of alcohol seeking. Rats were given alcohol in a two-bottle choice procedure (water vs alcohol) for 25 d and were then trained for 1 hr/d to press a lever for alcohol (12% w/v) for 23-30 d. Subsequently, lever pressing for alcohol was extinguished by terminating drug delivery for 5-9 d. Tests for reinstatement of alcohol seeking were then performed under extinction conditions. Intra-MRN infusions of 8-OH-DPAT [8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin] (a 5-HT1A agonist that decreases 5-HT cell firing and release) reinstated alcohol seeking. Reinstatement of alcohol seeking also was observed after intra-MRN infusions of low doses of CRF (3-10 ng), which mimicked the effect of ventricular infusions of higher doses of the peptide (300-1000 ng). Finally, intra-MRN infusions of the CRF receptor antagonist d-Phe CRF (50 ng) blocked the effect of intermittent footshock (10 min) on reinstatement. These data suggest that an interaction between CRF and 5-HT neurons within the MRN is involved in footshock stress-induced reinstatement of alcohol seeking.
