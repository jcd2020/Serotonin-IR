Davidson, C. and J. A. Stamford (1996). "Serotonin efflux in the rat ventral lateral geniculate nucleus assessed by fast cyclic voltammetry is modulated by 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D autoreceptors." Neuropharmacology 35(11): 1627-1634.

	Fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV) was used to measure electrically stimulated monoamine efflux in the rat ventral lateral geniculate nucleus (vLGN). The electrochemical characteristics of the released species resembled 5-HT but not dopamine or noradrenaline. Amine efflux was abolished by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin (0.1 microM), Ro 4-1284 (1.0 microM), the fast-acting reserpine analogue, and removal of Ca2+ from the superfusate. Amine efflux was unaffected by the monoamine oxidase inhibitor clorgyline (0.1 microM). Of paroxetine (0.1 microM), desipramine (50 nM) and vanoxerine (0.5 microM), selective blockers of 5-HT, noradrenaline and dopamine uptake respectively, only paroxetine increased monoamine efflux (to 194 +/- 25%, mean +/- SEM) and prolonged the removal half-life (to 638 +/- 105%). The non-specific 5-HT1 antagonist methiothepin (0.2 microM) increased 5-HT efflux on long (20 pulses at 20 Hz) but not short trains (20 pulses at 100 Hz). When tested on pseudo-one-pulse stimulations (5 pulses, 100 Hz), the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-OHDPAT (1.0 microM) had no effect. CP 93129 (0.3 microM), the selective 5-HT1B agonist, decreased 5-HT efflux to 37 +/- 4% of control and was antagonised by the 5-HT1B blocker isamoltane (0.5 microM) and by the 5-HT1D/B antagonist GR 127935 (50 nM). The preferential 5-HT1D agonist sumatriptan (0.5 microM) also decreased 5-HT efflux, to 55 +/- 6% and was antagonised by GR 127935 (50 nM) but not isamoltane (0.5 microM). These results suggest that 5-HT released in the vLGN can be measured by FCV. Furthermore, released 5-HT is taken up by the 5-HT transporter and may be under the influence of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D autoreceptors.
