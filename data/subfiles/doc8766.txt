	5-HT receptors are predominantly located in the brain and are involved in pancreatic function and cell proliferation through sympathetic nervous system. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of hypothalamic 5-HT, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor binding and gene expression in rat model of pancreatic regeneration using 60% pancreatectomy. The pancreatic regeneration was evaluated by 5-HT content, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus of sham operated, 72 h and 7 days pancreatectomised rats. 5-HT content was quantified by HPLC. 5-HT1A receptor assay was done by using specific agonist [3H]8-OH DPAT. 5-HT2C receptor assay was done by using specific antagonist [3H]mesulergine. The expression of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor gene was analyzed by RT-PCR. 5-HT content was higher in the hypothalamus of 72 h pancreatectomised rats. 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors were down-regulated in the hypothalamus. RT-PCR analysis revealed decreased 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor mRNA expression. The 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors gene expression in the 7 days pancreatectomised rats reversed to near sham level. This study is the first to identify 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptor gene expression in the hypothalamus during pancreatic regeneration in rats. Our results suggest the hypothalamic serotonergic receptor functional regulation during pancreatic regeneration.
