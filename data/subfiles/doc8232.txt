Maura, G., et al. (2000). "Serotonin inhibition of the NMDA receptor/nitric oxide/cyclic GMP pathway in human neocortex slices: involvement of 5-HT(2C) and 5-HT(1A) receptors." Br J Pharmacol 130(8): 1853-1858.

	The NMDA receptor/nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic GMP pathway and its modulation by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was studied in slices of neocortical samples obtained from patients undergoing neurosurgery. The cyclic GMP elevation produced by 100 microM NMDA was blocked by 100 microM of the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) or by 10 microM of the soluble guanylate cyclase inhibitor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-alpha] quinoxaline-1-one (ODQ). The NMDA effect was prevented by 5-HT or by the 5-HT(2) agonist (+/-)-1-(2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane ((+/-)-DOI; EC(50)=22 nM). The (+/-)-DOI inhibition was insensitive to the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist MDL 100907 or the 5-HT(2B) antagonist rauwolscine; it was largely prevented by 1 microM of the non-selective 5-HT(2C) antagonists mesulergine (5-HT(2A,B,C)), ketanserin (5-HT(2A,C)) or SB 200646A (5-HT(2B,C)); it was completely abolished by 0.1 microM of the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist SB 242084. The NMDA-induced cyclic GMP elevation also was potently inhibited by the selective 5-HT(2C) agonist RO 60-0175 and by the antidepressant trazodone, both added at 1 microM, in an SB 242084-sensitive manner. Finally, the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 1 microM) inhibited the NMDA-evoked cyclic GMP response, an effect blocked by the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635. In conclusion, the NMDA receptor/NO/cyclic GMP pathway in human neocortex slices can be potently inhibited by activation of 5-HT(2C) or 5-HT(1A) receptors.
