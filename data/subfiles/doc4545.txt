	Spiroxatrine has been reported to be a 5-HT1A serotonin receptor antagonist. Therefore [3H]spiroxatrine was synthesized and its 5-HT1A receptor binding properties in homogenates of rat hippocampal membranes were characterized with the expectation that it would be the first 5-HT1A antagonist radioligand. [3H]8-Hydroxydipropylaminotetralin [( 3H]8-OH-DPAT), a well-characterized 5-HT1A agonist radioligand, was studied in parallel for comparative purposes. Scatchard analyses of saturation studies of [3H]spiroxatrine and [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding produced KD values of 0.9 nM and 1.8 nM, with Bmax values of 424 and 360 fmol/mg protein, respectively. A highly significant correlation (r = 0.98; p less than 0.001) exists between Ki values obtained for a series of drugs in competing for [3H]-spiroxatrine and [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding. Of special interest was the observation that 5-HT1A agonists such as serotonin, 8-OH-DPAT, and ipsapirone competed with equal high affinities for [3H]spiroxatrine or [3H]8-OH-DPAT-labelled 5-HT1A receptors. [3H]Spiroxatrine and [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding to 5-HT1A receptors was inhibited by guanosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP) in a concentration-dependent manner whereas adenosine 5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate (a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP) had no effect. The similarities in the 5-HT1A receptor radiolabelling properties of [3H]spiroxatrine and [3H]8-OH-DPAT, i.e., the high affinities of agonists and the guanyl nucleotide sensitivity, indicate that [3H]spiroxatrine has "agonist-like" binding properties in its interaction with the 5-HT1A receptor.
