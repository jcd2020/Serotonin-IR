Tanco, S. A., et al. (1993). "LACK OF EFFECTS OF 5-HT3 ANTAGONISTS ON NORMAL AND MORPHINE-ATTENUATED SEXUAL BEHAVIORS IN FEMALE AND MALE-RATS." Experientia 49(3): 238-241.

	Although 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor activity is known to influence copulation, the effects of 5-HT3 receptor-selective drugs on sexual activity have yet to be systematically studied. The following experiments investigated the effects of the 5-HT3-selective antagonists MDL 72222, ondansetron and ICS 205-930 on female sexual behaviour; male rats were studied using ondansetron and granisetron. These compounds influenced neither male nor female copulatory behaviours, suggesting that 5-HT3 receptors contribute little to the modulation of sexual activity. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists block certain opioid-induced behaviours and opioids selectively inhibit sexual behaviours; therefore, the ability of ondansetron and ICS 205-930 to modify morphine-attenuated copulatory activity was also tested. While morphine inhibited copulation, 5-HT3 antagonists failed to reverse the effects.
