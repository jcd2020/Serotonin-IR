Shibano, T., et al. (1992). "Pharmacological profile of a new 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptor antagonist, DV-7028." Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther 319: 114-128.

	The pharmacological profile of DV-7028, a pyrido triazine derivative, showed that it is a potent and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2 receptor antagonist. DV-7028 bound to 5-HT2 receptors in rat brain membranes with a Ki value of 22 nM and caused shifts to the right of the concentration-contraction curves to 5-HT in rat thoracic aorta and canine femoral arteries, which are attributed to activation of 5-HT2 receptors. The compound was highly active by oral administration (0.1-10 mg/kg) based on blockade of the 5-HT-induced pressor responses in pithed rats. In contrast, DV-7028 had no affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. The affinity of the compound was 14-26 times greater for the 5-HT2 receptors when compared to 5-HT1C, adrenergic alpha 1, dopamine D2 and histamine H1 receptors. In human platelets, DV-7028 attenuated the aggregation induced by collagen and inhibited the amplifying effect of 5-HT with collagen on platelet aggregation. Furthermore, a 10-day toxicity study revealed that DV-7028 was a safe compound which did not produce lethality at repeated oral doses of 800 mg/kg/day in rats. These results indicate that DV-7028 is a selective and potent 5-HT2 receptor antagonist which is orally active and safe.
