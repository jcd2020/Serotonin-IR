Segal, M. (1990). "Serotonin attenuates a slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential in rat hippocampal neurons." Neuroscience 36(3): 631-641.

	Activity of hippocampal neurons was recorded in an in vitro slice preparation. Topical application of serotonin produced hyperpolarization, blockade of a slow afterhyperpolarization which follows a burst discharge and blockade of a slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The slow inhibitory postsynaptic potential evoked by stimulation of the apical dendritic region of the hippocampus is more sensitive to serotonin than the membrane potential or conductance. The effects of serotonin on the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are blocked by the 5-HT1a antagonist spiperone, and not by mianserin, a 5-HT2 antagonist. The attenuation of the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials is not accompanied by a change in postsynaptic reactivity to GABA or baclofen. Serotonin blocks repetitive large inhibitory postsynaptic potentials evoked in hippocampal neurons by topical application of 4-aminopyridine. Putative interneurons are more sensitive to topical application of serotonin than pyramidal neurons. Fenfluramine, a serotonin releaser mimics the effects of topical application of serotonin indicating that synaptically released serotonin can produce the changes in membrane potential and reactivity to afferent stimulation. It is suggested that serotonin attenuates slow inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by inhibiting feed forward inhibitory interneurons which impinge upon the recorded pyramidal neurons.
