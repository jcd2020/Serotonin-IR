Jang, J. W., et al. (2012). "5-HTâ‚‚c receptor selectivity and structure-activity relationship of N-methyl-N-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)benzenesulfonamide analogs." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 22(1): 347-352.

	Agonists of the 5-HT(2C) receptor have attracted much attention as therapeutic agents for the treatment of obesity. Subtype selectivity against other 5-HT(2) receptors is one of the most important prerequisites for reducing side effects. We present the synthesis of N-methyl-N-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)benzenesulfonamide analogs and their structure-activity relationship studies on 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors. Although the compounds showed nanomolar activity to the 5-HT(2C) receptor, their selectivity against the 5-HT(2A) receptor was modest to low. Molecular modeling studies using homology modeling and docking simulation revealed that selectivity originated from subtype specific residues. The observed binding modes and receptor-ligand interactions provided us a clue for optimizing the selectivity against the 5-HT(2A) receptor.
