	AimsSerotonergic (5-HT) modulation of the lateral habenula (LHb) activity is central in normal and pathologic conditions such as mood disorders. Among the multiple 5-HT receptors (5-HTRs) involved, the 5-HT2CR seems to play a pivotal role. Yet, the role of 5-HT(2A)Rs in the control of the LHb neuronal activity is completely unknown. MethodsSingle-cell extracellular recording of the LHb neurons was used in rats to study the effect of the general activation and blockade of the 5-HT2CR and 5-HT2AR with Ro 60-0175 and SB242084, TCB-2 and MDL11939, respectively. The expression of both receptors in the LHb was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. ResultsCumulative doses (5-640g/kg, iv) of Ro 60-0175 and TCB-2 affected the activity of 34% and 63% of the LHb recorded neurons, respectively. LHb neurons were either inhibited at low doses or excited at higher doses of the 5-HT2A/CR agonists. SB242084 or MDL11939 (both at 200g/kg, iv) did not modify neuronal firing when injected alone, but reverted the bidirectional effects of Ro 60-0175 or TCB-2, respectively. 5-HT(2C)Rs and 5-HT(2A)Rs are expressed in less than the 20% of the LHb neurons, and they neither colocalize nor make heterodimers. Strikingly, only 5-HT(2A)Rs are expressed by the majority of LHb astrocyte cells. ConclusionsPeripheral administration of 5-HT2AR agonist promotes a heterogeneous pattern of neuronal responses in the LHb, and these effects are more prominent than those induced by the 5-HT2CR activation.
