Bel, N. and F. Artigas (1999). "Modulation of the extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine brain concentrations by the serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, milnacipran. Microdialysis studies in rats." Neuropsychopharmacology 21(6): 745-754.

	We examined the effects of the administration of milnacipran, a dual inhibitor of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and noradrenaline uptake on the 5-HT output in rat brain. Local milnacipran administration increased the 5-HT output in frontal cortex and the midbrain raphe nuclei 7- and 10-fold by a Ca(2+)- and tetrodotoxin-dependent mechanism. However, the subcutaneous administration of milnacipran (1-60 mg/kg s.c.) elevated the 5-HT output much less in these areas (200-230% of baseline at 60 mg/kg). In hypothalamus, 10 mg/kg s.c. raised 5-HT levels to 170%. The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 caused a small potentiation of the effects of milnacipran. The baseline 5-HT output was unaffected by 2-week treatments with milnacipran (30 and 60 mg/kg.day). The distinct regional profile and the lack of enhancement of its effects by WAY-100635 and prolonged treatment suggest that milnacipran does not exert its antidepressant action through an enhancement of the serotonergic function.
