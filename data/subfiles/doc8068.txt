	RG 12915, N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2.]octan-3(S)-yl)-2-chloro-(5aS,9aS)-5a,6,7,8,9,9a-hexahydrodibenzofuran-4-carboxamide, a potent antiemetic agent active in reducing emesis produced by antineoplastic agents, was examined in tests of 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor blockade. RG 12915 was found to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT3 receptor activation both in blocking 5-HT-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum and in blocking the Bezold-Jarisch effect in the rat. Compared to several other 5-HT, antagonists, RG 12915 had a greater pA2 value (11.2) for blocking 5-HT-induced contractions of guinea pig ileum than zacopride (8.3); BRL 43694 (granisetron) (9.1); and GR 38032F (ondansetron) (7.4). Falls in heart rate due to 5-HT3 receptor activation following intravenous (i.v.) administration of 5-HT (the Bezold-Jarisch effect) were also potently reduced by RG 12915. Minimum effective dose (MED) levels (in parentheses), defined as the lowest dose at which each compound produced a significant reduction in the Bezold-Jarisch effect, were determined for RG 12915 (1.0 mug/kg, i.v.); zacopride (3.0); granisetron (9.0); and ondansetron (27.0). The order of potency in blocking 5-HT3 receptor activation was generally the same as the order of potency in 5-HT3 receptor binding. RG 12915 had a lower K(i) value (0.17 +/- 0.02 nM, mean +/- SEM) in binding studies using H-3-GR-65630 as the ligand in rat entorhinal cortex tissue than either zacopride (1.5 +/- 0.4); granisetron (1.7 +/- 0.3); or ondansetron (6.2 +/- 2.1). RG 12915 was also found active in blocking contractions of guinea pig ileum and the Bezold-Jarisch effect induced by the somewhat selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist 2-methyl-serotonin. The results support the idea that this orally active antiemetic agent is a potent antagonist of 5-HT3 receptor activation.
