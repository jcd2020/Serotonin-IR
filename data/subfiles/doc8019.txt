Markina, N. V., et al. (2006). "[Neonatal buspirone modulates the intermale aggression in adult mice]." Zh Vyssh Nerv Deiat Im I P Pavlova 56(4): 491-498.

	Mice of two strains with different levels of male aggression (RSB and RLB) were subjected to daily injections of 5-HT1A receptor agonist buspirone (25 microg) on the 2nd - 6th postnatal days. This neonatal treatment augmented the aggressive behavior (tested in the dyadic contests with non-aggressive A/Sn males) in aggressive RSB mice and reduced aggression in less aggressive RLB. Correlations with different signs were found between the 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels in the neocortex, hippocampus, and hypothalamus and behavioral indices of aggression in RSB and RLB males. The remote effects of neonatal buspirone in these two mice strains presumably depend on genotype-related features of ontogeny of the 5-HT system.
