	The tractability of light-activated receptors makes them attractive tools by which to study the brain. They allow for the noninvasive and specific control of neuronal signaling and could allow for the study of receptor pathways that occur faster than the rate of diffusion. Furthermore, with the aid of implantable light devices, light-activated receptors have the potential for use in live animals and later in humans to control and cure G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathways involved in diseases. We will summarize here the latest developments for controlling intracellular signaling pathways by light-activated GPCRs and enzymes.
