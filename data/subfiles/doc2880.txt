Earley, W. R., et al. (2020). "A pooled post hoc analysis evaluating the safety and tolerability of cariprazine in bipolar depression." J Affect Disord 263: 386-395.

	BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of cariprazine, a dopamine D(3)-preferring D(3)/D(2) receptor partial agonist and serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonist, was evaluated in 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with bipolar depression. METHODS: Safety and tolerability were evaluated in 2 post hoc analyses. Modal dose analysis: pooled data from all 4 flexible/fixed-dose trials (dose groups: <1.5, 1.5, 3 mg/d). Fixed-dose analysis: pooled data from 2 identically designed fixed-dose trials (1.5 and 3 mg/d dose groups). RESULTS: The modal dose and fixed-dose analyses evaluated data from 1775 and 970 patients, respectively. Cariprazine was generally safe and well tolerated; study completion rates were 78% and 82% in the modal dose and fixed-dose analyses, respectively. In modal dose analysis, treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) occurred in 60% of overall cariprazine- and 55% of placebo-treated patients; nausea (8% vs 3%) and akathisia (7% vs 2%) occurred in ≥5% of cariprazine patients and twice the rate of placebo. Metabolic changes were small and generally similar for cariprazine and placebo; mean increase in glucose was 3.1 mg/dL for cariprazine and 2.6 mg/dL for placebo. Fixed-dose and modal dose findings were generally consistent; values for most metabolic parameters were slightly higher for fixed-dose 3 mg/d versus 1.5 mg/d. LIMITATIONS: Post hoc analyses, modal dose groups, short treatment duration. CONCLUSIONS: In modal dose (0.25-3 mg/d) and fixed-dose (1.5 and 3 mg/d) analyses, cariprazine was generally safe and well tolerated in the treatment of bipolar depression. Slightly improved tolerability was observed with fixed-dose cariprazine 1.5 mg/d versus 3 mg/d. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov NCT00852202, NCT01396447, NCT02670538, NCT02670551.
