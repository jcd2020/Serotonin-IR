Lyubashina, O. A., et al. (2016). "[EFFECTS OF 5-HT3-RECEPTOR BLOCKADE ON VISCERAL NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS IN THE VENTROLATERAL RETICULAR FIELD OF THE RAT MEDULLA OBLONGATA]." Zh Evol Biokhim Fiziol 52(4): 281-291.

	The caudal ventrolateral medullary reticular formation is the first supraspinal level processing visce- ral nociceptive signals. In experiments on rats reactions of neurons of this zone to nociceptive stimulation of large intestine were examined and effects of selective blockade of 5-HT3-receptors on these reactions were assessed. According to the character or responses to nociceptive colorectal stimulation (CRS) the re- corded medullary cells were divided into three groups - excitated, inhibited and indifferent. Intravenous injection of 5-HT3-antagonist granisetron (1 and 2 mg/kg) as well as local application of the substance on medulla surface (1.25 and 2.5 nmole) suppressed dose-dependently background and evoked discharges of the reticular neurons excited by CRS but did not exert so much expressed influence on the cells inhibited by visceral nociceptive stimulation. Spike activity of the group of neurons indifferent to CRS under simi- lar conditions was of 5-HT3-independent character. The results obtained provide evidence that 5-HT3-re- ceptors mediate the facilitating effect of serotonin on the supraspinal transmission of abdominal nocicep- tive stimulus which, partly at least, is realized through selective activation of visceral nociceptive neurons of the medulla. The blocking of this mechanism may underlie the analgesic effect of 5-HT3-antagonists in a abdominal pain syndromes.
