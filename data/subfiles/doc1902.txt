Chidlow, G. and N. N. Osborne (1997). "Antagonism of muscarinic receptors in the rabbit iris-ciliary body by 8-OH-DPAT and other 5-HT1A receptor agonists." Journal of Neural Transmission 104(10): 1015-1025.

	Physiological studies have shown that serotonin and 5-HT1A agonists can influence muscarinic function in the rabbit iris-ciliary body (ICE). The purpose of this study was to examine whether a direct interaction exists between muscarinic and 5-HT1A receptors in the ICE. At high concentrations, the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT attenuated the carbachol-induced stimulation of inositol phosphates (InsPs) production, but this was not blocked by the presence of 5-HT1A antagonists. In contrast, serotonin failed to influence carbachol-induced InsPs formation. Moreover, 8-OH-DPAT but not serotonin displayed affinity for [H-3]QNB binding sites in the ICE. The combined data suggest that activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the ICE does not cause a modulation of muscarinic receptor-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover. The data instead suggest that, at high concentrations, 8-OH-DPAT acts as an antagonist at muscarinic receptors and in this way influences muscarinic receptor function. The mechanism of 5-HT-induced modulation of muscarinic function in the ICE therefore remains to be elucidated.
