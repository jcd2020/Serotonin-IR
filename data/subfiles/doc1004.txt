Blackburn, T. P., et al. (2002). "Effect of acute and chronic administration of the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB-243213 on midbrain dopamine neurons in the rat: an in vivo extracellular single cell study." Synapse 46(3): 129-139.

	In this study, we examined the effect of the acute and chronic administration of the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB-243213 (SB) on the activity of spontaneously active dopamine (DA) cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) in anesthetized, albino, male Sprague-Dawley rats. This was accomplished using the technique of in vivo extracellular single cell recording. The acute i.v. administration of SB-243213 (0.025-3.2 mg/kg) did not significantly alter the basal firing rate or pattern of either spontaneously active SNC or VTA DA neurons compared to vehicle-treated controls. The acute i.p. administration of either 1 or 10 mg/kg of SB-243213 did not significantly alter the number of spontaneously active DA cells in the SNC or VTA compared to vehicle-treated controls, whereas the 3 mg/kg dose only significantly decreased the number of spontaneously active VTA DA neurons. Overall, the 1 mg/kg dose of SB-243213 did not significantly alter the firing pattern of either SNC or VTA DA neurons compared to vehicle-treated controls. In contrast, the 3 mg/kg dose significantly altered the firing pattern of SNC DA neurons, whereas the 10 mg/kg dose altered the firing pattern of DA neurons in both the SNC and VTA. The repeated i.p. administration (21 days) of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg of SB-243213 or 20 mg/kg of clozapine produced a significant decrease in the number of spontaneously active DA cells in the VTA compared to vehicle-treated controls. The decrease in the number of spontaneously active VTA DA cells was not reversed by the i.v. administration of (+)-apomorphine (50 microg/kg). The repeated administration of either 1 or 3 mg/kg of SB-243213 had minimal effects on the firing pattern of either SNC or VTA DA neurons. In contrast, the firing pattern of VTA DA neurons was significantly altered by 10 mg/kg dose of SB-243213. Overall, our results indicate that antagonism of the 5-HT2C receptor alters the activity of midbrain DA neurons in anesthetized rats and suggest that SB-243213 has an atypical antipsychotic profile following chronic administration.
