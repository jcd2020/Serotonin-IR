Semenova, T. P. and M. K. Tiku (1997). "Interactions between the serotoninergic and noradrenergic systems of the brain and their role in the regulation of animal behavior." Neurosci Behav Physiol 27(3): 280-282.

	Studies were carried out using DBA/2 mice on the relationship between the behavioral effects of antagonists of different types of 5-HT receptors and the level of activity of alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The 5-HT1c receptor antagonists mianserin (2 mg/kg) and cyproheptadine (2 mg/kg) and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (3 mg/kg) had no effect on movement activity, while the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptor antagonists zacopride (1 mg/kg) and ICS 205-930 (1 mg/kg) reduced movement behavior in intact animals. On a background of treatment with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor blocker yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg), mianserin, cyproheptadine, and ketanserin inhibited movement activity and significantly reduced the sensitivity of animals to audiogenic convulsions. These data indicate that administration of alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonists increases the efficiency with which serotonin receptors regulate behavior.
