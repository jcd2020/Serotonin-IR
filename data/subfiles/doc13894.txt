	The interactions of serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C/2 and 5-HT3 receptor subtypes with apomorphine-induced locomotor activity (AILA) were investigated in Sprague-Dawley rats. The 5-HT3 antagonists ondansetron and ICS 205-930 had no significant effects on AILA. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) produced an increase in locomotor activity that was independent of DA neurotransmission. The locomotor activity induced by co-administration of apomorphine (APO; 0.25 mg/kg) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.251. 0 mg/kg) was not significantly higher than those induced by APO alone during the peak period of APO stimulation of locomotor activity, nor were they higher than activity induced by 8-OH-DPAT alone during the same time intervals. The 5-HT, antagonist (1)-propranolol had a depressant effect on AILA, but only at high doses. Co-administration of (1)-propranolol (5 mg/kg) and 8-OH-DPAT (1.0 mg/kg) elevated spontaneous locomotor activity for the first 10 min of the session when compared to 8-OH-DPAT (1.0 mg/kg) alone. The 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin along with moderate and high doses of mesulergine depressed AILA, effects which may be mediated by the 5-HT, antagonist properties of these drugs, by non-specific sedation or by direct effects of these compounds on DA D2 receptors. In contrast to the high-dose mesulergine depression of AILA, a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) of mesulergine elevated AILA, an effect which was blocked by the 5-HT1C/2 agonist 1-(2,-5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl) -2-aminopropane (DOI; 1 mg/kg). Neither of these compounds at the doses tested had significant effects on spontaneous locomotor activity. In addition, stereotypy was increased in rats co-administered DOI and APO. These findings suggest that the 5-HT1C and possibly the 5-HT2 receptor subtypes are prime targets for drug interventions intended to modulate DA neurotransmission.
