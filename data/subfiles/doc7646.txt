Loucif, A. J., et al. (2006). "Gender-dependent regulation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium current in dorsal raphe neurons in knock-out mice devoid of the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter." J Neurobiol 66(13): 1475-1488.

	Agonists at G-protein-coupled receptors in neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of knock-out mice devoid of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT(-/-)) exhibit lower efficacy to inhibit cellular discharge than in wild-type counterparts. Using patch-clamp whole-cell recordings, we found that a G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) current is involved in the inhibition of spike discharge induced by 5-HT1A agonists (5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and (+/-)-2-dipropylamino-8-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT); 50 nM-30 microM) in both wild-type and 5-HTT(-/-) female and male mice. These effects were mimicked by 5'-guanylyl-imido-diphosphate (Gpp(NH)p; 400 microM) dialysis into cells with differences between genders. The 5-HTT(-/-) knock-out mutation reduced the current density induced by Gpp(NH)p in females but not in males. These data suggest that the decreased response of 5-HT1A receptors to agonists in 5-HTT(-/-) mutants reflects notably alteration in the coupling between G-proteins and GIRK channels in females but not in males. Accordingly, gender differences in central 5-HT neurotransmission appear to depend-at least in part-on sex-related variations in corresponding receptor-G protein signaling mechanisms.
