Montero, D., et al. (1991). "Acute or chronic antidepressants do not modify [125I]cyanopindolol binding to 5-HT1B receptors in rat brain." Eur J Pharmacol 196(3): 327-329.

	Acute or chronic treatment of young or adult rats with chlorimipramine, tianeptine or iprindole, antidepressants with different effects on 5-HT uptake mechanisms, did not modify the density or the affinity of 5-HT1B receptors of the frontal cortex. No significant receptor change was found after prenatal exposure to these antidepressants. The lack of effect of the antidepressants was not related to the density of 5-HT1B receptors, which was significantly lower in younger animals.
