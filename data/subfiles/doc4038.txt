Grunder, G., et al. (1997). "Time course of 5-HT2A receptor occupancy in the human brain after a single oral dose of the putative antipsychotic drug MDL 100,907 measured by positron emission tomography." Neuropsychopharmacology 17(3): 175-185.

	MDL 100,907 is a potent and selective antagonist of 5-HT2A serotonin receptors. Animal studies suggest that MDL 100,907 may behave as an atypical antipsychotic drug. Positron emission tomograph (PET) using [C-11]NMSP as the radiotracer was used to define the time course of 5-HT2 receptor occupancy in the human frontal cerebral cortex after a single oral dose of MDL 100,907 (10 or 20 mg) in nine healthy subjects. After the baseline scan each subject was studied three times post dosing at various time points. 5-HT2 occupancies were in the range of 70 and 90% after each dose. While the occupancy remains in this range over 24 hours after 20 mg MDL 100,907, it decreases by about 20% at 24 Hours compared to the timepoint at 8 hours, when only 10 mg are administered (p < 0.05). Our results should allow determination of the appropriate dosing regimen for future trials in schizophrenic patients. (C) 1997 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.
