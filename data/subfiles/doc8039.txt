	Serotonin (5-HT) receptor 2A (5-HT2A) and 2C (5-HT2C) agonists have been reported to facilitate female rat lordosis behaviour. This study investigated the acute effects of the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI ((+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane) and the 5-HT2C receptor agonist MK-212 (2-chloro-6-(1-piperazinyl) pyrazine) on paced mating behaviour in a population of sexually receptive female rats in order to explore the role of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in the mediation of female rat sexual motivation. DOI (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) increased female rat sexual motivation during the first of two consecutive copulatory series seen as a tendency towards a decrease in return latencies following ejaculation and decreased inter-intromission intervals. MK-212 generally increased approach latencies. 0.5 mg/kg MK-212 increased post-ejaculatory exit latency, while 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg MK-212 increased both post-ejaculatory exit latencies and post-ejaculatory return latencies. The possibility that an increased level of anxiety confounded the effects of MK-212 on sexual motivation behaviour is discussed. The results may support the hypothesis that both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors are important in regulation of female sexual behaviour.
