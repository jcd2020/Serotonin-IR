Quartermain, D., et al. (1993). "5-HT1A AGONISTS DISRUPT MEMORY OF FEAR CONDITIONING IN MICE." Biological Psychiatry 33(4): 247-254.

	A series of experiments was carried out to analyze the effects of the 5-HT1A agonists tandospirone or buspirone on the retention of fear conditioning in mice. Fear was produced by pairing tone and shock in a conditioned emotional response (CER) paradigm and strength of conditioning was assessed by measuring suppression of drinking in presence of tone. Fear conditioning was disrupted if tandospirone and buspirone were administered before the conditioning session but not before the test trial. Diazepam disrupted conditioning at both times. Tandospirone did not disrupt performance if conditioning was tested 1 hr rather than 24 hr after training, suggesting that disrupted memory rather than impaired acquisition was responsible for the deficit. The effect of tandospirone on fear conditioning could be reversed by administration of d-amphetamine prior to the retention test, which suggests that information was stored but is inaccessible to normal retrieval cues. Tandospirone and buspirone also retarded extinction, a clear indication that the disruption caused by these drugs is unrelated to their anxiolytic action.
