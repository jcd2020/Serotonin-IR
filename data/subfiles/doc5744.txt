Idova, G., et al. (2008). "Serotoninergic mechanisms of immunomodulation under different psychoemotional states: I. A role of 5-HT 1A receptor subtype." Int J Neurosci 118(11): 1594-1608.

	The present study demonstrates the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT 1A type in immunoinhibitory effect of 5-HTergic system of the brain. A selective agonist of 5-HT 1A receptors 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) induces the immunosuppression, whereas 5-HT 1A blockade with WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg) resulted in immunostimulation. It is also shown that immunomodulating effects of the drugs were dependent on psychoemotional status of animals acquired aggressive or submissive behavior under social conflict conditions. Activation of 5-HT 1A receptors produced a decrease of the immunity in aggressive mice, whereas 5-HT 1A receptor blockade caused immunostimulation in submissive animals.
