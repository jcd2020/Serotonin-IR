	The effects of melatonin and melatonin analogs in experimental Parkinson's disease (PD) models remain controversial. Agomelatine, a novel analog of melatonin, is both agonists for melatonin-1 and melatonin-2 receptors and antagonist of 5-HT2C receptors. While agomelatine has been commonly used as an anti-depressant and sleep drug, information about effects of agomelatine in PD are still lacking. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (220-260 g) were injected with rotenone (0.5 mu g, n = 16) or vehicle (1 mu l DMSO, n = 8) into the left substantia nigra (SN) and ventral tegmental area under stereotaxic surgery. After ten days, the rats were assessed for the confirmation of PD by the rotational test following apomorphine injection (2 mg/kg, i.p.). The confirmed rats were divided into two groups which received daily p.o. agomelatine (40 mg/kg, n = 8) or saline (2 ml/rat, n = 8) for consecutively 18 days. Twenty-four hours after the last drug administration, the rotational test was repeated and motor coordination was assesed just before the decapitation. Brain tissues were taken for biochemical, molecular and histopathological evaluations. Agomelatine treated animals showed augmented apomorphine-induced rotation response and impaired motor coordination compared to the rotenone group. Furthermore, agomelatine treatment significantly induced apoptosis with an increase in caspase-3 expression independent from PARP-1 activation. Agomelatine treatment caused increased protein oxidation levels, in addition to a decrease in neuron number in the striatum. Although we investigated the effects of the agomelatine in the manner of ameliorating the rotenone toxicity in animals, agomelatine exacerbates rotenone-induced toxicity which mimics Parkinson's disease pathology.
