Flaherty, C. F., et al. (1990). "Effect of serotonergic drugs on negative contrast in consummatory behavior." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 36(4): 799-806.

	The effect of acute and chronic administration of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone on successive negative contrast was investigated in Experiments 1-6. Contrast in consummatory behavior was induced by shifting rats from a 32% to a 4% sucrose solution. Experiments 1-5 showed that buspirone (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 15.0 mg/kg) was ineffective in alleviating contrast or in facilitating recovery from contrast. The 15 mg/kg dose substantially decreased consummatory responding. Experiment 6 showed that the chronic (24 days) administration of buspirone (0.5, 2.0 mg/kg) also did not alleviate contrast. The chronic, but not the acute administration of the 2.0 mg/kg dose decreased consummatory behavior. In Experiment 7 the 5-HT1A agonist gepirone (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg) was also found to be ineffective in reducing contrast but, at the higher doses, decreased overall sucrose intake. Experiments 8 and 9 found that the 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin (2.0 and 8.0 mg/kg) and ritanserin (0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg) also did not alleviate contrast. Midazolam (1.0 mg/kg), included as a positive control, eliminated contrast. These data suggest that serotonergic mechanisms are not involved in negative contrast.
