Dzoljic, M. R., et al. (1992). "5-HT1-LIKE RECEPTOR AGONISTS ENHANCE WAKEFULNESS." Neuropharmacology 31(7): 623-633.

	The effects of four 5-HT1-like receptor agonists (8-OH-DPAT, RU 24969, BEA 1654 and 5-carboxamidotryptamine) and some putative 5-HT1-like receptor antagonists on vigilance were examined in an attempt to clarify the role of 5-HT1-like receptors in the sleep-waking pattern of rats. Both 8-OH-DPAT (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and RU 24969 (0.5-2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) increased wakefulness and the latencies of slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The slow wave and REM sleep were correspondingly decreased or completely abolished. The two other 5-HT1-like receptor agonists had either a slight (BEA 1654, 1.0-5.0 mg/kg, s.c.) or no (5-carboxamidotryptamine, 0.5-2.0 mg/kg, s.c.) effect on sleep pattern. The arousal effect of 8-OH-DPAT was further potentiated in rats pretreated with reserpine (2.5 mg/kg, i.p.; 18 hr before 8-OH-DPAT). The non-selective 5-HT1-like and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, methiothepin (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (16.0 mg/kg, s.c.), which is a putative antagonist at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor subtypes, significantly potentiated the arousal effect of RU 24969. The putative 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, cyanopindolol (4.0 mg/kg, s.c.), mixed 5-HT1A receptor agonist/antagonist MDL 72832 (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and the alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (2.0 mg/kg) did not affect the vigilance, altered by RU 24969. These results suggest that the arousal effect of 5-HT1-like receptor agonists is probably not mediated by any of the subtypes of 5-HT1-like receptors or by an activation of a noradrenergic system.
