	OBJECTIVE: The ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in initiation and control of voluntary movement, mood and cognition. However, after the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway, the neuronal activity of the ventral mPFC and the role of serotonin(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT(1A)) receptors in the firing of the neurons are still unknown. The present study is to investigate the change of neuronal activity in the ventral mPFC and the effect of systemic administration of the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 on the activity of the neurons in normal and 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. METHODS: Single unit responses were recorded extracellularly with glass microelectrodes from ventral mPFC neurons in normal rats and 6-OHDA unilaterally lesioned rats in vivo. RESULTS: 6-OHDA lesion of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) significantly increased the firing rate with no change in the firing pattern of neurons of the ventral mPFC in rats. Systemic administration of WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) did not change the mean firing rate and firing pattern of ventral mPFC neurons in normal rats. In contrast, WAY-100635 significantly decreased the mean firing rate of the neurons in rats with 6-OHDA lesion of the SNc. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway results in an increase of neuronal activity of ventral mPFC and dysfunction of 5-HT(1A) receptor.
