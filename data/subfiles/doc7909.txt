	Disturbance of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators is thought to underlie the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies of 15q dup mouse models of ASD with human 15q11-13 duplication have revealed that restoring serotonin (5-HT) levels can partially reverse ASD-related symptoms in adults. However, it remains unclear how serotonin contributes to the behavioral symptoms of ASD. In contrast, oxytocin (OXT) has been found to involve social and affiliative behaviors. In this study, we examined whether serotonin-OXT interaction during the early postnatal period plays a critical role in the restoration of social abnormality in 15q dup mice. OXT or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8OH-DPAT treatment from postnatal day 7 (PD7) to PD21 ameliorated social abnormality in the three-chamber social interaction test in adult 15q dup mice. The effect of 8OH-DPAT was inhibited by blockade of OXT receptors in 15q dup mice. Thus, serotonin-OXT interaction via 5-HT1A receptors plays a critical role in the normal development of social behavior in 15q dup mice. Therefore, targeting serotonin-OXT interaction may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of ASD.
