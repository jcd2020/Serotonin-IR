	Binding characteristics of a radioiodinated serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist, 4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-(n-2"-pyridinyl)-p- iodobenzamido]-ethyl-piperazine ([125I]p-MPPI) were evaluated using in vitro homogenate binding and autoradiographic techniques in rat brains. [125I]p-MPPI displayed a Kd value of 0.32 +/- 0.04 nM (in the presence of MgCl2) and a Bmax value of 315 +/- 60 fmol/mg of protein in rat hippocampal homogenates. The number of 5-HT1A receptors labeled by [125I]p-MPPI was 40% higher than that labeled by trans-8-hydroxy-2-(N-n-propyl-N-3'-iodo-2'- propenyl)aminotetralin ([125I]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT) (225 +/- 47 fmol/mg of protein), a radioiodinated 5-HT1A agonist. The magnesium ion showed an inhibitory effect on [125I]p-MPPI binding but increased the specific binding of [125I]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT. A significant increase in Bmax values in the presence of guanyl nucleotides was observed for [125I]p-MPPI (control, 307 +/- 35 fmol/mg of protein; with GTP, 345 +/- 30 fmol/mg of protein; with guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, 362 +/- 35 fmol/mg of protein); however, both guanyl nucleotides significantly reduced the Bmax values measured by [125I]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT (control, 213 +/- 50 fmol/mg of protein; with GTP, 133 +/- 20 fmol/mg of protein; with guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, 108 +/- 20 fmol/mg of protein). The binding characteristics of [125I]p-MPPI for 5-HT1A receptors suggest that p-MPPI is an antagonist for 5-HT1A receptors. In vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain sections with [125I]p-MPPI showed specific labeling of areas rich in 5-HT1A receptors and the regional distribution closely matched those labeled by [125I]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
