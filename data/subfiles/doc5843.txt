	Tianeptine is a novel antidepressant that uniquely facilitates 5-HT uptake, as exemplified by its ability, when given acutely to rats, to reduce 5-HTP-induced wet-dog shakes and hippocampal 5-HT efflux. The present study examined whether these effects persisted after its chronic administration. After injecting tianeptine (10 mg/kg i.p.) daily for 4 weeks it no longer attenuated 5-HTP-induced wet-dog shakes. This was not due to a reduced sensitivity of 5-HT2A receptors, which mediate 5-HTP-induced wet-dog shakes, because responses to the directly acting agonist, DOI were unaffected. However, in vivo microdialysis studies demonstrated that tianeptine reduced hippocampal 5-HT efflux in response to 5-HTP to the same extent as after acute administration and that when 5-HTP was given 24 h after the last of the series of chronic injections, 5-HT efflux was similar to that observed in control rats. These results demonstrate that attenuation of tianeptine's ability to reduce the behavioural effects of 5-HTP after chronic administration cannot be explained by a similar effect on 5-HT reuptake.
