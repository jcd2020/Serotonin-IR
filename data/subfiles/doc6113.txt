Johnson, E. A., et al. (1996). "The anxiolytic serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists buspirone, ipsapirone and gepirone are inhibitors of tyrosine hydroxylation in rat striatum." Behav Brain Res 73(1-2): 331-335.

	The anxiolytics buspirone (BUS), ipsapirone (IPSAP) and gepirone (GEP) were investigated as 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibitors of tyrosine hydroxylation (TH) in a synaptosome-rich preparation of rat striatum. BUS, IPSAP and GEP were moderately potent inhibitors of TH with EC50 values of 48.4 microM, 50 microM and 836 microM, respectively. By comparison, 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor selective agonist, has been previously shown to be more potent with an EC50 value of 7.0 microM. Each of these agents demonstrated full agonist activity at the striatal 5-HT1A receptors regulating TH. The inhibitory effects of each agent were attenuated by prior exposure to the 5-HT1A antagonist NAN-190, (10 microM) (P < 0.05), but not by the dopamine D2 antagonist (-)-sulpiride (10 microM). The potencies of 8-OH-DPAT, BUS, IPSAP and GEP were correlated with their reported affinities for the 5-HT1A receptor (P < 0.01) but not the dopamine D2 receptor. These results support the hypothesis that BUS, IPSAP and GEP inhibit TH through activation of a striatal 5-HT1A heteroreceptor on dopamine nerve terminals.
