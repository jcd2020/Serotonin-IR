	Previous studies from this and another laboratory demonstrated that in utero ethanol exposure reduces 5-HT neurons and S100B-immunopositive glia that are proximal to these neurons. Our laboratory also found that these effects are prevented by maternal treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist. Because of S100B's important role in the development of 5-HT neurons, the present study used both in vivo and in vitro models to investigate the potential involvement of S100B with the damaging effects of ethanol and with the protective effects of 5-HT1A agonists. We used in situ hybridization to address whether a 5-HT1A agonist could potentially affect S100B mRNA in vivo. Maternal treatment with buspirone between gestation days 13 and 20 significantly increased S100B mRNA in neuroepithelium of G20 offspring of control (40%) and ethanol-fed dams (20%). However, S100B mRNA was not altered in neuroepithelium from ethanol-exposed offspring. In astroglial cultures, we examined whether ethanol reduces the release of S100B and whether a 5-HT1A agonist could stimulate the release of this protein. We also evaluated the effects of ethanol and ipsapirone on astroglial content of S100B. Neither the concentration of S100B in astroglial media nor astroglial content of S100B were affected by ethanol. However, treatment with 100 nM ipsapirone, a 5-HT1A agonist, between the 6th and 7th day in vitro, increased astroglial release of S100B 2- to 3-fold. Thus, the protective effects of a 5-HT1A agonist on ethanol-treated 5-HT neurons might be associated with the ability of these drugs to release the neurotrophic factor S100B from astrocytes.
