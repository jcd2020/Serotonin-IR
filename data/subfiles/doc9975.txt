Schmeer, C. and L. Lima (2000). "Modulation of outgrowth from goldfish retinal explants by a 5-HT2 receptor agonist and H-3 ketanserin binding sites in goldfish and rabbit retina." Vision Research 40(1): 33-40.

	The binding of [H-3]ketanserin to goldfish and rabbit retinal membrane preparations and the possible role of 5-HT2A receptors in the in vitro outgrowth from goldfish retina were evaluated. Saturation experiments indicated a high-affinity binding site, and positive cooperativity for both tissues. The 5-HT2A/2C agonist (+/-)-2,5-dimetoxy-4-iodoamphetamine and serotonin inhibited outgrowth from goldfish retinal explants. These effects were blocked by the 5-HT2 antagonists ketanserin and 1-(1-naphthyl)piperazine and by the 5-HT2C antagonist mesulergine, respectively. Results make to suggest that [H-3]ketanserin binds to 5-HT2A receptors in the rabbit and goldfish retina, but also to a monoamine transporter in the latter tissue. Subtypes of 5-HT2 receptors might mediate the 5-HT modulatory role on in vitro outgrowth of the goldfish retina. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
