McLean, J. H., et al. (2009). "A phosphodiesterase inhibitor, cilomilast, enhances cAMP activity to restore conditioned odor preference memory after serotonergic depletion in the neonate rat." Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 92(1): 63-69.

	In various learning and memory models, preventing the breakdown of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (CAMP) by using a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor promotes memory. In the rat pup odor preference learning model serotonin, acting through 5-HT2A/C receptors, has been shown to influence cAMP levels in the olfactory bulb initiated by beta-adrenoceptor activation, as also seen in the neocortex. Since depletion of olfactory bulb serotonin prevents learning in the rat pup odor preference model, we ask whether a PDE inhibitor could restore that learning and also examined the influence of these manipulations on the temporal bulbar CAMP signal associated with successful learning. In this study, we found that a PDE4 inhibitor overcame learning deficits seen 24 h after a 10 min training trial on postnatal day 6 using the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol as the unconditioned stimulus. We found in a previous study, that use of a PDE4 inhibitor during learning in normal pups extended memory to more than 48 h. However, in the present study the PDE4 treatment did not enable this memory extension in 5-HT depleted pups. An increase in the cAMP signal at the end of the 10 min training trial occurred in the presence of the PDE4 inhibitor. Such a cAMP increase has been associated with successful learning and is normally absent with bulbar 5-HT depletion. These results suggest PDE4 inhibitors may be useful therapeutically in disorders associated with reductions in serotonergic function. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
