Kitamura, Y., et al. (2008). "Increased DOI-induced wet-dog shakes in adrenocorticotropic hormone-treated rats are not affected by chronic imipramine treatment: possible involvement of enhanced 5-HT(2A)-receptor expression in the frontal cortex." J Pharmacol Sci 106(1): 100-106.

	We examined the influence of imipramine, a traditional tricyclic antidepressant, on the binding to serotonin (5-HT)(2) receptors and levels of 5-HT(2A)-receptor mRNA in the frontal cortex of rats treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Chronic treatment with ACTH significantly increased the binding of [(3)H]-ketanserin to 5-HT(2) receptors and the expression of 5-HT(2A)-receptor mRNA in the frontal cortex. However, it did not alter the concentration of 5-HT or 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid. The effect of chronic ACTH treatment on 5-HT(2) receptor and 5-HT(2A)-receptor mRNA levels was not altered by the chronic administration of imipramine. Also, imipramine did not affect the hyperfunction of 5-HT(2A) receptors caused by chronic ACTH treatment. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with ACTH acts to increase 5-HT(2A)-receptor synthesis through increased gene transcription, without modulating presynaptic serotonergic neurotransmission.
