	The ability of nineteen tryptamine derivatives to interact with putative 5-hydroxytryptamine 1D (5-HT1D) receptor binding sites in bovine caudate was analyzed. Sixteen of the nineteen agents competed, with variable potency, for these binding sites with Hill slopes of approximately unity. By contrast, 5-carboxyamidotryptamine (5-CT), sumatriptan and 5-benzyloxytryptamine (5-BT) competed with Hill slope values significantly less than unity. These three drugs share, in comparison to the sixteen other tryptamines, relatively large substitutions at the 5-position of the indole moiety. Additional radioligand binding studies with 5-BT indicate that the drug shows relative selectivity for 5-HT 1D/1B binding sites. Functionally, 5-BT and sumatriptan inhibit H-5-HT release from guinea pig cortical synaptosomes with equal potency but 5-BT is significantly less efficacious than sumatriptan. These data indicate that 5-BT is a relatively selective partial agonist at 5-HT1D receptors.
