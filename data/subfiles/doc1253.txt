Boulenguez, P., et al. (1991). "A NEW 5-HYDROXY-INDOLE DERIVATIVE WITH PREFERENTIAL AFFINITY FOR 5-HT1B BINDING-SITES." European Journal of Pharmacology 194(1): 91-98.

	The affinities of several 5-hydroxy-indole derivatives for serotonin-1 (5-HT1) binding site subtypes, labeled with 2 nM [H-3]5-HT, were assessed by quantitative autoradiography on rat brain sections. The results obtained with known ligands, namely 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-methoxytryptamine (5-Me-OT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine (5-Me-ODMT), 5-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine (bufotenine) and 8-hydroxy-2-[di-N-propylamino]tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) demonstrate the reliability and the advantages of this technique for pharmacological studies. Novel serotonin derivatives were synthesized by carboxymethylation of the hydroxyl group. One of those new ligands, serotonin-O-carboxy-methyl-glycyl-tyrosinamide (S-CM-GTNH2), inhibited 2 nM [H-3]5-HT binding to the substantia nigra with an IC50 of 22.4 nM, a value which is 22 times lower than that found in the dentate gyrus and choroid plexus. This demonstrates the preferential affinity of S-CM-GTNH2 for 5-HT1B versus 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C binding sites. S-CM-GTNH2 contains a tyrosine residue, which may be useful for the synthesis of a radioactive iodinated molecule and for the preparation of 'long-lasting ligands' linked through peptide bonds with a protein. These derivatives could be of great interest for ultrastructural and behavioral studies relevant to 5-HT1B sites.
