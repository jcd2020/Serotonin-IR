Chalmers, D. T., et al. (1994). "Regulation of hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor gene expression by dexamethasone." Neuropsychopharmacology 10(3): 215-222.

	The effect of dexamethasone, a selective GR agonist, on hippocampal, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression and 5-HT1A binding was examined using in situ hybridization histochemistry and in vitro receptor autoradiography. One week after adrenalectomy, both 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression and 5-HT1A binding were increased throughout the hippocampus. Administration of dexamethasone at the time of adrenalectomy significantly attenuated the increases in 5-HT1A mRNA expression in all hippocampal subfields (p < .05, Fisher Test), although 5-HT1A mRNA levels remained significantly higher than sham levels in all subfields with the exception of CA1. However, 5-HT1A binding levels were responsive to dexamethasone administration only within particular hippocampal subfields, CA1, and dentate gyrus. We conclude that GR occupation negatively regulates 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression within the hippocampus and that 5-HT1A receptor sites are most sensitive to modulation in those hippocampal subfields expressing higher levels of GR receptors.
