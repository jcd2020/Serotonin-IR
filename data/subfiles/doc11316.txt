	Immobilization stress decreases the expression of BDNF mRNA in the rat hippocampus, and this effect could contribute to the atrophy of hippocampal neurons. This study examines the influence of selective 5-HT, as well as norepinephrine, receptor antagonists on the stress-induced down-regulation of BDNF mRNA. Pretreatment with a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, MDL100,907, significantly blocked the influence of stress on expression of BDNF mRNA. In contrast, pretreatment with either a selective 5-HT2c or 5-HT1A receptor antagonist did not influence the stress-induced decrease in levels of BDNF mRNA. The stress-induced decrease was also not influenced by pretreatment with antagonists of beta(1/2)- or alpha(1)-adrenergic, or CRF-R1 receptors, The results demonstrate that 5-HT2A receptors mediate, at least in part, the stress-induced down-regulation of BDNF expression in the rat hippocampus.
