Romero, L., et al. (2003). "Modulation of serotonergic function in rat brain by VN2222, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor agonist." Neuropsychopharmacology 28(3): 445-456.

	VN2222 (1-(benzo[b]thiophen-3-yl)-3-[4-(2-methoxiphenyl piperazin-1-yl]propan-1-ol) is a potential antidepressant with high affinity for the serotonin transporter and 5-HT(1A) receptors. Locally applied, VN2222 enhanced the extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) concentration (5-HT(ext)) in rat striatum to 780% of baseline whereas its systemic administration (1-10 mg/kg s.c.) reduced 5-HT(ext). In the presence of citalopram, 8-OH-DPAT or VN2222 applied in medial prefrontal cortex reduced 5-HT(ext). Fluoxetine, VN2222, and 8-OH-DPAT suppressed the firing rate of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons (ED(50): 790, 14.9, and 0.8 microg/kg i.v., respectively). These effects were antagonized by WAY 100635. Administration of VN2222 for 2 weeks desensitized 5-HT(1A) receptors as assessed by microdialysis and single-unit recordings (ED(50) values for 8-OH-DPAT were 0.45 and 2.34 microg/kg i.v. for controls and rats treated with 6 mg/kg day VN2222). These results show that VN2222 is a mixed 5-HT reuptake inhibitor/5-HT(1A) agonist that markedly desensitizes 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. These properties suggest that it may be a clinically effective dual action antidepressant drug.
