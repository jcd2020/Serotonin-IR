Tohyama, Y., et al. (2001). "Effects of selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonists on regional serotonin synthesis in the rat brain: An autoradiographic study with alpha- C-14 methyl-L-tryptophan." European Neuropsychopharmacology 11(3): 193-202.

	The effects of acute and chronic administration of WAY 100635 and WAY100135, serotonin (5-HT)(1A) antagonists, on 5-HT synthesis rates, calculated from the trapping of alpha-[C-14]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha -MTrp). were evaluated in the rat brain using autoradiography. In the acute treatment studies, WAY100635 (1 mg/kg) induced a significant increase in 5-HT synthesis in the median raphe nucleus and some nerve terminal structures (range between 18 and 53%), while WAY 100135 (10 mg/kg) produced a significant decrease of synthesis, in the range between 16 and 33%, in the raphe magnus nucleus and several projection areas. The action of WAY 100635 given acutely was likely a result of antagonist actions at the 5-HT1A somato-dendritic autoreceptors. WAY 100135 probably acted acutely as a partial agonist. In the chronic treatment studies, WAY100635 (1 mg/kg/day) and WAY100135 (10 mg/kg/day) were administered for 7 days as s.c. injections once a day. Chronic treatment with both compounds significantly reduced the rate of 5-HT synthesis in, the nerve terminal structures and produced a significant increase in the raphe nuclei. These treatments did not have any effect on the plasma free or total tryptophan. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V./ECNP. All rights reserved.
