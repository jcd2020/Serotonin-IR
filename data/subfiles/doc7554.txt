Miyazato, H., et al. (2000). "Serotonergic modulation of the P13 midlatency auditory evoked potential in the rat." Brain Res Bull 51(5): 387-391.

	The vertex-recorded, sleep state-dependent P13 midlatency auditory evoked potential in the rat may be generated, in part, by pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) projections. Injections into the PPN of the 5-HT(1A) serotonin receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylaminotetralin hydrobromide (DPAT), were found to reduce the amplitude of the P13 potential in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The suppressive effect of DPAT was blocked or reduced by pretreatment with the 5-HT(1A) serotonin receptor antagonist, Pindobind. These results show that the P13 potential can be modulated by known inhibitory serotonergic inputs to the PPN.
