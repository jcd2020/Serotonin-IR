	The aim of the present study was to identify 5-hydroxytryptamine(7) (5-HT7) binding sites in the mouse ileum, where the presence of mRNA for the receptor has been reported. Studies were performed using [H-3]mesulergine, an antagonist with high affinity at 5-HT7 receptors. In the presence of a combination of masking drugs to inhibit the binding of the radioligand to other receptors at which it has affinity, such as 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and dopamine D-2 receptors as well as alpha(1)/alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, [H-3]mesulergine labelled two sites with pK(D) values of 9.7 +/- 0.7 and 7.4 +/- 0.4 and B-max values of 37.2 +/- 21.4 and 247.8 +/- 62.1 fmol mg protein(-1), respectively. Displacement studies also indicated the presence of non-homogenous binding sites, which showed a significant correlation (Pearson correlation factors of 0.91 and 0.85) with the 5-HT2C and 5-HT7 receptors, respectively. Total binding to the 5-HT2C receptor was minimal; < 30% of the total specific receptor binding. The antagonist order of affinity at the greater proportion of receptors was: risperidone (pK(i):9.7) > lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 9.4) > metergoline (7.7) > mesulergine (7.5) > ritanserin (6.3) > pindolol (5.6). This receptor also showed a high affinity for 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT; 10.6) and moderate affinity for (+/-)-2-dipropyl-amino-8-hydroxy-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydronaphthalene (8-OH-DPAT; 7.2), which is typical of the 5-HT7 receptor profile.
