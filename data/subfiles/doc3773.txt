Giuliano, F. (2007). "5-hydroxytryptamine in premature ejaculation: opportunities for therapeutic intervention." Trends in Neurosciences 30(2): 79-84.

	Ejaculation, although mediated by a spinal ejaculation generator, is subject to descending supraspinal modulation from several brain regions. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) is involved in ejaculatory control, with its ejaculation-retarding effects likely to be attributable to activation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors, both spinally and supraspinally. By contrast, stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors precipitates ejaculation. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are used for treatment of psychiatric disorders, can delay ejaculation in humans and are widely used 'off-label' for treatment of premature ejaculation. SSRIs require 1-2 weeks' chronic dosing to be effective, similar to their use for treatment of depression. However, a new short-acting SSRI is effective 'on demand' and might represent the first of a new generation of therapies targeted to premature ejaculation.
