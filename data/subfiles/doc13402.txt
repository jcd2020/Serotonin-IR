	Prior research suggests that midbrain serotonergic signaling and hypothalamic ghrelinergic signaling both play critical roles in appetitive and emotional behaviors. In the present study, we investigated the effects of median raphe nucleus (MRN) somatodentritic 5-HT1A receptor activation on the feeding-stimulant and anxiogenic action of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) ghrelin. In an initial experiment, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with either ghrelin (200-800 pmol) into the PVN or 8-OH-DPAT (2.5-10 nmol), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, into the MRN. Performance on the elevated plus maze (EPM) was then assessed. In separate rats, MRN 8-OH-DPAT (2.5-5 nmol) was administered 5 min prior to PVN injection of ghrelin (400 pmol) followed by EPM testing. The orexigenic effects of MRN 8-OH-DPAT (0.1-1.6 nmol) paired with PVN ghrelin (50 pmol) were also examined. When administered alone into the PVN, ghrelin significantly decreased the number of entries and time spent in the open arms of the EPM. This anxiogenic effect was blocked if rats were allowed to eat immediately after ghrelin administration and then tested in the plus maze. MRN injections of 8-OH-DPAT were anxiolytic, and when rats were pretreated with 8-OH-DPAT prior to ghrelin, the anxiogenic action of the peptide was attenuated. In contrast, MRN administration of 8-OH-DPAT potentiated the eating-stimulant effect of PVN ghrelin. Overall, our findings demonstrate that ghrelinergic and serotonergic circuits interact in the neural control of eating and anxiety-like behaviors, with 5-HT1A receptor mechanisms potentiating the orexigenic action of ghrelin while inhibiting ghrelin-induced anxiogenesis as measured via the EPM.
