Boido, A., et al. (2001). "Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of aryl/heteroaryl piperazinyl alkyl benzotriazoles as ligands for some serotonin and dopamine receptors subtypes." Farmaco 56(4): 263-275.

	Thirteen [(aryl/heteroaryl-piperazinyl)alkyl]benzotriazoles were prepared as potential trazodone- and buspirone-like drugs. The synthesized compounds displayed from moderate to good affinity to the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor and only modest or poor affinity to the dopamine D-2 receptor, similar to buspirone. The introduction of substituents on the benzotriazole ring did,not improve the affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor, compared to the previously described unsubstituted derivatives. In a general pharmacological screening, which concerned only three of these compounds so far (5, 7 and 13), several in vitro and in vivo activities were observed. The guinea pig ileum contractions, induced either electrically or by several agonists, were strongly inhibited; at higher concentrations also the spontaneous tone of the guinea pig trachea was reduced. Compound 13 exhibited good analgesic activity in mice in the formalin-induced algesia and in the writhing test. The same at 30 mg kg(-1) p.o. also displayed antihypertensive activity probably related to calcium channel blockade and adrenergic alpha(1) antagonism. In binding assays, 13 showed a IC50 = 580 nM for displacing [H-3]prazosin from alpha(1) receptor. Finally, compound 5 (and, to a minor extent, compound 13) protected mice against potassium cyanide induced hypoxia. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.
