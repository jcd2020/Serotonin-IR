Hassanain, M., et al. (2005). "Potentiating role of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and IL-1beta type 1 receptors in the medial hypothalamus in defensive rage behavior in the cat." Brain Res 1048(1-2): 1-11.

	Recently, this laboratory provided evidence that interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), an immune and brain-derived cytokine, microinjected into the medial hypothalamus, potentiates defensive rage behavior in the cat elicited from the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), and that such effects are blocked by a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. Since this finding represents the first time that a brain cytokine has been shown to affect defensive rage behavior, the present study replicated and extended these findings by documenting the specific potentiating role played by IL-1beta Type 1 receptor (IL-1RI), and the anatomical relationship between IL-1beta and 5-HT2 receptors in the medial hypothalamus. IL-1beta (10 ng) microinjected into the medial hypothalamus induced two separate phases of facilitation, one at 60 min and another at 180 min, post-injection. In turn, these effects were blocked with pretreatment of the selective IL-1 Type I receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) (10 ng), demonstrating the selectivity of the effects of IL-1beta on medial hypothalamic neurons upon PAG-elicited defensive rage behavior. The next stage of the study utilized immunohistochemical methods to demonstrate that IL-1beta and 5-HT2 receptors were present on the same neurons within regions of the medial hypothalamus where IL-1beta and the IL-1beta receptor antagonists were administered. This provided anatomical evidence suggesting a relationship between IL-1RI and 5-HT2 receptors in the medial hypothalamus that is consistent with the previous pharmacological observations in our laboratory. The overall findings show that activation of IL-1RI in the medial hypothalamus potentiates defensive rage behavior in the cat and that these effects may also be linked to the presence of 5-HT2 receptors on the same groups of neurons in this region of hypothalamus.
