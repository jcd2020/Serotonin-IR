	Background and purpose: Combining 5-HT1A receptor activation with dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor blockade should improve negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia. We describe the in vitro profile of F15063 ( N-[( 2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-7-yloxy) ethyl]-3-( cyclopent-1-enyl)-benzylamine). Experimental approach: F15063 was characterised in tests of binding affinity and in cellular models of signal transduction at monoamine receptors. Key results: Affinities ( receptor and pK(i) values) of F15063 were: rD(2) 9.38; hD(2L) 9.44; hD(2S) 9.25; hD(3) 8.95; hD(4) 8.81; h5-HT1A 8.37. F15063 had little affinity ( 40-fold lower than D-2) at other targets. F15063 antagonised dopamine-activated G-protein activation at hD(2), rD(2) and hD(3) receptors with potency ( pK(b) values 9.19, 8.29 and 8.74 in [ S-35] GTP gamma S binding experiments) similar to haloperidol. F15063 did not exhibit any hD(2) receptor agonism, even in tests of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and G-protein activation in cells with high receptor expression. In contrast, like ( +/-) 8-OH-DPAT, F15063 efficaciously activated h5-HT1A ( E-max 70%, pEC(50) 7.57) and r5-HT1A receptors ( 52%, 7.95) in tests of [ S-35] GTP gamma S binding, cAMP accumulation ( 90%, 7.12) and ERK1/2 phosphorylation ( 93%, 7.13). F15063 acted as a partial agonist for [ S-35] GTP gamma S binding at hD(4) ( 29%, 8.15) and h5-HT1D receptors ( 35%, 7.68). In [ S-35] GTP gamma S autoradiography, F15063 activated G-proteins in hippocampus, cortex and septum ( regions enriched in 5-HT1A receptors), but antagonised quinelorane-induced activation of D-2/D-3 receptors in striatum. Conclusions and implications: F15063 antagonised dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors, a property underlying its antipsychotic-like activity, whereas activation of 5-HT1A and D-4 receptors mediated its actions in models of negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia ( see companion papers).
