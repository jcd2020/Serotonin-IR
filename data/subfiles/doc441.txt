	Interaction with dopamine D-2-like receptors plays a major role in the therapeutic effects of antipsychotic drugs. We examined in vivo dopamine D-2 receptor occupancy of various established and potential antipsychotics in mouse striatum and olfactory tubercles 1 h after administration of the compound, using [H-3]nemonapride as a ligand. All the compounds reduced in vivo binding of [H-3]nemonapride in the striatum. When administered systemically, conventional antipsychotics, D-2 antagonists, nemonapride (ID50: 0.034 mg/kg), eticlopride (0.047), haloperidol (0.11) and raclopride (0.11) potently inhibited [H-3]nemonapride binding. The 'atypical' antipsychotics, risperidone (0.18), ziprasidone (0.38), aripiprazole (1.6), olanzapine (0.99), and clozapine (11.1) were less potent for occupying D-2-like receptors. New compounds, displaying marked agonism at 5-HT1A receptors in addition to D-2 receptor affinity, exhibited varying D-2 receptor occupancy: bifeprunox (0.25), SLV313 (0.78), SSR181507 (1.6) and sarizotan (6.7). ID50 values for inhibition of [H-3]nemonapride binding in the striatum correlated with those in the olfactory tubercles (r=0.95, P < 0.0001). These values also correlated with previously-reported in vitro affinity of the compounds at rat D-2 receptors (r=0.85, P=0.0001) and with inhibition of apomorphine-induced climbing in mice (r=0.79 P=0.0005). In contrast, there was no significant correlation between ID50 values herein and previously-reported ED50 values for catalepsy in mice. These data indicate that: (1) there is no difference in D-2 receptor occupancy in limbic versus striatal regions between most classical and atypical or potential antipsychotics; and (2) high occupancy of D-2 receptors can be dissociated from catalepsy, if the drugs also activate 5-HT1A receptors. Taken together, these data support the strategy of simultaneously targeting D-2 receptor blockade and 5-HT1A receptor activation for new antipsychotics.
