Shrestha, S. S., et al. (2016). "The 5-HT1A Receptor PET Radioligand 11C-CUMI-101 Has Significant Binding to alpha1-Adrenoceptors in Human Cerebellum, Limiting Its Use as a Reference Region." J Nucl Med 57(12): 1945-1948.

	Prazosin, a potent and selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, displaces 25% of (11)C-CUMI-101 ([O-methyl-(11)C]2-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-tr iazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione) binding in monkey cerebellum. We sought to estimate the percentage contamination of (11)C-CUMI-101 binding to alpha1-adrenoceptors in human cerebellum under in vivo conditions. In vitro receptor-binding techniques were used to measure alpha1-adrenoceptor density and the affinity of CUMI-101 for these receptors in human, monkey, and rat cerebellum. METHODS: Binding potential (maximum number of binding sites x affinity [(1/dissociation constant]) was determined using in vitro homogenate binding assays in human, monkey, and rat cerebellum. (3)H-prazosin was used to determine the maximum number of binding sites, as well as the dissociation constant of (3)H-prazosin and the inhibition constant of CUMI-101. RESULTS: alpha1-adrenoceptor density and the affinity of CUMI-101 for these receptors were similar across species. Cerebellar binding potentials were 3.7 for humans, 2.3 for monkeys, and 3.4 for rats. CONCLUSION: Reasoning by analogy, 25% of (11)C-CUMI-101 uptake in human cerebellum reflects binding to alpha1-adrenoceptors, suggesting that the cerebellum is of limited usefulness as a reference tissue for quantification in human studies.
