	5-HT receptors were studied in human occipital arteries, obtained from patients during neurosurgery. We detected mRNA for the following receptors (incidence): 5-HT(1B) (14/18), 5-HT(1D) (15/18), 5-HT(2A) (16/18), 5-HT(2B) (8/8), 5-HT(4(a)) (13/18), 5-HT(4(b)) (5/18), 5-HT(4(g)) (7/18), 5-HT(4(i)) (1/18), 5-HT(7(a/b)) (10/18) and 5-HT(7(d)) (12/18). 5-HT contracted and relaxed arterial rings at low (-logEC(50) M=7.0) and high (-logEC(50) M=4.2) concentrations, respectively. 5-HT-evoked contractions were antagonized partially by both 5-HT(1B)-selective SB224289 (200 nM) and 5-HT(2A)-selective ketanserin (1 microM) but not by 5-HT(1D)-selective BRL15572 (500 nM) or prazosin (1 microM). Sumatriptan caused contractions (-logEC(50) M=6.8, intrinsic activity with respect to 5-HT=0.3). Sumatriptan-evoked contractions were antagonized by SB224289 with high potency (pK(B)=9.4) but not by BRL15572. 5-HT-induced relaxations were resistant to blockade by 5-HT(1B)-selective SB224289 (1 microM), 5-HT(1D)-selective BRL15572, 5-HT(2B)-selective SB204741 (1 microM), 5-HT(4)-selective GR113808 (100 nM) and 5-HT(7)-selective SB269970 (1 microM), and a combination of SB204741 and SB269970, inconsistent with an involvement of 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1D), 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(7) receptors. Triton X-100 treatment of the arteries abolished acetylcholine-induced relaxations of rings precontracted by prostaglandin F(2alpha), but a reduction of the relaxant effects of 5-HT did not reach significance. Nitro-L-arginine (1 mM) reduced 5-HT-induced relaxations, suggesting a contribution of nitric oxide released from endothelial cells. Ketanserin (1 microM) prevented the relaxant effects of 5-HT. We conclude that 5-HT contracts human occipital artery through 5-HT(1B) receptors at low concentrations and through 5-HT(2A) receptors at high concentrations. Sumatriptan contracts mostly through 5-HT(1B) receptors. These results are consistent with the 5-HT(1B) and 5-HT(2A) mRNA data. 5-HT-induced relaxation is mediated, in part, through ketanserin-sensitive receptors, but 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1D), 5-HT(2B), 5-HT(4) and 5-HT(7) receptors appear not to be involved.
