Licata, F., et al. (1993). "Excitatory and inhibitory effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine on the firing rate of medial vestibular nucleus neurons in the rat." Neurosci Lett 154(1-2): 195-198.

	The effects of microiontophoretic application of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the neuronal firing rate of the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN) were studied in anaesthetized rats. Ninety-three % of the units modified their background activity following 5-HT iontophoresis, enhancements of the firing rate being recorded in 42%, decreases in 38% and biphasic effects in 13%. 5-HT antagonists methysergide and ketanserin blocked the excitatory but not the inhibitory responses to 5-HT. These latter were, however, mimicked by 5-HT agonists 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5MeODMT) and 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). It is concluded that 5-HT can variously influence the background activity of MVN neurons and that 5-HT2 and probably 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the responses.
