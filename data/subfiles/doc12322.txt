Zhang, Y. Q., et al. (2001). "Expression of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA in rat spinal dorsal horn and some nuclei of brainstem after peripheral inflammation." Brain Res 900(1): 146-151.

	The expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was studied in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn, nucleus of raphe magnus (NRM), ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) following carrageenan inflammation using in situ hybridization technique. The findings of this study demonstrated that 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was expressed with low to moderate levels in lumbar spinal dorsal horn, NRM, vlPAG and DRN. Following carrageenan inflammation, the expression of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA in ipsilateral dorsal horn, bilateral NRM, vlPAG and DRN was significantly increased. The peak occurred at 3 h and then there was a clear decrease but still a substantial number of labeled cells at 24 h after injection of carrageenan. This result suggested that the synthesis of 5-HT2A receptor is enhanced in spinal dorsal horn, NRM, vlPAG and DRN during inflammatory pain.
