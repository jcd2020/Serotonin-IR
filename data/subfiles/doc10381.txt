Slaughter, J. L., et al. (1990). "6-substituted tricyclic partial ergoline compounds are selective and potent 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor agents." Life Sci 47(15): 1331-1337.

	A series of 6 tricyclic partial ergoline derivatives was analyzed using radioligand binding assays. Four agents (LY 178210, LY 254089, LY 197205, and LY 197206) display high affinity (Ki less than or equal to 1.3 nM) for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor binding sites labeled by [3H]8-hydroxy- 2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and display greater than or equal to 150 fold selectivity for the 5-HT1A over the 5-HT1D receptor binding site. The most potent agent investigated, LY 178210, is essentially inactive (Ki greater than 1500 nM) at a total of 12 other neurotransmitter receptor binding sites in the brain. Using a forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase assay as a model of 5-HT1A receptor function, LY 178210 was found to display partial agonist activity which was blocked by 10(-5) M (-)pindolol. These data indicate that LY 178210 is a potent and selective 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist.
