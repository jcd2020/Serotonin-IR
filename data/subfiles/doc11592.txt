Wadenberg, M. L. and S. Ahlenius (1995). "Antagonism by the 5-HT2A/C receptor agonist DOI of raclopride-induced catalepsy in the rat." European Journal of Pharmacology 294(1): 247-251.

	It has been shown that the administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonists will antagonize the catalepsy induced by dopamine D-1 or D-2 receptor blocking agents. In the present study, administration of the 5-HT2A/C receptor agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodo)-2-aminopropane (DOI) (1 mg kg(-1) s.c.), counteracted the catalepsy produced by the dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist, raclopride (16 mgr kg(-1) s.c.), but not by the dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist, (R)-(+)-8-chloro-2,3,4,5-tetra-hydro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1H- 3-benzaze (SCH 23390) (0.2 mg kg(-1) s.c.). The effects of DOI on raclopride-induced catalepsy were fully antagonized by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A/C receptor antagonist, ritanserin (2 mg kg(-1) s.c.). The 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (6.25-25.0 mg kg(-1) i.p.), in combination with the peripheral 5-HTP decarboxylase inhibitor, benserazide (25 mg kg(-1) i.p.), and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, zimeldine (10 mg kg(-1) s.c.), enhanced the catalepsy produced by a low dose of raclopride (4 mg kg(-1) s.c.). It is concluded that stimulation of (postsynaptic) 5-HT2 receptors results in antagonism of the catalepsy induced by treatment with a dopamine D-2, but not a D-1, receptor antagonist. The fact that 5-HTP, in the presence of benserazide and zimeldine, enhanced raclopride-induced catalepsy suggests the possibility of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors acting in opposition to the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors, as regards extrapyramidal motor functions in the rat.
