	Objective Central 5-HT1A receptor is involved in the modulation of sensorimotor gating function. However, its precise role is not clearly defined in developmentally social deprived (isolation rearing, IR) rats featured with impaired sensorimotor gating ability. We therefore aimed to examine the effects of 5HT1A activation on acoustic startle response (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI) in IR rats in a condition of compromised presynaptic 5-HT functions. Methods Social control (SOC) and IR rats received an intracerebraoventricular (ICV) injection of 5-HT depletor, 5,7-DHT. Seven days later rats entered a protocol of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A agonist, in which locomotor activity, ASR and PPI and their tissue levels of 5-HT were measured. Results Our results found that both IR and 5,7-DHT decreased the tissue concentration of 5-HT. IR-induced hyperactivity and gating impairment were unaffected by 5-HT depletion. 8-OH-DPAT strengthened the ASR in IR but not SOC rats and the drug-reduced PPI could be adjusted by 5,7-DHT pretreatment. 8-OH-DPAT at 100 mu g/kg enhanced PPI in 5-HT-depleted SOC rats. However for IR rats, 8-OH-DPAT strengthened PPI in sham rats but downgraded it in depletion condition. Conclusion The integrity of central 5-HT system is important to 5-HT1A-modulated sensorimotor gating in isolation-reared rats.
