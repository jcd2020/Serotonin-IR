Maxishima, M., et al. (2001). "Serotonin 2A receptor-like immunoreactivity is detected in astrocytes but not in oligodendrocytes of rat spinal cord." Brain Res 889(1-2): 270-273.

	The distribution of the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor in glial cells in the white matter of rat spinal cord was immunohistochemically examined with specific antibodies against the 5-HT2A receptor. 5-HT2A receptor-like immunoreactivity was detected in astrocytes that were identified by an antibody against the glial fibrillary acidic protein. In contrast, 5-HT2A receptor-like immunoreactivity was not observed in oligodendrocytes.
