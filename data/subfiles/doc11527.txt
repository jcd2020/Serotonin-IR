Sebban, C., et al. (2002). "Effects of phencyclidine (PCP) and MK 801 on the EEGq in the prefrontal cortex of conscious rats; antagonism by clozapine, and antagonists of AMPA-, alpha(1)- and 5-HT(2A)-receptors." Br J Pharmacol 135(1): 65-78.

	1. The electroencephalographic (EEG) effects of the propsychotic agent phencyclidine (PCP), were studied in conscious rats using power spectra (0 - 30 Hz), from the prefrontal cortex or sensorimotor cortex. PCP (0.1 - 3 mg kg(-1) s.c.) caused a marked dose-dependent increase in EEG power in the frontal cortex at 1 - 3 Hz with decreases in power at higher frequencies (9 - 30 Hz). At high doses (3 mg kg(-1) s.c.) the entire spectrum shifted to more positive values, indicating an increase in cortical synchronization. MK 801 (0.05 - 0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.) caused similar effects but with lesser changes in power. 2. In contrast, the non-competitive AMPA antagonists GYKI 52466 and GYKI 53655 increased EEG power over the whole power spectrum (1 - 10 mg kg(-1) i.p.). The atypical antipsychotic clozapine (0.2 mg kg(-1) s.c.) synchronized the EEG (peak 8 Hz). The 5-HT(2A)-antagonist, M100907, specifically increased EEG power at 2 - 3 Hz at low doses (10 and 50 microg kg(-1) s.c.), whereas at higher doses (0.1 mg kg(-1) s.c.) the profile resembled that of clozapine. 3. Clozapine (0.2 mg kg(-1) s.c. ), GYKI 53655 (5 mg kg(-1) i.p.), prazosin (0.05 and 0.1 mg kg(-1) i.p.), and M100907 (0.01 and 0.05 mg kg(-1) s.c.) antagonized the decrease in power between 5 and 30 Hz caused by PCP (1 mg kg(-1) s.c.), but not the increase in power at 1 - 3 Hz in prefrontal cortex.
