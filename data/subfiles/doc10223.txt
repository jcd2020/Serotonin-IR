Pitsikas, N. and N. Sakellaridis (2005). "The 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RO 60-0491 counteracts rats' retention deficits in a recognition memory task." Brain Res 1054(2): 200-202.

	The effects of the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RO 60-0491 on recognition memory were investigated in the rat by using the object recognition task. Post-training administration of RO 60-0491 at 3 mg/kg, but not at 1 mg/kg, counteracted rats' performance deficits in the object recognition task, suggesting that this 5-HT2C receptor antagonist compound modulates storage and/or retrieval of information.
