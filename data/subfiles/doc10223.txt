Shibata, S., et al. (1992). "Ischemia-induced impairment of 2-deoxyglucose uptake and CA1 field potentials in rat hippocampal slices: protection by 5-HT1A receptor agonists and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists." Eur J Pharmacol 229(1): 21-29.

	Various in vitro models have been developed to study ischemia and/or hypoxia. In the present experiment, we examined whether hypoxia/hypoglycemia (ischemia) in rat hippocampal slices reduced the 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake and CA1 field potentials evoked by stimulation of Schaffer collaterals. Autoradiograms revealed that ischemia for 15 or 20 min reduced 2-DG uptake in the stratum radiatum of the CA1 and the dentate gyrus. Similarly, the CA1 field potentials of slices exposed to ischemia for 15 and 20 min decreased by about 70 and 90% after a 6-h washout. In the second experiment, we evaluated the neuroprotective effect of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone, and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists cyproheptadine, mianserin and ketanserin on deficits of 2-DG uptake and Schaffer-CA1 field potentials induced by ischemia. The 5-HT1A receptor agonists and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists exhibited significant neuroprotective actions against ischemia-induced deficits. Therefore, impairments of 2-DG uptake and CA1 field potentials induced by ischemia may be good markers of ischemia-induced functional deficits. The attenuating action of 5-HT1A receptor agonists and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists were assessed using this model of ischemia.
