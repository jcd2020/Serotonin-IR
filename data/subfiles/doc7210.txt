	Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) is a condition for which a safe, tolerated, and effective therapy is lacking. Treatment with typical or atypical antipsychotics may be contraindicated in patients with PDP because of the potential for aggravating motor symptoms. This study used a novel animal model with features of both Parkinson's disease (PD) and psychosis to examine a potential mechanism for reversing PDP. Animals with bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra displayed motoric impairments characteristic of humans with PD. In addition, they displayed augmented head twitches, augmented amphetamine-induced locomotor activity, and disrupted prepulse inhibition compared with sham controls, behavioral indices frequently used to assess antipsychotic activity in animal models. Pimavanserin, a selective 5-HT2A antagonist/inverse agonist, reversed the psychotic-like behavioral deficits, suggesting that nigrostriatal (6-hydroxydopamine) lesions induced alterations in 5-HT2A-mediated signaling. The selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist M100907, but not the selective 5-HT2C inverse agonist SB 252084 paralleled the effects of pimavanserin. Of note, the reversal of psychotic-like behaviors produced by 5-HT2A inverse agonists occurred without disrupting motor behaviors in lesioned subjects, suggesting that 5HT2A antagonism/inverse agonism may be beneficial in the treatment of PDP.
