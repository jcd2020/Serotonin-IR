Scott, C., et al. (2006). "SB-616234-A (1- 6-(cis-3,5-dimethylpiperazin-1-yl)-2,3-dihydro-5 methoxyindol-1-yl -1- 2 ' methyl-4 '-(5-methyl-1,2,3-oxadiazol-3-yl) biphenyl-4-yl methanone hydrochloride): A novel, potent and selective 5-HT1B receptor antagonist." Neuropharmacology 50(8): 984-990.

	SB-616234-A possesses high affinity for human 5-HT1B receptors stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (pK(i) 8.3 +/- 0.2), and is over 100-fold selective for a range of molecular targets except h5-HT1D receptors (pK(i) 6.6 +/- 0.1). Similarly, affinity (pK(i)) for rat and guinea pig striatal 5-HT1B receptors is 9.2 +/- 0.1. In [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding studies in the human recombinant cell line, SB-616234-A acted as a high affinity antagonist with a pA(2) value of 8.6 +/- 10.2 whilst providing no evidence of agonist activity in this system. In [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding studies in rat striatal membranes, SB-616234-A acted as a high affinity antagonist with an apparent pK(B) of 8.4 +/- 0.5, again whilst providing no evidence of agonist activity in this system. SB-616234-A (1 mu M) potentiated electrically stimulated [H-3]-5-HT release from guinea pig and rat cortical slices (S-2/S-1 ratios of 1.8 and 1.6, respectively). SB-616234-A (0.3-30 mg kg(-1) p.o.) caused a dose-dependent inhibition of ex vivo [H-3]-GR125743 binding to rat striatal 5-HTIB receptors with an ED50 of 2.83 +/- 0.39 mg kg(-1) p.o. Taken together these data suggest that SB-616234-A is apotent and selective 5-HT1B autoreceptor antagonist that occupies central 5-HT1B receptors invivofollowing oral administration.
