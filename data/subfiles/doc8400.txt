	In hippocampal membranes, the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and N,N-dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine (N,N-DP-5-CT) stimulated guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTP gamma S) binding by 130 to 140%; binding stimulated by nonselective agonists (5-HT and 5-CT) was similar to 30% greater. However, the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY100,635) completely abolished the increases produced by 8-OH-DPAT and N,N-DP-5-CT but only eliminated 70% of that elicited by 5-CT. The rank potency order of the tested agonists was identical with their rank order of affinity for 5-HT1A receptors [5-CT congruent to N,N-DP-5-CT > R-(+)-8-OH-DPAT > 5-HT > ipsapirone]. Racemic 8-OH-DPAT and the partial agonist ipsapirone exhibited lower intrinsic activity than R-(+)-8-OH-DPAT. R-(+)-8-OH-DPAT also stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding in cortex, but not in striatum, which lacks 5-HT1A receptors. Partial irreversible inactivation of 5-HT1A receptors, in vitro with phenoxybenzamine (0.3 or 1 mu M) or in vivo with N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (1 mg/kg), reduced the maximal response produced by R-(+)-8-OH-DPAT but did not alter its EC50. In autoradiographic sections, R-(+)-8-OH-DPAT stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding in 5-HT1A receptor-rich regions (dorsal hippocampus, 123%; lateral septum, 111%; midhippocampus, 110%; dorsal raphe nucleus, 83%; medial prefrontal cortex, similar to 60%). The EC50 of R-(+)-8-OH-DPAT did not vary significantly among brain regions (46-96 nM). Partial irreversible blockade of 5-HT1A receptors in brain sections (phenoxybenzamine, 10 mu M) reduced the maximal response without altering the EC50 in both the hippocampus and dorsal raphe. Despite prior evidence that dorsal raphe somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors exhibit high receptor/effector coupling efficiency (receptor reserve) compared with postsynaptic receptors in hippocampus, there was no evidence of a difference at the level of receptor/G protein coupling.
