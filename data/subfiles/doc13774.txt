	Significant involvement of oxidative stress in the brain can develop Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, a great number of clinical trials explains the limited success of antioxidant therapy in dealing with this neurodegenerative disease. Here, we established a lipopolymer system of poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nano particles (NPs) incorporated with phosphatidic acid (PA) and modified with sialic acid (SA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine-moduline (5HTM) to improve quercetin (QU) activity against oxidative stress induced by amyloid-beta (A beta) deposits. Morphological studies revealed a uniform exterior of QU-SA-5HTM-PA-PLGA NPs with a spherical structure and enhanced aggregation with inclusion of PA in the formulation. A better brain-targeted delivery of the lipopolymeric NPs was verified from the high blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of QU through strong interactions of surface SA and 5HTM with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine and 5-HT1B receptors, respectively. Immunofluorescence staining images also supported QU-SA-5HTM-PA-PLGA NPs to traverse the microvessels of AD rat brain. Western blot analysis showed that QU-loaded PA-PLGA NPs suppressed caspase-3 expression. The ability of the nanocarriers to recognize A beta fibrils was demonstrated from the reduced senile plaque formation and the attenuated acetylcholinesterase and malondialdehyde activity in the hippocampus. Hence, the medication of QU-SA-5HTM-PA-PLGA NPs can facilitate the BBB penetration and prevent A beta accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and neuronal apoptosis for the AD management.
