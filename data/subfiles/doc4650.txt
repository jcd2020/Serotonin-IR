Hirano, H., et al. (1995). "SEROTONERGIC REGULATION OF ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE IN RAT FRONTAL-CORTEX." Journal of Neurochemistry 65(3): 1139-1145.

	The extent to which serotonin regulates the activity of cortically projecting cholinergic neurons was studied using in vivo microdialysis to monitor interstitial concentrations of acetylcholine in the frontal cortex of freely moving rats. Systemic administration of the serotonin release-inducing agent fenfluramine (3 or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased acetylcholine release by 110-130%. The fenfluramine-induced increase in acetylcholine release was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with the selective serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), Pretreatment with the selective dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist SCH-23390 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) failed to prevent the fenfluramine-induced increase in acetylcholine release. In contrast, the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (5 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked fenfluramine-induced increases in acetylcholine release. In contrast to previous studies that have concluded that serotonin has inhibitory actions on cortical acetylcholine release, the present results indicate that fenfluramine increases cortical acetylcholine release in vivo by its ability to enhance serotonin transmission and that serotonin produces these effects at least in part via actions at serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.
