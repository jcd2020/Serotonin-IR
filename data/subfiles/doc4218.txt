Haleem, D. J. (1992). "Repeated corticosterone treatment attenuates behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin in rats." Life Sci 51(23): Pl225-230.

	The effects of 5 day corticosterone treatment (50 mg/kg s.c.; 2 x daily) are investigated on the behavioural and neuroendocrine responses to a 5-HT-1A selective agonist, 8-hydroxy -2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) in rats. Daily corticosterone treatment decreased body weight and food intake. After 5 day treatment a drug challenge of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT given on the sixth day produced smaller forepaw treading but comparable head waeving, flat body posture and also hypothermia in 5 day corticosterone than 5 day saline injected rats. Hyperphagic effects of only 0.25 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT were attenuated in 5 day corticosterone injected animals. The effects of 8-OH-DPAT on the increases of plasma corticosterone were markedly attenuated in the 5 day corticosterone injected animals. The findings may help towards an understanding of steroid-induced affective changes and psychosis.
