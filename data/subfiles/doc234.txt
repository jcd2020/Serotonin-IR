Alves, S. H., et al. (2004). "Anxiogenic effects in the rat elevated plus-maze of 5-HT(2C) agonists into ventral but not dorsal hippocampus." Behav Pharmacol 15(1): 37-43.

	The effect of the non-selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine (TFMPP, 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 microg) and the preferential 5-HT2C agonist 6-chloro-2(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine (MK-212, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 microg) microinjected into the ventral or dorsal hippocampus was investigated in anxiety measures of rats exposed to the elevated plus-maze test. Ventral hippocampal (VH) microinjections of the 0.75 or 1.5 microg doses of TFMPP reduced open-arm exploration without affecting the number of closed-arm entries, indicating a selective anxiogenic profile. The highest dose (3.0 microg) reduced open- and closed-arm entries, suggesting interference in locomotor activity. The 0.1 microg dose of MK-212 also caused a selective anxiogenic effect when microinjected into the ventral hippocampus, without disturbing locomotor activity. Microinjections of the two higher doses of MK-212 (0.3 or 1.0 microg) into the ventral hippocampus led to a decrease of exploration in both arms of the maze. In contrast to the anxiogenic effect observed in the VH, neither TFMPP nor MK-212 significantly changed anxiety measures when microinjected into the dorsal hippocampus. These results suggest that activation of 5-HT2C postsynaptic receptors located in the ventral, but not in the dorsal, hippocampus play an important role in anxiety triggered by the elevated plus-maze test.
