Hogberg, T., et al. (1992). "SYNTHESIS AND BINDING-PROPERTIES OF THE NEW FLUORINATED BENZAMIDE NCQ-616 - A POTENTIAL SELECTIVE DOPAMINE-D2 LIGAND FOR PET." Acta Pharmaceutica Nordica 4(4): 297-300.

	The substituted benzamide derivative NCQ 616 ((S)-N-[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]-5-bromo-2-(2-fluoroethoxy)-3-methoxybenzamide was prepared by alkylation of the corresponding 3-methoxysalicylamide. The affinity for the dopamine D2receptors was determined by inhibition of [H-3]raclopride-binding in rat striatal membranes. The K(i) value of this 2-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzamide analog was 123 pM, i.e. only seven times less potent than the highly active parent 5-bromo-2,3-dimethoxybenzamide FLB 457 (K(i) 18 pM). The affinity of NCQ 616 for other receptors (D1, 5HT1A, 5HT2, alpha1, muscarin) investigated was at least four orders of magnitude lower. Thus, the new fluoro-containing benzamide NCQ 616 is a potent and highly selective deopamine D2 antagonist, that is likely to be a suitable F-18-radio-labelled ligand for PET studies.
