Ngampramuan, S., et al. (2008). "Activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors attenuates tachycardia induced by restraint stress in rats." American Journal of Physiology-Regulatory Integrative and Comparative Physiology 294(1): R132-R141.

	To better understand the central mechanisms that mediate increases in heart rate (HR) during psychological stress, we examined the effects of systemic and intramedullary (raphe region) administration of the serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetraline (8-OH-DPAT) on cardiac changes elicited by restraint in hooded Wistar rats with preimplanted ECG telemetric transmitters. 8-OH-DPAT reduced basal HR from 356 +/- 12 to 284 +/- 12 beats/min, predominantly via a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic mechanism. Restraint stress caused tachycardia (an initial transient increase from 318 +/- 3 to 492 +/- 21 beats/min with a sustained component of 379 +/- 12 beats/min). beta-Adrenoreceptor blockade with atenolol suppressed the sustained component, whereas muscarinic blockade with methylscopolamine (50 mu g/kg) abolished the initial transient increase, indicating that sympathetic activation and vagal withdrawal were responsible for the tachycardia. Systemic administration of 8-OH-DPAT (10, 30, and 100 mu g/kg) attenuated stress-induced tachycardia in a dose-dependent manner, and this effect was suppressed by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (100 mu g/kg). Given alone, the antagonist had no effect. Systemically injected 8-OH-DPAT (100 mu g/kg) attenuated the sympathetically mediated sustained component (from + 85 +/- 19 to +/- 32 +/- 9 beats/min) and the vagally mediated transient (from + 62 +/- 5 to + 25 +/- 3 beats/min). Activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the medullary raphe by microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT mimicked the antitachycardic effect of the systemically administered drug but did not affect basal HR. We conclude that tachycardia induced by restraint stress is due to a sustained increase in cardiac sympathetic activity associated with a transient vagal withdrawal. Activation of central 5-HT(1A) receptors attenuates this tachycardia by suppressing autonomic effects. At least some of the relevant receptors are located in the medullary rapheparapyramidal area.
