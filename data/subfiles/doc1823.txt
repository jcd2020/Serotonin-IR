	The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of the 5-HT1A receptors in the lateral septum in the mediation of the anxiogenic effects of nicotine in the social interaction and elevated plus maze tests of anxiety in the rat. Bilateral infusion of (-)-nicotine (4 and 8 microg) and of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (200 and 500 ng) into the lateral septum decreased the time spent in social interaction, indicating anxiogenic effects. The anxiogenic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (500 ng) was completely reversed by coadministration of a behaviourally inactive dose of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (200 ng). The anxiogenic effect of the lower dose of (-)-nicotine (4 microg) was completely reversed by WAY 100635 (200 ng), but the reversal was only partial following administration of 8 microg nicotine. In a second test of anxiety, the elevated plus maze, lateral septal administration of 8-OH-DPAT (500 ng) and nicotine (4 microg) induced anxiogenic effects. In this test, the anxiogenic effect of nicotine (4 microg) was completely reversed by coadministration of WAY 100635 (200 ng). The effects of 8-OH-DPAT demonstrate that stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors in the lateral septum has anxiogenic effects in two animal tests and that the anxiogenic effects of nicotine are mediated at least in part by these 5-HT1A receptors.
