	The endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment protein-53 (ERGIC-53, aka LMAN1), which cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, is a known cargo receptor for a number of soluble proteins. However, whether LMAN1 plays a role as a trafficking factor in the central nervous system is largely unknown. Here, we determined the role of LMAN1 on endogenous protein levels of the Cys-loop superfamily of neuroreceptors, including gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) type 3 (5-HT3) receptors, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Knockdown of LMAN1 reduces the surface trafficking of endogenous beta 3 subunits of GABA(A)Rs in mouse hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of brain homogenates from LMAN1 knockout mice demonstrated that loss of LMAN1 decreases the total protein levels of 5HT(3)A receptors and gamma 2 subunits of GABA(A)Rs. LMAN1 knockout regulates the ER proteostasis network by upregulating ERP44 without changing calnexin levels. Interestingly, despite the critical role of the glycan-binding function of LMAN1 in its other known cargo clients, LMAN1 interacts with GABA(A)Rs in a glycan-independent manner. In summary, LMAN1 is a trafficking factor for certain neuroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is the first report of LMAN1 function in membrane protein trafficking. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.
