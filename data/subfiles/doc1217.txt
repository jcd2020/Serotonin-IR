Bobula, B., et al. (2001). "Different receptor subtypes are involved in the serotonin-induced modulation of epileptiform activity in rat frontal cortex in vitro." J Physiol Pharmacol 52(2): 265-274.

	The frontal cortex is innervated by serotonergic terminals from the raphe nuclei and it expresses diverse 5-HT receptor subtypes. We investigated the effects of 5-HT and different 5-HT receptor subtype-selective agonists on spontaneous discharges which had developed in rat cortical slices perfused with a Mg2+-free medium and the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin. The frequency of synchronous discharges, recorded extracellularly in superficial layers (II/III) of the frontal cortex, was dose-dependently enhanced by 5-HT (2.5-40 microM). That excitatory effect was blocked by the 5-HT2 receptor selective antagonist ketanserin. The 5-HT2A/2C receptor-selective agonist DOI and the 5-HT4 receptor agonist zacopride also increased the frequency of spontaneous discharges. In the presence of ketanserin, 5-HT decreased the discharge rate; a similar effect was observed when the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT or the 5-HT1B receptor agonist CGS-12066B was applied. The 5-HT3 receptor agonist m-CPBG was ineffective. In conclusion, 5-HT produces multiple effects on epileptiform activity in the frontal cortex via activation of various 5-HT receptor subtypes. The excitatory action of 5-HT, which predominates, is mediated mainly by 5-HT2 receptors. The inhibitory effects can be attributed to activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.
