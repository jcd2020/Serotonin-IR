Lima, L., et al. (1994). "8- H-3 HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO) TETRALIN BINDING-SITES IN GOLDFISH RETINA." Neurochemical Research 19(3): 249-255.

	The binding sites of 8-[H-3]hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]DPAT) were characterized in the retina of goldfish in order to evaluate the selectivity of the ligand for serotonin(1A) (5HT(1A)) receptors. Specificity of the binding was performed in the presence of serotonergic and dopaminergic agonists and antagonists. Buspirone, spiroxatrine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine were potent inhibitors, followed by propranolol, citalopram, imipramine and desipramine. Serotonin was not a potent inhibitor, and its interaction with the binding sites of [H-3]DPAT was complex. Nomifensine displayed an important inhibition, however, other dopamine uptake blockers, such as bupropion and GBR-12909, were less potent. Haloperidol was also a good inhibitor, but the D-1 receptor agonist, SKF-38393, the D-2 receptor antagonist, sulpiride, and dopamine did not inhibit the binding. GppNHp inhibited the binding in the micromolar range. The analysis of saturation experiments by isotopic dilution, using buspirone to determine nonspecific binding, revealed two sites. The number of binding sites defined by buspirone were higher than the ones defined by nomifensine. The specific binding, using buspirone for definition, was reduced by the intraocular injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. This investigation demonstrates that [H-3]DPAT labels 5HT(1A) receptors in goldfish retina, but also interacts with a non-5HT receptor site. These receptors seem to be localized in dopaminergic neurons.
