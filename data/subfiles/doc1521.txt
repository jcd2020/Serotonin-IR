	One brain region that has been implicated in the regulation of lordosis is the medial preoptic-anterior hypothalamic continuum (MPOA-AH). Previous studies have suggested that this zone may be part of the circuit mediating the effects of serotonin (5-HT) on sexual receptivity. In the present experiments, we investigated the role of 5-HT1a/7 and 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in the MPOA-AH in the control of lordosis. In two experiments, either 5-HT1a/7 or 5-HT2 agonists were injected unilaterally into the MPOA-AH of ovariectomized, hormonally primed female hamsters. In the first experiment, microinjections of the 5-HT1a/7 agonist 8-hydroxy-2,9-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin resulted in an attenuation of the lordosis posture by causing a decrease in the mean lordosis duration and an increase in the number of lordosis episodes over the entire testing period. In the second experiment, microinjections of the 5-HT2b/2c agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine did not result in any changes in sexual receptivity. However, microinjections of the 5-HT2 agonist (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl facilitated lordosis by increasing the mean lordosis duration and decreasing the number of lordosis episodes in the first 5 min of the testing period. These data indicate that serotonin may act in the MPOA-AH via 5-HT1a/7 receptors to attenuate and 5-HT2 receptors to facilitate sexual receptivity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).
