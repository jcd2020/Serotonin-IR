	Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is an important hypothalamic regulator of feeding behavior. In this study we have investigated the regulation of the expression of preproNPY mRNA in male obese and lean Zucker rats by in situ hybridization. These animals represent a model of genetic obesity with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and altered endocrine functions. Obese Zucker rats, treated for 12 days with 0.9% saline, had about 210% higher level of basal preproNPY mRNA expression in the arcuate nucleus when compared to their lean littermate controls. Repeated administrations of 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonergic 5-HT1A agonist, or mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, did not modify the basal expression of preproNPY mRNA in the Zucker phenotypes. The 8-OH-DPAT treatment significantly reduced hyperinsulinemia in obese Zucker rats without changing plasma glucose levels. The mifepristone treatment significantly increased plasma corticosterone levels in lean animals, but not in obese animals. The present study demonstrates enhanced expression of preproNPY mRNA in the arcuate nucleus in obese Zucker rats suggesting an involvement of NPY in the pathophysiology of the hyperphagic syndrome and genetically determined obesity in Zucker rats. Neither the antagonism of glucocorticoid receptors by mifepristone, nor repeated treatment with 8-OH-DPAT resulting in reduced insulin levels in obese Zucker rats, modified the basal expression of preproNPY mRNA in the arcuate nucleus.
