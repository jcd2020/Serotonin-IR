	Flibanserin acts at cortical, limbic, hypothalamic, and brainstem nuclei to inhibit serotonin release by binding to 5-HT1A autoreceptors and block postsynaptic action of serotonin at 5-HT2A receptors. This gradually disinhibits the turnover of other monoamines like dopamine and noradrenaline that are critical for sexual desire.
