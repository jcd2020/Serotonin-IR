	We have investigated the in vivo motor stimulating and gastroprokinetic properties of the azabicycloalkyl benzimidazolone derivative BIMU 1 (3-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-N-(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl)-2-oxo-1H- benzimidazole-1-carboxamide hydrochloride) and its binding profile at 5-hydroxytryptamine3 and 5-hydroxytryptamine4 receptors, in an attempt to assess the serotonergic mechanism underlying its prokinetic action. BIMU 1 dose-dependently (0.01-0.3 mg/kg i.v.) increased the motility of a denervated pouch of canine stomach. This excitatory action was sensitive to muscarinic blockade. A similar stimulatory effect was exerted by the benzamidic prokinetic agent cisapride (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.v.) but not by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (up to 1 mg/kg i.v.). The significance for propulsive efficacy of the motor stimulating activity of BIMU 1 was evaluated in a model of gastric emptying of liquids in the conscious dog. The emptying rate of a non-caloric liquid meal instilled through a gastric fistula was accelerated by both BIMU 1 (0.01-1 mg/kg i.v. and 0.1-3 mg/kg p.o.) and cisapride (0.03-1 mg/kg i.v. and 0.3-10 mg/kg p.o.). Ondansetron (1 mg/kg i.v.) did not show any effect. The activity of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist DAU 6285 was evaluated in the gastric emptying model per se and in interaction experiments on the accelerating action of BIMU 1 (0.3 mg/kg i.v.).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
