Inoue, T., et al. (2000). Serotonergic neurotransmission and defensive freezing in the conditioned fear stress paradigm. Amsterdam, Elsevier Science Bv.

	Several serotonin1A (5-HT1A) agonists and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been developed as new anxiolytics or antipanic agents. Until recently, no animal model has been available for screening the anxiolytic effect of SSRIs and studying its mechanism of action. The authors have investigated the relationship between 5-HT neurotransmission and anxiety using conditioned fear stress (CFS), an animal model of anxiety. CFS increased 5-HT neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, dependent on the intensity of CFS. Pharmacological studies showed that SSRIs, 5-HT1A agonists and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are assumed to facilitate 5-HT neurotransmission, decreased fear/anxiety in CFS. In vivo microdialysis studies displayed that increased prefrontal 5-HT metabolism by CFS reflected increased 5-HT release and this increased 5-HT neurotransmission was followed by a resolution of the freezing behaviour. These findings suggest that facilitation of brain 5-HT neurotransmission decreases anxiety in agreement with the clinical reports that SSRIs are effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Further CFS studies will contribute to our better understanding of the mechanism of anxiolytic action of serotonergic drugs and lead to the development of new treatment strategies for anxiety disorders.
