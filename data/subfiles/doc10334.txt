Prabhakaran, J., et al. (2006). "Synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of O-methyl-C-11 2-{4- 4-(3-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl -butyl}-4-methyl-2H- 1,2,4 -tria zine-3,5-dione: A novel agonist 5-HT1A receptor PET ligand." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 16(8): 2101-2104.

	Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of 2-{4-[4-(3-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (5 or MMT), a high affinity and selective serotonin 5-HT1AR agonist PET tracer, are described. GTP gamma S assay shows that MMT is an agonist with an EC50 comparable to 5-HT. Radiolabeling of 5 was achieved in 30% yield (EOS) from desmethyl-MMT (4) with >99% chemical and radiochemical purities and a specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol. PET Studies in baboon show that [C-11]5 penetrates the blood-brain barrier but, because of low specific binding and fast clearance of radioactivity it is not a suitable PET tracer for the in vivo quantification of 5-HT1AR.
