	The preBötzinger (preBötC) complex has been suggested as the primary site where systemically administered selective serotonin agonists have been shown to reduce or prevent opioid-induced depression of breathing. However, this hypothesis has not been tested pharmacologically in vivo. This study sought to determine whether 5-HT1A receptors within the preBötC and ventral respiratory column (VRC) mediate the tachypneic response induced by intravenous (IV) (±)-8-Hydroxy-2-diproplyaminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) in a decerebrated dog model. IV 8-OH-DPAT (19 ± 2 μg/kg) reduced both inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) durations by ∼ 40%, but had no effect on peak phrenic activity (PPA). Picoejection of 1, 10, and 100 μM 8-OH-DPAT on I and E preBötC neurons produced dose-dependent decreases up to ∼ 40% in peak discharge. Surprisingly, microinjections of 8-OH-DPAT and 5-HT within the VRC from the obex to 9 mm rostral had no effect on timing and PPA. These results suggest that the tachypneic effects of IV 8-OH-DPAT are due to receptors located outside of the areas we studied.
