Cockerham, L. G. and C. D. Forcino (1995). "EFFECT OF ANTIHISTAMINES, DISODIUM-CROMOGLYCATE (DSCG) OR METHYSERGIDE ON POSTIRRADIATION CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW AND MEAN SYSTEMIC ARTERIAL BLOOD-PRESSURE IN PRIMATES AFTER 25 GY, WHOLE-BODY, GAMMA-IRRADIATION." Journal of Radiation Research 36(2): 77-90.

	Exposure to ionizing radiation causes hypotension, cerebral ischemia and release of histamine (HA) and serotonin (5-HT). To investigate the relationship among these responses, rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) received physiological saline (i.v.), disodium cromoglycate (DSCG), antihistamines (AH, mepyramine and cimetidine), or methysergide (METH), then were given 25 Gy whole-body irradiation. Monkeys receiving DSCG, AH or METH had higher post-irradiation mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) than saline-treated controls. Compared to levels in controls, post-irradiation hippocampal blood flow (rCBF) levels were higher in monkeys receiving DSCG, AH or METH. Treatment with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist methysergide was the most effective in maintaining both rCBF and MBP after irradiation. Results support the hypothesis that the irradiation-induced cerebral ischemia and, to some extent, the hypotension is mediated by serotonin through 5-HT2 receptor sites.
