Zhang, J. H., et al. (1997). "(-)alprenolol potentiates the disrupting effects of dizocilpine on sensorimotor function in the rat." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 132(3): 281-288.

	The beta-adrenoceptor antagonist as well as serotonin 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, (-)alprenolol, was found to potentiate the disrupting effect of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, dizocilpine, on prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response (ASR) in the rat. The facilitating effect of dizocilpine on ASR amplitude was also potentiated by (-)alprenolol. (-)Alprenolol by itself did not affect either of these measures. These effects did not seem to be related to the unselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist property of (-)alprenolol, since combined pretreatment with the beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists, metoprolol and ICI 118551, did not alter the effects of dizocilpine on startle behaviour. However, a serotonergic influence was suggested by the fact that a facilitating effect of dizocilpine on ASR amplitude was also obtained by pretreatment with the 5-HT precursor, L-5-HTP, ill benserazide-pretreated rats. Furthermore, pretreatment with the 5-HT2 selective receptor antagonist, MDL 100907, significantly reduced the (-)alprenolol-induced potentiation of the effects of dizocilpine on startle behaviour, while the 5-HT3 selective receptor antagonist, ondansetron, failed to do that. Finally, the (-)alprenolol-induced potentiation of the effects of dizocilpine was significantly reduced by pretreatment with the atypical antipsychotic, clozapine, and by the potential antipsychotic and selective dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist, raclopride. This study suggests that altered 5-HT activity may influence the effects of psychotomimetic drugs such as dizocilpine on sensorimotor function, and this observation may have implications for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia in humans.
