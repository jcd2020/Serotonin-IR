Swedberg, M. D. B., et al. (1992). "D-16949 (ANPIRTOLINE) - A NOVEL SEROTONERGIC (5-HT(1B)) PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC AGENT ASSESSED BY ITS DISCRIMINATIVE EFFECTS IN THE RAT." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 263(3): 1015-1022.

	D-16949 [6-chlor-2-(piperidyl-4-thio)-pyridine; Anpirtoline] is a novel centrally acting compound with serotonergic effects. To assess its discriminative stimulus effects, rats were trained to discriminate D-16949 (2.0 mg/kg i.p., 30 min) from no drug. D-16949 induced dose-dependent discriminative stimulus effects (ED50, 0.31 mg/kg), and did not produce sedation. The opioid analgesics codeine, pentazocine and tramadol all failed to substitute for D-16949. The opioid antagonist naltrexone did not antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of D-16949. Phencyclidine, d-amphetamine, lysergic acid diethylamide and quipazine produced between 0 and 35% responding on the D-16949 lever. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin substituted partially (45%) for D-16949, whereas 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine and RU 24969 completely and dose-dependently substituted for D-16949. The discriminative stimulus effects of D-16949 were not reversed by either cyproheptadine, ketanserin, pirenperone, spiperone or methysergide. The 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) active antagonists ICS 205-930 and MDL 72222 were also ineffective as D-16949 antagonists. It is concluded that the discriminative stimulus effects of D-16949 are not mediated through opioid or 5-HT2 mechanisms. The present data also do not suggest the involvement of 5-HT3 mechanisms, but that D-16949 produces its discriminative stimulus effects in the rat primarily via agonistic actions at 5-HT1B receptors.
