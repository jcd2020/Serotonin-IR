Davidson, C. and J. A. Stamford (1995). "THE EFFECT OF PAROXETINE ON 5-HT EFFLUX IN THE RAT DORSAL RAPHE NUCLEUS IS POTENTIATED BY BOTH 5-HT1A AND 5-HT1B/D RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS." Neuroscience Letters 188(1): 41-44.

	Serotonin (5-HT) efflux in slices of rat dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) was evoked by pseudo one pulse electrical stimulation (20 pulses at 100 Hz, 190 ms train duration) and measured, along with 5-HT uptake, by fast cyclic voltammetry (FCV). The selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine (10(-7) M) increased 5-HT efflux to 147 +/- 6% of pre-drug Values at maximum (mean +/- SEM, n = 5) and the half-life of uptake to 443 +/- 38%. The non-selective 5-HT1 antagonist methiothepin (2 x 10(-7) M) increased 5-HT efflux to 147 +/- 9% at maximum but had no effect on uptake half-life. In contrast, (+)-WAY 100135 (10(6) M) and GR 127935 (5 x 10(-8) M), selective antagonists at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D receptors, respectively, affected neither 5-HT efflux nor uptake. When given in combination with paroxetine, the antagonists significantly increased the effect of paroxetine on efflux: methiothepin to 228 + 24% (P < 0.001), (+)-WAY 100135 to 212 + 31% (P < 0.05) and GR 127935 to 203 +/- 23% (P < 0.01). These data suggest that, under these experimental conditions, DRN 5-HT autoreceptors are tonically activated in the presence of the uptake blocker and that the antagonists act by blocking this counteracting autoinhibitory tone. The data also strongly indicate that 5-HT efflux in the rat DRN is under the control not only of 5-HT1A but also of 5-HT1B/D receptors.
