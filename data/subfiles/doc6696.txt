	Bayer is developing the aminomethylchroman derivative, repinotan, a 5-HT1A agonist, as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury [216172]. It has completed phase III trials in Canada and the US [342562], [344747]. In June 2001, NDA filing was expected by 2004 [411649]. As of March 2002, it was undergoing phase III trials for both indications, and Bayer expected to launch the product in 2006 in Europe and the US [443846]. Repinotan was being developed initially as an i.v. formulation for the treatment of ischemic stroke and brain injury and as an oral formulation for the treatment of depression; however, development has been discontinued for the latter indication [317452]. In March 2002, Lehman Brothers predicted a launch date of 2006, estimating peak sales of US $1000 million and a 20 to 30% probability of reaching market [450456], while in April 2002, Bank Vontobel also predicted a launch in 2006 with potential sales of Euro450 million in its fifth year of sales [450454]. Bayer predicts peak sales of Euro450 million [397137].
