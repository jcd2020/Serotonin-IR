Mansur, A., et al. (2018). "PET-MR Attenuation Correction in Dynamic Brain PET Using C-11 Cimbi-36: A Direct Comparison With PET-CT." Ieee Transactions on Radiation and Plasma Medical Sciences 2(5): 483-489.

	PET-MR is increasingly used in a range of clinical indications, though its use for quantitative brain PET research has not been widely reported. To isolate and evaluate MR-based attenuation correction (MR-AC) effects on fitted PET kinetic model parameters, we used a previously reported atlas-based method to synthesize CTs from structural MR scans, substituted for the CTs acquired in a dynamic PET-CT study where [C-11] Cimbi-36 was used to quantify 5-HT2A receptor binding in the brain. The resulting small differences (< 5%) in kinetic outcome measures using MR-AC compared to CT-AC were consistent with the observed differences between the MR-AC and CT attenuation maps and within the test-retest variability of the radioligand. This supports the use of MR-AC for quantitative PET imaging of the brain.
