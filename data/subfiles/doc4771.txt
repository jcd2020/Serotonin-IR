Hackl, L. P., et al. (2005). "Behavioral effects of 8-OH-DPAT injections into pontine and mesencephalic areas containing 5-HT-immunoreactive perikarya in the pigeon." Brain Res 1035(2): 154-167.

	This study examined the distribution of 5-HT-immunoreactive perikarya (5-HT-IRp) and the effects of local injections of 8-OH-DPAT into 5-HT-IRp-containing pontine and mesencephalic regions on feeding and drinking behaviors in free-feeding pigeons. When infused into the midline 5-HT-IRp-containing areas, 8-OH-DPAT (6.1 nmol) reliably elicited drinking and, to a lesser extent, feeding responses during the first hour after injection. These responses were significantly higher than the ingestive indexes observed (1) after vehicle (ascorbic acid 0.1%, 200 nl) injections at the same sites and (2) after 8-OH-DPAT injections into adjacent sites devoid of 5-HT-IRp. Increases in drinking were proportionally higher than those observed in feeding and a significant negative correlation was observed between water and food after midline 8-OH-DPAT injections. Similar dipsogenic responses were observed after injections of different 8-OH-DPAT doses (0.6, 2.0, and 6.1 nmol). Pretreatment with local injections of p-MPPI (an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors) attenuated the ingestive responses evoked by 8-OH-DPAT injections. Injections of 8-OH-DPAT into lateral 5-HT-IRp-containing sites evoked only inconsistent and weak ingestive responses. These results indicate that 5-HT1A receptor-mediated circuits located in the midline superior raphe system of the pigeon may play an important role in mechanisms controlling water intake, similar to that observed in mammals.
