Orjales, A., et al. (2002). "New 3-benzisothiazolyl and 3-benzisoxazolylpiperazine derivatives with atypical antipsychotic binding profile." Eur J Med Chem 37(9): 721-730.

	New 3-benzisothiazolyl and 3-benzisoxazolylpiperazine derivatives were synthesised and their 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and D-2 receptor binding affinities evaluated. The compounds displayed high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor combined with moderate to low 5-HT1A and D-2 affinities. Two of them, 18 and 25, have been selected for further pharmacological studies to be evaluated as potential atypical antipsychotics. (C) 2002 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.
