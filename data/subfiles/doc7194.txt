	Three decades on from Blundell's suggestion that serotonin serves to orchestrate endogenous satiety, we present an overview of the behavioral, pharmacological and neurological evidence that underpins our understanding of the role of serotonin in the control of appetite. Early human and rodent studies, many using fenfluramine, provided initial support for the hypothesis. The more recent characterization of serotonin receptor subtypes, the development of selective pharmacological probes, and the use of transgenic mice unable to express certain 5-HT receptor subtypes has identified specific roles for the 5-HT2C, 5-HT1B and 5-HT6 receptor subtypes in feeding behavior. It has also provided support for the development of 5-HT2C receptor agonists as a treatment for obesity. Serotonin acts at multiple brain sites to enhance satiety; these include the nucleus of the solitary tract and lateral parabrachial nucleus in the brainstem and hypothalamic sub-regions such as the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei. There are important interactions between serotonin- and hypothalamic peptide-containing cells, especially those expressing alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and Neuropeptide Y. Serotonin also has important interactions with cholecystokinin at the brainstem level. The multiplicity of these interactions has been reflected in the realization that serotonin has multiple influences at the behavioral level, which range from the mediation of short-term satiation in response to gastric distension and the presence of gut nutrients, to modulation of the responses evoked by conditioned cues that lead to the initiation of feeding.
