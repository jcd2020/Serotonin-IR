	J. Neurochem. (2012) 122, 4857. Abstract Mouse superficial superior colliculus (SuSC) contains dense GABAergic innervation and diverse nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to investigate the subunit compositions of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) expressed on mouse SuSC GABAergic terminals. [125I]-Epibatidine competition-binding studies revealed that the a3 beta 2* and a6 beta 2* nicotinic subtype-selective peptide a-conotoxin MII-blocked binding to 40 +/- 5% of SuSC nAChRs. Acetylcholine-evoked [3H]-GABA release from SuSC crude synaptosomal preparations is calcium dependent, blocked by the voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker, cadmium, and the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine, but is unaffected by muscarinic, glutamatergic, P2X and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Approximately 50% of nAChR-mediated SuSC [3H]-GABA release is inhibited by a-conotoxin MII. However, the highly a6 beta 2*-subtype-selective a-conotoxin PIA did not affect [3H]-GABA release. Nicotinic subunit-null mutant mouse experiments revealed that ACh-stimulated SuSC [3H]-GABA release is entirely beta 2 subunit-dependent. a4 subunit deletion decreased total function by >90%, and eliminated a-conotoxin MII-resistant release. ACh-stimulated SuSC [3H]-GABA release was unaffected by beta 3, a5 or a6 nicotinic subunit deletions. Together, these data suggest that a significant proportion of mouse SuSC nicotinic agonist-evoked GABA-release is mediated by a novel, a-conotoxin MII-sensitive a3a4 beta 2 nAChR. The remaining a-conotoxin MII-resistant, nAChR agonist-evoked SuSC GABA release appears to be mediated via a4 beta 2* subtype nAChRs.
