Pesce, G. and F. Hery (1996). "Resolution of multiple affinity states of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A receptors labelled by H-3 -8-hydroxy-2-(DI-n-propilamino) tetralin in rat hippocampal membranes." Gen Pharmacol 27(4): 723-729.

	1. We examined the binding of [H-3]-8-hydroxy-2-(DI-n-propilamino) tetralin ([H-3]-8OH-DPAT) to 5-hydroxytriptamine-1A (5-HT1A) receptors in rat hippocampal membranes. 2. Computer analysis of [H-3]-80H-DPAT displacement curves in the absence and in the presence of 100 mu M guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) were best fitted with a three-site model with apparent dissociation constants (K-d) of 0.45, 2,8 and 30 nM; the corresponding binding capacity (B-max) existing in the three affinity states were 4, 2 and 12 pmol/g of tissue (wet weight), respectively. 3. These results suggest that [H-3]-8OH-DPAT binding can be resolved as complex isotherms and we provided evidence that [H-3]-8OH-DPAT labels 2 high affinity GTP gamma S sensitive and one low-affinity GTP gamma S insensitive state of 5-HT1A receptors.
