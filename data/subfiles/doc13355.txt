Wang, Y., et al. (1997). "In vivo effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor activation on rat nucleus tractus solitarius neurones excited by vagal C-fibre afferents." Neuropharmacology 36(4-5): 489-498.

	The effects of ionophoretically applied 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-HT receptor agonists were studied on rat nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) neurones receiving unmyelinated vagal afferent input. 5-HT excited 15 of 34 neurones (44%), inhibited 10 (29%) and had no effect on nine. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin HBr (8-OH-DPAT) excited 23 of 53 neurones (43%), inhibited 24 (45%) and had no effect on six neurones and (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine HCl activated 18 of 37 neurones (49%), inhibited nine (24%) and had no effect on 10. These results demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors can excite or inhibit populations of NTS neurones. Phenylbiguanide, however, excited 20 of 23 neurones (87%), inhibited only one (4%) and had no effect on two indicating that 5-HT3 receptor activation has an excitatory action. NTS neurones receiving cardiac vagal afferent input were more likely to be excited by 5-HT (five of five, 100%) or 8-OH-DPAT (four of five. 80%) than the population as a whole. In conclusion, the data demonstrate that 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3 receptor subtypes are functionally present on NTS neurones receiving excitatory vagal afferent input. Further, the subpopulation of NTS neurones receiving input from cardiac afferents are excited by 5-HT, possibly by an action on 5-HT1A or 5-HT3 receptors.
