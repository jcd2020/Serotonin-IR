	1. The effects of tandospirone (TDS) on dissociated rat dorsal raphe neurones were investigated using the patch-clamp method. 2. Under current-clamp conditions, TDS hyperpolarized the cell membrane, resulting in the reduction of firing rates. 3. Under voltage-clamp conditions, TDS induced an inward rectifying K+ current in a concentration-dependent manner. 4. The TDS-induced K+ currents (I(TDS)) were mimicked by 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A agonist. The I(TDS) was blocked by spiperone, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, in a concentration-dependent manner. 5. N-Ethylmaleimide, an agent which uncouples between the receptor and the G-protein, irreversibly blocked the I(TDS). 6. In neurones perfused intracellularly with a pipette-solution containing GTP using the conventional whole-cell patch recording, the I(TDS) showed a gradual rundown. When the neurones were perfused with GTPgammaS, TDS activated the inwardly rectifying K+ current in an irreversible manner. 7. In the inside-out patch recording mode, TDS-activated single K+ channel currents (i(TDS)) which also showed an inward rectification. When the GDP in cytosolic side was completely replaced with GTP, the open probability of i(TDS) significantly increased. 8. These results indicate that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors by TDS directly opens the inward rectifying K+ channels via a G-protein mediated process.
