Sershen, H., et al. (1996). "Effect of ibogaine on cocaine-induced efflux of H-3 dopamine and H-3 serotonin from mouse striatum." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 53(4): 863-869.

	Ibogaine, an indole alkaloid with proposed antiaddictive properties, has structural similarity to serotonin and has been shown to have affinity to the kappa-opioid binding site. In addition to the dopamine system, the serotonin system is a major target for cocaine action and the opioid system can affect the serotonin system. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of ibogaine on cocaine-induced, electrically evoked efflux of [H-3]dopamine and [H-3]serotonin from striatal tissue incubated in vitro, and their modulation by the kappa-opioid system. Cocaine (10(-6) M) added in vitro increased the fractional efflux of both [H-3]dopamine (FRS(2)/FRS(1) = 2.42 +/- 0.36) and [H-3]serotonin (FRS(2)/FRS(1) = 1.31 +/- 0.06). Mice treated in vivo with ibogaine (40 mg/kg or 2 times 40 mg/kg, IP) and killed 2 or 18 h later still showed the cocaine-induced increase in [H-3]dopamine, but [H-3]serotonin efflux was not increased. The 5-HT1B agonist CGS-12066A (10(-6) M, added in vitro) increased [H-3]dopamine release, but did not alter cocaine-induced efflux of [H-3]dopamine. CGS-12066A did not affect [H-3]serotonin release, but the cocaine-induced increase in [H-3]serotonin was inhibited. CGS-12066A (1 mg/kg, SC) potentiated cocaine (25 mg/kg, SC)-induced locomotor activity. Ibogaine pretreatment reduced both the cocaine and the CGS-12066A cocaine-induced increase in locomotor activity. The kappa-opioid agonist U-62066 (10(-6) M, added in vitro) reduced both [H-3]dopamine and [H-3]serotonin release. This inhibitory effect was blocked by in vivo administration of ibogaine. U-62066 did not alter cocaine-induced [H-3]dopamine efflux, but reduced cocaine-induced [H-3]serotonin efflux. In striatal tissue from ibogaine-pretreated mice, U-62066 restored the cocaine-induced increase in [H-3]serotonin release. U-62066 (1 mg/kg, SC) potentiated cocaine-induced behavior and maintained an increased locomotor activity after ibogaine treatment. The results suggest that ibogaine may block the cocaine-mediated effects on serotonergic transmission, that subsequently modulate dopamine release. The kappa-opioid modulation of serotonergic transmission is also involved.
