	The effects of the 5-HT2C receptor inverse agonist deramciclane on the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) uptake and excitatory amino acid release processes were compared in rat cerebrocortical homogenates containing resealed plasmalemma fragments and nerve endings. Deramciclane non-competitively inhibited the uptake of [H-3]GABA with a K-i value of 13.7 +/- 0.5 mu M and partially displaced specifically bound [H-3]( R,S)-N-[4,4-bis(3-methyl-2-thienyl)-3-butenyl]nipecotic acid ([H-3]NNC-328) with high affinity (IC50 = 2.0 +/- 0.7 nM). Depolarization by 4-aminopyridine or by 4-aminopyridine with (S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate [(S)-AMPA] induced the release of [H-3]D-aspartate. Deramciclane (10 mu M) partially (similar to 50%) inhibited the release of [H-3]D-aspartate without affecting [H-3]D-aspartate uptake. These results suggest a role for presynaptic inhibition of excitatory amino acid release and GABA uptake in the anxiolytic properties of deramciclane. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
