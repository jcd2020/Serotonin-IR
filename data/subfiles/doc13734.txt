Yamato, H., et al. (2003). Fluoxetine reduces L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat striatum. Advances in Brain Research: Cerebrovascular Disorders and Neurodegeneration. K. Satoh, S. Suzuki and M. Matsunaga. Amsterdam, Elsevier Science Bv. 1251: 191-197.

	We investigated the effect of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-derived extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum of rats with nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation using in vivo microdialysis. Treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) induced a 41% reduction in the cumulative amount of extracellular DA during 300 min following L-DOPA administration (50 mg/kg i.p.). This effect was antagonized by pretreatment with WAY-100635, a potent 5-HT1A antagonist, indicating that this effect of fluoxetine is due to its 5-HT1A agonistic property. These results suggest that SSRIs may impair motor functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by reducing efflux of exogenous L-DOPA-derived DA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.
