Reddy, V. P. L. and H. N. Bhargava (1992). "ABSTINENCE FROM U-50,488H, A KAPPA-OPIATE RECEPTOR AGONIST, DECREASES THE BINDING OF H-3 DPAT TO 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS OF THE RAT." Neuropharmacology 31(12): 1243-1249.

	The effect of trans-(+/-)-3,4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-12-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzene-acetamide methane sulfonate (U-50,488H), a kappa-opiate agonist-induced tolerance and abstinence on 5-HT1A receptors was determined in regions of the brain and spinal cord of the rat. The administration of U-50,488H (25 mg/kg, i.p., twice daily) to male Sprague Dawley rats for 4 days resulted in the development of almost complete tolerance to its analgesic and hypothermic effects. On day 5, the animals were divided into tolerant and abstinent groups and sacrificed. The brain and spinal cord were excised from all groups of rats and the brain was dissected into 6 regions, namely, amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, midbrain, pons + medulla and cortex. The 5-HT1A receptors were characterized by using [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]DPAT) as the ligand. The binding constants (B(max) and K(d) values) of [H-3]DPAT in regions of the brain and spinal cord of rats tolerant to U-50,488H and vehicle did not differ. However, the B(max) value of [H-3]DPAT in the hypothalamus of U-50,488H-abstinent rats was decreased but the K(d) value did not change. In the other regions of the brain and spinal cord of U-50,488H-abstinent rats, the B(max) and K(d) values of [H-3]DPAT were unaffected. Subcutaneous administration of DPAT produced hypothermic response in vehicle- and U-50,488H-treated rats. The intensity of this effect was more marked in U-50,488H-abstinent group. It is concluded that 5-HT1A receptors are down-regulated in the hypothalamus of U-50,488H-abstinent rats but the hypothermic response to 5-HT1A agonist is intensified.
