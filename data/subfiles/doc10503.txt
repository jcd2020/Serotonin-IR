Querejeta, E., et al. (2005). "In vivo effects of local activation and blockade of 5-HT1B receptors on globus pallidus neuronal spiking." Brain Res 1043(1-2): 186-194.

	Several morphological works have shown that the globus pallidus (GP) contains the highest density of 5-HT1B receptors within the telencephalon. However, the role of these receptors in the spiking of GP neurons in vivo is unknown. In the present work, we use single-unit extracellular recordings in the anesthetized rat to analyze changes in the firing rate of GP neurons evoked by local activation and blockade of 5-HT1B receptors. Intrapallidal administration of serotonin, or the serotonin uptake inhibitor fluoxetine, predominantly produced an excitatory effect in the basal firing rate of GP neurons. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist, L-694,247, caused a dose-dependent excitatory effect on most pallidal neurons tested. Blockade of 5-HT1B receptors by intrapallidal application of methiothepin predominantly caused inhibition in GP neurons firing rate. Moreover, methiothepin diminished the excitatory effect evoked by L-694,247. Furthermore, local serotonin did not evoke significant changes in the basal firing rate of GP neurons in unilateral striatal lesioned rats. Taken all together, these results suggest that serotonin 5-HT1B receptors significantly contribute to the control of spiking of the rat GP neurons, and that the 5-HT1B receptors exerting this control are most likely localized in the striato-pallidal pathway.
