	Positron emission tomography (PET) enables non-invasive estimation of neurotransmitter fluctuations in the living human brain. While these methods have been applied to dopamine and some other transmitters, estimation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; Serotonin) release has proved to be challenging. Here we demonstrate the utility of the novel 5-HT2A receptor agonist radioligand, [C-11]CIMBI-36, and a d-amphetamine challenge to evaluate synaptic 5-HT changes in the living human brain. Seventeen healthy male volunteers received [C-11]CIMBI-36 PET scans before and 3 h after an oral dose of d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). Dynamic PET data were acquired over 90 min, and the total volume of distribution (V-T) in the frontal cortex and the cerebellum derived from a kinetic analysis using MA1. The frontal cortex binding potential (BPNDfrontal) was calculated as (V-T(frontal)/V-T(cerebellum)) - 1. increment BPNDfrontal = 1 - (BPNDfrontal post-dose/BPNDfrontal baseline) was used as an index of 5-HT release. Statistical inference was tested by means of a paired Students t-test evaluating a reduction in post-amphetamine [C-11]CIMBI-36 BPNDfrontal. Following d-amphetamine administration, [C-11]CIMBI-36 BPNDfrontal was reduced by 14 +/- 13% (p = 0.002). Similar effects were observed in other cortical regions examined in an exploratory analysis. [C-11]CIMBI-36 binding is sensitive to synaptic serotonin release in the human brain, and when combined with a d-amphetamine challenge, the evaluation of the human brain serotonin system in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depression and Parkinson's disease is enabled.
