	Purpose. To examine the effect of changes in plasma alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) levels on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics OPD) of lerisetron, a novel serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, in the rat. Methods. After subcutaneous administration of turpentine oil, AAG was significantly elevated compared with controls. The PK of unchanged lerisetron (UL; high-performance liquid chromatography with radioactivity monitoring) and total lerisetron (TL; unchanged + changed, scintillation counting) was characterized post intravenous (i.v.) (14)Clerisetron (50 mug/kg) in control and turpentine oil pretreated rats. The PK (0 - 180 min) was described by a two-compartmental model. Protein binding of lerisetron in vitro was measured using an ultrafiltration technique. The effect of lerisetron (5 mug/kg, i.v.) over 180 min was measured in anesthetized rats (control and pretreated) with the Bezold-Jarisch reflex (inhibition of bradycardia after 16 mug/kg serotonin i.v.) as the endpoint. PD parameters were estimated by sigmoid E-max models. Results. The unbound fraction was significantly diminished in pre treated rats (mean +/- SEM) (6.60 +/- 1.23% vs. control 14.4 +/- 1.40%, P < 0.05). Volume of distribution (V) and clearance for UL and TL were significantly decreased when compared to the controls (P < 0.0001 for UL and P < 0.05 for TL). Plasma clearance based on unbound concentration for UL did not differ between groups but the unbound V and steady-state unbound V remained decreased (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001). Pretreated rats showed a significantly diminished drug effect: the area under the E-t curve over 180 min was (mean <plus/minus> SEM) 5189 +/- 657.7 in control animals vs. 3456 +/- 464.4 in the pretreated group (P < 0.05). The EC50 (concentration at half maximum effect) for UL and TL were increased in pretreated rats and were not compensated when the unbound concentration was used. Conclusions: An increase in AAG causes alterations in the PK and PD of lerisetron, and because this is not compensated with the unbound concentration, we suggest that mechanisms not linked to protein binding may be involved.
