	1 A cloned cDNA encoding a human 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) receptor type A subunit (h5-HT(3)R-A(s)) was transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells maintained in cell culture and a stable cell line expressing a high density of the recombinant receptor was selected. 2 Membrane homogenates prepared from transfected, but not untransfected, cells exhibited a homogeneous and saturable population (B-max = 4.49 +/- 0.46 pmol mg(-1) protein) of sites that bound the radiolabelled 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, [H-3]-granisetron with high affinity (pK(D) = 8.87 +/- 0.08). Kinetic studies (at 37 degrees C) revealed rapid association (k(+ 1) = 4.76 +/- 0.3 x 10(8) M(-1) min(-1)) and dissociation (k(- 1) = 0.21 +/- 0.003 min(-1)) of the radioligand. 3 Selective and non-selective 5-HT3 receptor ligands competed for [H-3]-granisetron binding with a rank order of potency (granisetron > ondansetron > meta-chlorophenylbiguanide > 5-HT > 2-methyl-5-HT > metoclopramide > > phenylbiguanide > cocaine>(+)-tubocurarine) identical to that established for 5-HT3 receptors endogenous to the human CNS. 4 In electrophysiological recordings performed on transfected cells, voltage-clamped at a holding potential of -60 mV, locally applied 5-HT (10 mu M) evoked transient inward current responses that reversed in sign at a potential of -1.0 +/- 1.1 mV. Such responses were antagonized in a reversible manner by granisetron (1 nM). 5 The construction of a stable cell line expressing a high density of recombinant human 5-HT3 receptors which display appropriate pharmacology and function will assist in the further characterization of this receptor subtype and the exploration of species differences in 5-HT3 receptor pharmacology.
