Willins, D. L. and H. Y. Meltzer (1998). "Serotonin 5-HT2C agonists selectively inhibit morphine-induced dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens." Brain Res 781(1-2): 291-299.

	In vivo microdialysis was used to compare the effects of serotonergic drugs on morphine- and cocaine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine (DA) concentrations in the rat nucleus accumbens (NAc). Systemic administration of the 5-HT2A/2C agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) (2.5 mg/kg, s.c. ) prevented the increase in extracellular DA in the NAc produced by morphine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). In contrast, this dose of DOI had no effect on the ability of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) to increase extracellular DA concentrations in the NAc. A 5-HT2C selective agonist, 6-chloro-2-[1-piperazinyl]-pyrazine (MK-212, 5 mg/kg, s.c.) also inhibited morphine-induced increases in extracellular DA concentrations in the NAc. Pretreatment of rats with the selective 5-HT2A antagonist, amperozide, had no effect on morphine-induced elevation of NAc DA concentrations. In order to determine if inhibition of the firing of 5-HT neurons contributes to the serotonin agonist-mediated inhibition of morphine-induced accumbens DA release, rats were pretreated with the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OHDPAT. At a dose of 100 microg/kg (sc), 8-OHDPAT did not interfere with morphine's ability to increase DA concentrations in the NAc. These results suggest that the activation of 5-HT2C receptors selectively inhibits morphine-induced DA release in the NAc in a manner which is independent of the inhibition of 5-HT neurons.
