	The 5-HT4 receptor may play a role in memory and learning and 5-HT4 receptor activation has been suggested to modulate acetylcholine release and to reduce amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulation. The aim of this study was for the first time to investigate the in vivo cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding in early Alzheimer disease (AD) patients in relation to cortical A beta burden. Eleven newly diagnosed untreated AD patients (mean MMSE 24, range 19-27) and twelve age-and gender-matched healthy controls underwent a two-hour dynamic [C-11]SB207145 PET scan to measure the binding potential of the 5-HT4 receptor. All AD patients and eight healthy controls additionally underwent a [C-11]PIB PET scan to measure the cortical A beta burden. When AD patients were defined on clinical criteria, no difference in cerebral 5-HT4 receptor binding between AD patients and healthy controls was found (p = 0.54). However, when individuals were reassigned to groups according to their amyloid status, the PIB-positive individuals had 13% higher 5-HT4 receptor levels than PIB-negative individuals (p = 0.02) and the importance of classification of groups is emphasized. The 5-HT4 receptor binding was a positively correlated to A beta burden (p = 0.03) and negatively to MMSE score of the AD patients (p = 0.02). Our data suggests that cerebral 5-HT4 receptor upregulation starts at a preclinical stage of and continues while dementia is still at a mild stage, which contrasts other receptor subtypes. We speculate that this may either be a compensatory effect of decreased levels of interstitial 5-HT, an attempt to improve cognitive function, increase acetylcholine release or to counteract A beta accumulation.
