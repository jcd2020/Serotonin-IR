Higgins, G. A. and P. J. Elliott (1991). "Differential behavioural activation following intra-raphe infusion of 5-HT1A receptor agonists." Eur J Pharmacol 193(3): 351-356.

	Microinfusion of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT), into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) produced a marked behavioural hypoactivity and flat body posture. Injections of similar doses into the median raphe nucleus (MRN) elicited hyperactivity but no postural change. Reductions in rearing and grooming were also observed after DRN and MRN infusions of 8-OHDPAT. The behavioural profiles of other 5-HT1A selective compounds, gepirone and BMY7378 were found to be similar to 8-OHDPAT. The contrasting behavioural profiles of the 5-HT1A agents observed after DRN or MRN microinfusions are probably related to the differential innervation of forebrain structures by each raphe nucleus. Thus, the present data confirms and extends previous results illustrating the influence of 5-HT systems on motor behaviour in the rat and identifies unique behavioural profiles following activation of the DRN and MRN.
