	[(18)F]Altanserin has emerged as a promising positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for serotonin-2A (5-HT(2A)) receptors. The deuterium substitution of both of the 2'-hydrogens of altanserin ([(18)F]deuteroaltanserin) yields a metabolically more stable radiotracer with higher ratios of parent tracer to radiometabolites and increased specific brain uptake than [(18)F]altanserin. The slower metabolism of the deuterated analog might preclude the possibility of achieving stable plasma and brain activities with a bolus plus constant infusion within a reasonable time frame for an (18)F-labeled tracer (T(1/2) 110 min). Thus, the purpose of this study was to test the feasibility in human subjects of a constant infusion paradigm for equilibrium modeling of [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin with PET. Seven healthy male subjects were injected with [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin as a bolus plus constant infusion lasting 10 h postinjection. PET acquisitions and venous blood sampling were performed throughout the infusion period. Linear regression analysis revealed that time-activity curves for both specific brain uptake and plasma [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin concentration stabilized after about 5 h. This permitted equilibrium modeling and estimation of V(')(3) (ratio of specific uptake to total plasma parent concentration) and the binding potential V(3) (ratio of specific uptake to free plasma parent concentration). Cortical/cerebellar ratios were increased by 26% relative to those we previously observed with [(18)F]altanserin using similar methodology in a somewhat older subject sample. These results demonstrate feasibility of equilibrium imaging with [(18)F]deuteroaltanserin and suggest that it may be superior to [(18)F]altanserin as a PET radioligand.
