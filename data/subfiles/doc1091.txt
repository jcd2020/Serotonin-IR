	Several reports have indicated that the brain serotonergic 5-HT3 receptors are involved in at least some central effects of ethanol in rats. However, using an operant drug discrimination procedure, we have shown that these receptors are not primarily involved in the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol. The aim of the present study was to further elucidate the role of 5-HT3 receptors in the formation of the ethanol-cueing effects in rats. To this purpose, a crossfamiliarization conditioned taste aversion (CF-CTA) procedure was used. Four daily injections of 1.5 g/kg ethanol (10% v/v) resulted in a significant attenuation of the subsequent ethanol-induced CTA. In contrast, four daily injections of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (mCPBG; 50 microg per rat, i.c.v.) did not alter the subsequent ethanol-induced CTA. The 50 microg dose of mCPBG produced a marked CTA in a control experiment. These results taken together with some previous findings from our laboratory suggest that the brain 5-HT3 receptors do not play any crucial role in the mediation of the discriminative stimulus effects of ethanol.
