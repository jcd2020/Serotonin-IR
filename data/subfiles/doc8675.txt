	Drugs of abuse, such as amphetamine, share the ability to activate the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. The behavioral effects of amphetamine are mediated in large part by increasing DA neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens. However, there is evidence that serotonin (5-HT) systems may regulate forebrain DA function. Present study examined the role of 5-TH1B/2C receptors on the discriminative stimulus properties of amphetamine using conditioned taste aversion (CTA) as the drug discrimination procedure. Male Wistar rats were deprived of water and trained in the CTA procedure. They received the administration of amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) before a 10 min period of access to sucrose and followed by an injection of LiCl; on alternate days, subjects received saline before and after the access to sucrose. After rats learned amphetamine-saline discrimination, amphetamine was substituted by different doses of RU24969 (5-TH1B agonist) or mCPP (5-TH2C/1B agonist). It was observed that effects of 5-THIB/2C receptor agonists partially substituted for effects of amphetamine. These data suggest that 5-HT system play a regulatory role in the discriminative properties of amphetamine.
