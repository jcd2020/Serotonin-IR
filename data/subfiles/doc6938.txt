Kuroda, Y., et al. (1994). "EFFECTS OF ADRENALECTOMY AND TYPE-I OR TYPE-II GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR ACTIVATION ON 5-HT1A AND 5-HT2 RECEPTOR-BINDING AND 5-HT TRANSPORTER MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION IN RAT-BRAIN." Brain Res 648(1): 157-161.

	We evaluated the effects of adrenalectomy (ADX) and replacement with glucocorticoid receptor agonists on serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor binding in rat brain. 5-HT1A receptor binding was increased in the CA2-CA4 and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus 1 week after ADX. This effect was prevented by the systemic administration of aldosterone (10 mu g/mu l/h) but not by RU28362 (10 mu g/mu l/h). No significant effect was observed on 5-HT2 receptor binding in rat cortex. The expression of 5-HT transporter mRNA was unchanged in the raphe nucleus as measured by in situ hybridization.
