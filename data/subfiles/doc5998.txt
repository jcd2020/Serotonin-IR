Kuroki, T., et al. (2000). "R(+)-8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, attenuated amphetamine-induced dopamine synthesis in rat striatum, but not nucleus accumbens or medial prefrontal cortex." Brain Research 872(1-2): 204-207.

	R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.05, but not 0.025, 0.1, 1 mg/kg), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, decreased l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) accumulation in rat striatum following NSD-1015, an l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor. Amphetamine (1 mg/kg) increased striatal DOPA accumulation, an effect attenuated by R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg). However, both amphetamine (1 mg/kg) and R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg) decreased cortical DOPA accumulation; there were no additional decreases from their combination. Neither amphetamine (1 mg/kg), R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg), or the combination, significantly affected DOPA accumulation in the nucleus accumbens. The significance of and possible mechanisms for these findings are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
