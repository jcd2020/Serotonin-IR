Blanckaert, P., et al. (2007). "Synthesis and in vivo evaluation in mice of (I-123)-(4-fluorophenyl)(1-(3-iodophenethyl)piperidin-4-yl) methanone as a potential SPECT-tracer for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor." Journal of Labelled Compounds & Radiopharmaceuticals 50(3-4): 183-188.

	This work reports the synthesis, radiolabelling and in vivo evaluation in NMRI mice of [I-123]-(4-fluorophenyl)[1-(3-iodophenethyl)piperidin-4-yl]methanone ([I-123]-3-I-CO) as a potential SPECT tracer for the 5-HT2A receptor. The tributylstannylprecursor was synthesized with a 15% overall yield. Radiolabelling was performed using an electrophilic iododestannylation with yields of 85%. Radiochemical purity was always >95%. Log P was determined to be 3.10 +/- 0.10. The tracer showed good uptake in mouse brain (6.3 +/- 1.3% ID/g tissue at 10 min p.i., 2 +/- 0.36% ID/g tissue at I h p.i.). These results warrant further research in larger animals to determine suitability of [I-123]-3-I-CO as a 5-HT2A tracer. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
