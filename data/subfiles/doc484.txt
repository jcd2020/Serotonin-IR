Aulakh, C. S., et al. (1994). "FUNCTIONAL AND BIOCHEMICAL-EVIDENCE FOR ALTERED SEROTONERGIC FUNCTION IN THE FAWN-HOODED RAT STRAIN." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 49(3): 615-620.

	Administration of various doses of DOI (a 5-HT2A/5-HT2C agonist) produced hyperthermia that was significantly less in the FH rat strain relative to the Wistar rat strain. Similarly, administration of various doses of ipsapirone (a 5-HT1A agonist) produced hypothermia that was significantly less in the FH rat strain relative to the Wistar rat strain. Furthermore, m-CPP (a 5-HT agonist)-induced increases in growth hormone levels were also significantly less in the FH rat strain relative to the Wistar rat strain. There was no significant difference in the levels of either 5-HT or 5-HIAA between the two rat strains in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and striatum. In the brain stem, however, both 5-HT and 5-HIAA levels were significantly lower in the FH rat strain relative to the Wistar rat strain. On the other hand, 5-HT turnover rate was significantly higher in the hypothalamus and striatum and significantly lower in the hippocampus in the FH rat strain relative to the Wistar rat strain. These findings provide further evidence for altered serotonergic function in the FH rat strain and, in addition, suggest that the FH rat strain may prove to be a useful genetic model for some neuropsychiatric disorders with possible abnormalities in serotonergic function such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and the eating disorders.
