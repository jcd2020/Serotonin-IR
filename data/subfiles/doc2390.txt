Davies, M. F., et al. (1987). "Two distinct effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine on single cortical neurons." Brain Res 423(1-2): 347-352.

	The ability of the indoleamine serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) to alter membrane characteristics of neocortical neurons was analyzed using intracellular recording techniques. The present study demonstrates that 5-HT primarily depolarized 68% of cortical neurons probably by decreasing a resting K+ conductance, an effect blocked by the antagonists ritanserin and cinanserin and apparently mediated by 5-HT2 receptors. A hyperpolarization associated with an increased conductance state and insensitive to 5-HT2 antagonists was observed in 26% of the neurons and could be mimicked by the selective 5-HT1A agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propyl-amino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Therefore cortical pyramidal neurons contain at least two distinct functional 5-HT receptors whose activation produces opposing effects on membrane potential and conductance.
