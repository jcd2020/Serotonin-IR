Salchner, P. and N. Singewald (2006). "5-HT receptor subtypes involved in the anxiogenic-like action and associated Fos response of acute fluoxetine treatment in rats." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 185(3): 282-288.

	RATIONALE: We have recently reported that acute treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine exacerbates escape responses to airjet and facilitates airjet-induced activation of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. OBJECTIVE: Here we aimed to identify the 5-HT receptor subtype(s) mediating the anxiogenic-like effects of acute fluoxetine in this paradigm and to study whether chronic fluoxetine treatment would alter these responses. METHODS: The expression of the immediate early gene c-fos was used as a marker of neuronal activation. RESULTS: Acute fluoxetine increased the airjet-induced escape behaviour and Fos expression in the LC of saline-pretreated rats. Pretreatment with the 5-HT(2C/2B) antagonist SB 206553, but not with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635, the 5-HT1B antagonist SB 224289 or the 5-HT3 antagonist Y-25130 inhibited the fluoxetine-induced increase in escape behaviour and the associated elevated LC Fos response. The selective 5-HT2C agonist MK-212 mimicked the anxiogenic response of fluoxetine. Chronic treatment with fluoxetine abolished the anxiogenic-like effect and led to a normalization of the enhanced fluoxetine-induced Fos response to airjet. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results indicate that the anxiogenic-like effect as well as the facilitated neuronal reactivity induced by acute fluoxetine in the airjet model is mediated primarily by activation of 5-HT2C receptors.
