Eison, A. S., et al. (1993). "5-HT-dependent myoclonus in guinea pigs: mediation through 5-HT1A-5-HT2 receptor interaction." Brain Res Bull 30(5-6): 687-689.

	Investigations utilizing agonists for 5-HT receptor subtypes have been conducted to determine which 5-HT receptor subtype(s) subserve myoclonus in the guinea pig. Administration of a nonselective 5-HT agonist such as 5-MeODMT (5-HT1A/5-HT2 agonist) induces a dose-dependent behavior characterized by head jerking at low doses (1-2 mg/kg, SC) and full-blown myoclonus (continuous rhythmic whole-body jerking) at higher doses (2.5-5 mg/kg, SC). In contrast, the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI do not induce myoclonus, and elicit only limited head jerking across an otherwise behaviorally active range of doses (1-5 mg/kg, SC). Importantly, the coadministration of both 8-OH-DPAT and DOI results in the emergence of dose-dependent myoclonic behavior. These data suggest that coactivation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors may be required for the induction of myoclonus in the guinea pig.
