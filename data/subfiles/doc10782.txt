Svartengren, J., et al. (1997). "Interaction of the novel antipsychotic drug amperozide and its metabolite FG5620 with central nervous system receptors and monoamine uptake sites: relation to behavioral and clinical effects." Biol Psychiatry 42(4): 247-259.

	Behavioral, biochemical, and electrophysiological studies suggest that amperozide affects mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine neurotransmission. The receptor binding profile of amperozide is discussed and related to behavioral and clinical, i.e., antipsychotic, effects of the drug. As previously reported, amperozide displayed high affinity for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors (Ki = 16 nmol/L), and moderate affinity for striatal dopamine D2 (Ki = 540 nmol/L) and cortical alpha 1-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 172 nmol/L). In the present study amperozide displayed low affinity for several serotonin receptor subtypes as well as for the dopamine D4 receptor transfected in COS7 cells (Ki D4.2 = 769 nmol/L and Ki D4.4 = 384 nmol/L). Amperozide was very weak or did not interact with several other receptor species including adrenergic, histaminergic, muscarinic, benzodiazepine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, amino acid, opiate, and Ca channels; however, amperozide was found to compete for [3H]paroxetine binding for the serotonin transporter in the nanomolar range (Ki = 49 nmol/L). In vitro and in vivo binding potency of amperozide correlates best with behavioral effects, indicating 5-HT2A antagonism, although serotonin uptake inhibition may contribute to the effects of amperozide on dopamine neurotransmission. The metabolite of amperozide, FG5620, displayed 5-10 times lower pharmacologic activity than amperozide. These properties of amperozide may suggest that the antipsychotic effects of amperozide are mediated by 5-HT2A receptors, although 5-HT uptake inhibition and alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects may be considered, particularly at higher doses.
