	Identifying the factors contributing to the etiology of anxiety and depression is critical for the development of more efficacious therapies. Serotonin (5-HT) is intimately linked to both disorders. The inhibitory serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor exists in two separate populations with distinct effects on serotonergic signaling: (1) an autoreceptor that limits 5-HT release throughout the brain and (2) a heteroreceptor that mediates inhibitory responses to released 5-HT. Traditional pharmacologic and transgenic strategies have not addressed the distinct roles of these two receptor populations. Here we use a recently developed genetic mouse system to independently manipulate 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor and heteroreceptor populations. We show that 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors act to affect anxiety-like behavior. In contrast, 5-HT(1A) heteroreceptors affect responses to forced swim stress, without effects on anxiety-like behavior. Together with our previously reported work, these results establish distinct roles for the two receptor populations, providing evidence that signaling through endogenous 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors is necessary and sufficient for the establishment of normal anxiety-like behavior.
