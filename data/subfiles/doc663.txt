Barone, P., et al. (1993). "Quantitative autoradiography of 5-HT1E binding sites in rodent brains: effect of lesion of serotonergic neurones." Eur J Pharmacol 249(2): 221-230.

	Binding sites corresponding to 5-HT1E receptors were labelled in mouse, rat, and guinea-pig brains by using [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([3H]5-HT) in the presence of 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) (0.1 microM), and their distribution within the brain was studied by quantitative autoradiography. The results obtained with mouse brain show that 5-HT1E binding sites are particularly present in the cortex, caudate-putamen and claustrum, where they showed the highest density. Lower densities were measured in other regions. Saturation experiments showed that the affinity of [3H]5-HT for 5-HT1E binding sites (nanomolar range) was very similar in the different structures. The distribution of 5-HT1E binding sites was similar in rat and guinea-pig brains. In rat brain, selective lesioning of serotonergic fibres by intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), a specific 5-HT neurotoxin, did not affect the density of 5-HT1E binding, indicating that these receptors are mainly localized on non-serotonergic neurones.
