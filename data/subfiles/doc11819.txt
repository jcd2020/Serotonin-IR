Wikstr√∂m, H., et al. (1989). "Resolved 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-N,N-dimethyl-3H-benz[e]indol-8-amine: central dopamine and serotonin receptor stimulating properties." J Med Chem 32(10): 2273-2276.

	The enantiomers of 6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-N,N-dimethyl-3H-benz[e]indol-8- amine (1a) were prepared and tested for their actions on central dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) receptors. The dopaminergic effects were shown to reside in the (1)-R enantiomer. It was shown that compound 1a and its (+)-R enantiomer possess potent central 5-HT1A receptor stimulating properties.
