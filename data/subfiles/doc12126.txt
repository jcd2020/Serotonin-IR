	Behavioral and electrophysiological methods were used to study the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT) receptors on bladder and erectile function in the male rat. Postulated 5-HT1A [p-aminophenylethyl-m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (PAPP), 5-methoxydimethyltyramine (5-MeODMT)] and 5-HT1C/2 [MK212, m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP)] agonists did not consistently alter sensitivity voiding frequency (VF) in awake rats or affect micturition threshold (0.4 vs. 0.3 cc) in anesthetized rats. The 5-HT1B agonist Organon 6997 (ORG 6997) had no effect on pelvic nerve-induced detrusor contraction or evoked responses in bladder nerves. 5-HT1C/2 agonists abolished reflexly evoked bladder contractions by inhibiting efferent firing in the pelvic nerve. 5-HT1C/2 agonists also produced penile erections (2-5/30 min) via firing in cavernous nerves mediated by preganglionics in the pelvic nerve. Neural activity in the cavernous nerves following administration of MK212 and TFMPP was abolished by the 5-HT1C/2 antagonist mianserin. 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C/2 agonists failed to influence synaptic transmission in the pelvic ganglion. These data support a functional diversity of 5-HT receptor subtypes with selective excitation or inhibition of central autonomic pathways regulating pelvic visceral function. These observations suggest that 5-HT1C/2 agonists could be clinically useful for managing impotence or urinary incontinence.
