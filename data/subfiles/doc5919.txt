	Introduction: The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [F-18]altanserin is a promising ligand for in vivo brain imaging in rodents. However,[F-18]altanserin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in rats. Its applicability might therefore be constrained by both a differential expression of P-gp under pathological conditions, e.g. epilepsy, and its relatively low cerebral uptake. The aim of the present study was therefore twofold: (i) to investigate whether inhibition of multidrug transporters (MDT) is suitable to enhance the cerebral uptake of [F-18]altanserin in vivo and (ii) to test different pharmacokinetic, particularly reference tissue-based models for exact quantification of 5-HT2AR densities in the rat brain. Methods: Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats, either treated with the MDT inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA, 50 mg/kg, n = 8) or vehicle (n = 10) underwent 180-mM PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Kinetic analyses of tissue time-activity curves (TACs) were performed to validate invasive and non-invasive pharmacokinetic models. Results: CsA application lead to a two- to threefold increase of [F-18]altanserin uptake in different brain regions and showed a trend toward higher binding potentials (BPND) of the radioligand. Conclusions: MDT inhibition led to an increased cerebral uptake of [F-18]altanserin but did not improve the reliability of BPND as a non-invasive estimate of 5-HT2AR. This finding is most probable caused by the heterogeneous distribution of P-gp in the rat brain and its incomplete blockade in the reference region (cerebellum). Differential MDT expressions in experimental animal models or pathological conditions are therefore likely to influence the applicability of imaging protocols and have to be carefully evaluated.
