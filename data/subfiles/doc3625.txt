Fdez Espejo, E. and E. Gil (1997). "Single restraint stress sensitizes acute chewing movements induced by haloperidol, but not if the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT is given prior to stress." Brain Res 755(2): 351-355.

	The objective of this study was two-fold: (i) to analyze behavioral sensitization to haloperidol 2 weeks after single restraint stress, and (ii) to establish the effects of 8-OH-DPAT treatment prior to stress on sensitized behavioral responses. Overall behavior was analyzed and not only catalepsy, but also sedation (immobility), grooming, exploration and vacuous chewing movements were evaluated. Results indicated that single restraint stress induced a long-lasting sensitization of acute vacuous chewing movements induced by haloperidol (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg i.p.). Interestingly, this behavioral sensitization was prevented by 8-OH-DPAT (0.35 mg/kg s.c.) prior to stress. Finally, haloperidol-induced sedation was not disrupted by either restraint stress or 8-OH-DPAT treatment.
