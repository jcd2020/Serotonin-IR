	The results clearly indicate that the hippocampus, rather than nucleus accumbens is involved in mediating anxiolytic-like effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists. Furthermore, hippocampal postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors may account for the anti-emotional influence of this groups of drugs. As far as the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are concerned, it was more difficult to localize their central anti-anxiety like action. More clear and unequirocal effects could be observed after intra-accumbens, rather than after intrahippocampal injections of tropisetron and ondansetron.
