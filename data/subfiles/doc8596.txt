Parkinson, D., et al. (1989). "Identification and localization of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor sites in macaque visual cortex." Vis Neurosci 2(5): 515-525.

	The two main receptor subtypes for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) were measured and localized in visual cortical areas of macaque monkey. [3H]5HT was used to label all 5HT-1 receptor subtypes and [3H]ketanserin was used to label 5HT-2 receptors. Both receptor types could be demonstrated in membranes prepared from macaque primary visual cortex. The specificity of these ligands for 5HT-1 or 5HT-2 receptors was demonstrated by the pharmacological profile of inhibitors of the specific binding. 5HT-1A receptor sites were detected by displacement experiments and by direct labeling with [3H]8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino) tetralin 8OH-DPAT. Receptor autoradiography showed that the distribution of these receptor subtypes varied from one part of visual cortex to another. 5HT-1 receptors, labeled with [3H]5HT were present in several bands through layer IV of primary visual cortex with the densest band seen in and above layer IVA: another band was in lower layer VI. The band in layer VI was predominantly 5HT-1A sites. There were two main bands of 5HT-2 receptor sites, the most prominent around the IV/V boundary, and the other extending from layer IVA upwards. Adjacent areas showed 5HT receptors in a broad band corresponding to layer IV. 5HT-1A sites were found in superficial layers of adjacent areas, except V2. These layering patterns did not correspond precisely with cytoarchitectonic layering, nor with the pattern of 5HT-containing presynaptic fibres in published reports. It is important, therefore, in considering the role of the 5HT-containing neurons in cortical function to take account not only of the anatomy of the presynaptic terminals, but also of the postsynaptic receptors upon which the released transmitter will act, and their location within the cortex.
