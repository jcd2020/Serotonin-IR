Inoue, A., et al. (1993). "EFFECTS OF DETERGENTS ON BINDING OF 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(3) RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST H-3 GR65630 TO RAT CORTICAL MEMBRANES." Neurochemistry International 22(6): 547-553.

	In the absence of detergent, specific binding of [H-3]GR65630, a 5-hydroxytryptamine3, (5-HT3) antagonist, determined in the presence of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS205-930, was at most 30% of the total binding. To decrease the level of nonspecific binding, the effects of detergents on [H-3]GR65630 binding to rat cortical membranes were investigated. The use of a detergent (0.1% Lubrol PX or Triton X-100) decreased nonspecific binding, increasing the proportion of specific binding to 70% of total binding. In the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100, binding of [H-3]GR65630 was rapid, reversible and saturable at 25-degrees-C. The rank order of 5-HT3 receptor active drugs in inhibiting [H-3]GR65630 binding was quipazine > ICS205-930 > 2-methyl-5-HT = 5-HT > metoclopramide, which confirmed that [H-3]GR65630 efficiently labeled 5-HT3 receptors in the presence of Triton X-100. Triton X-100 improved 5-HT3 receptor binding with rat brain membranes.
