	The ability to adapt to stress is an important defensive function of a living body, and impairment of this ability may contribute to some stress-related disorders. Thus, the examination of brain mechanisms involved in stress adaptation could help to pave the way for new therapeutic strategies for stress-related psychiatric disorders including mood disorders. The serotonin (5-HT)(7) receptor has recently been implicated in the regulation of emotionality as well as the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The present study therefore examine whether brain 5-HT7 receptors are involved in the development of stress adaptation. Mice exposed to acute restraint stress (60 min) exhibited the emotional responses detected as the decrease in head-dips in the hole-board test and access to open arms in the elevated plus maze test. These behavioral changes disappeared after chronic exposure to restraint stress for I week, indicating the development of stress adaptation. In contrast, intracerebroventricular administration of SB269970, a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, during stress exposure induced some behaviors that reflect the low anxiety sensitivity and/or impulsivity in the elevated plus maze test, i.e. the increase in access to open arms and head-dipping behavior together with the decrease in stretch-attend postures. Furthermore, hypersensitivity to tactile stimuli showing the vocalization was also observed. These findings suggest that brain 5-HT7 receptors may play a role in the development of stress adaptation.
