	To determine whether positron emission tomography (PET) can be used for imaging of neuroreceptors in eyes of rabbits. PET imaging of dopamine D(2) receptor, dopamine transporter, serotonin(1A) receptor and sigma(1) receptor in the eyes and brain was performed using corresponding positron-emitting ligands in baseline, pretreatment and displacement conditions. The 4 radioligands outlined the eyes and brain in the baseline. Pretreatment resulted in a slight reduction (26-28%) in the uptake in the anterior segments of eyes. The binding of each radioligand in the iris-ciliary body and retina was confirmed by ex vivo autoradiography. However, the PET signal in the eyes was unexpectedly higher than the autoradiography signal. The identification of radioligand-neuroreceptor binding by PET in the rabbit eyes is not specific enough.
