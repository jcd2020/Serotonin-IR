Bhattacharya, S. K. (1998). "Anticonvulsant activity of intraventricularly administered atrial natriuretic peptide and its inhibition by isatin." Biogenic Amines 14(2): 131-141.

	Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), administered intracerebroventricularly (icy) in the doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mu g/rat, exhibited a dose-related increase in the latency of onset and decrease In the incidence of clonic convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazole (60 mg/kg, i.p.) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (60 mg/kg, i.p.). Although these doses of ANP had little effect on electroshock-induced seizure-threshold, they induced a dose-related increase in the threshold when it was reduced in hydrated rats. An anxiogenic dose (20 mg/kg, i.p) of isatin attenuated the anticonvulsant action of ANP (1.0 mu g/rat). Isatin has been shown to function as a potent antagonist at ANP receptors in vitro and to inhibit the anxiolytic, memory-facilitating and diuretic actions of icy administered ANP in rats. The results indicate that centrally administered ANP exhibits significant anticonvulsant action and supports the role of isatin as an endogenous antagonist of ANP receptors. In view of the reported MAO B inhibitory and 5-HT3 receptor agonist effects of isatin, the endocoid may function as a possible link between the natriuretic peptidergic and monoaminergic neurotransmitter systems.
