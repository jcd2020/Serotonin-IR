	Galanin N-terminal fragment (1-15) [GAL(1-15)] is associated with depression-related and anxiogenic-like effects in rats. In this study, we analyzed the ability of GAL(1-15) to modulate 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AR), a key receptor in depression. GAL(1-15) enhanced the antidepressant effects induced by the 5-HT1AR agonist 8-OH-DPAT in the forced swimming test. These effects were stronger than the ones induced by Galanin (GAL). This action involved interactions at receptor level since GAL(1-15) affected the binding characteristics and the mRNA levels of 5-HT1AR in the dorsal hippocampus and dorsal raphe. The involvement of the GALR2 was demonstrated with the GALR2 antagonist M871. Proximity ligation assay experiments indicated that 5-HT1AR are in close proximity with GALR1 and GALR2 in both regions and in raphe RN33B cells. The current results indicate that GAL(1-15) enhances the antidepressant effects induced by 8-OH-DPAT acting on 5-HT1AR operating as postjunctional or as autoreceptors. These results may give the basis for the development of drugs targeting potential GALR1-GALR2-5-HT1AR heteroreceptor complexes linked to the raphe-hippocampal 5-HT neurons for the treatment of depression.
