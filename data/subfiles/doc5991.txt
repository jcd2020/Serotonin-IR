Kuribara, H. (1994). "EFFECTS OF SUN-8399, A POTENT AND SELECTIVE 5-HT1A AGONIST, ON CONFLICT BEHAVIOR AND AMBULATORY ACTIVITY IN MICE - COMPARISON WITH THOSE OF BUSPIRONE, TANDOSPIRONE AND DIAZEPAM." Japanese Journal of Pharmacology 64(4): 273-280.

	Behavioral effects of p.o. administration of SUN 8399, a selective 5-HT1A agonist, on the operant behavior under a MULT VI 1.5 min/FR 5-punishment schedule of food reinforcement and on the ambulatory activity were evaluated in mice, and the characteristics were compared with those of other 5-HT1A agonists, buspirone and tandospirone, and the benzodiazepine diazepam. Diazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly increased the punished response without eliciting any significant change in the nonpunished response; i.e., showing anticonflict action. SUN 8399 (3 - 30 mg/kg) and buspirone (1 - 10 mg/kg) did not significantly change either the punished or non-punished responses. Tandospirone significantly increased the non-punished response at 10 mg/kg, but significantly decreased both the punished and nonpunished responses at 30 mg/kg. The single administration of SUN 8399 (10 mg/kg), buspirone (3 and 30 mg/kg) and tandospirone (10 and 30 mg/kg) significantly increased the ambulatory activity, while diazepam tended to decrease it. The ambulation-increasing effect of methamphetamine (2 mg/kg, s.c.) was reduced by buspirone (10 and 30 mg/kg) and tandospirone (10 and 30 mg/kg), but enhanced by diazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg). Buspirone (30 mg/kg), tandospirone (10 and 30 mg/kg) and diazepam (3 and 10 mg/kg) significantly reduced the ambulation-increasing effect of scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). SUN 8399 (3 - 100 mg/kg) did not modify the effects of either methamphetamine or scopolamine. The present results suggest that 5-HT1A agonists scarcely show anticonflict action on the Geller-type conflict behavior in mice. However, SUN 8399 possesses different behavioral characteristics from those of the other two 5-HT1A agonists in terms of interactions with methamphetamine and scopolamine.
