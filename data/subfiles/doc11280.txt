Uphouse, L., et al. (1994). "Hypothalamic infusion of the 5-HT2/1C agonist, DOI, prevents the inhibitory actions of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, on lordosis behavior." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 47(3): 467-470.

	Sexually receptive, intact, proestrous rats were infused bilaterally into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN) with 200 ng of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), with 2000 ng of the 5-HT2/1C agonist, (+/-)-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI), or with both 8-OH-DPAT and DOI. Alone, VMN infusions of 8-OH-DPAT, but not DOI, inhibited lordosis behavior. When 2000 ng DOI was infused simultaneously with 8-OH-DPAT, the inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT were completely abolished. These results suggest that neural sites responsible for the reported facilitatory effects of 5-HT2/1C agonists on lordosis behavior coexist in the VMN with those sites in which 5-HT1A agonists are effective in reducing lordosis behavior. In contrast to the protective action of the 5-HT2/1C receptor agonist following VMN infusion, no protection was seen when both DOI and 8-OH-DPAT were administered intraperitoneally. Thus, the interaction of these two receptor subtypes in the control of lordosis behavior may be different in regions outside the VMN.
