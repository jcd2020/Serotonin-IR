	The aim of this study was to assess human striatal dopamine receptor 2 (D-2) and cortical 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 2A (5-HT2A) occupancy of SB-773812 to demonstrate brain penetration and binding to the target receptors and assess the pharmacokinetics-receptor occupancy relationship over time to aid dose selection and dosage regimen, in preparation for the phase II trials. Methods: D-2 and 5-HT2A occupancy were measured over time (both at the time of maximum [T-max; 6 +/- 2 h] and at the time of minimum [T-trough; 24 +/- 4 h] plasma concentration after dosing) by means of I-123-iodobenzamide and I-123-4-amino-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy) propyl]-4-methyl-4piperidinyl] 5-iodo-2-methoxybenzamide (I-123-R91150) SPECT in 3 studies. Study A consisted of SB-773812 single doses in healthy volunteers-D-2 occupancy measured at 48 (n = 9) and 56 mg (n = 9) and 5-HT2A occupancy at 56 mg (n = 9); study B consisted of D-2 and 5-HT2A occupancy measured in 12 stabilized-schizophrenia patients on stable doses (16-18 d of 56 mg/d) after washout of previous medication; and study C included D-2 occupancy measured in a double-blind study of patients with acutely exacerbated schizophrenia (n =10) on stable doses (18-21 d) of SB-773812 (100 mg/d; n = 7) or risperidone (6 mg/d; n = 3). Results: Study A showed less than 30% D-2 occupancy at Tmax, maintained at Ttrough. 5-HT2A occupancy was 74%-97% and also maintained over time. Study B revealed that 8 of the 12 schizophrenia patients showed more than 40% D-2 occupancy. 5-HT2A occupancy ranged from 91% to 100%. In study C, SB-773812-induced D-2 occupancy was 60.3% +/- 13.3% at T-max and 55.1% +/- 4.9% at Ttrough. The pharmacokinetics-receptor occupancy relationship was assessed in each study and strengthened, combining all data to yield a concentration associated with 50% occupancy (EC50) of 92.7 +/- 13.5 ng/mL for D-2 and 2.11 +/- 0.50 ng/mL for 5-HT2A. Conclusion: In all subjects, SB-773812 showed penetration into the brain, reaching its target receptors. In patients with schizophrenia, D-2 occupancy levels induced by a single dose were maintained over time, indicating that once-daily dosing regimens are appropriate. Pharmacokinetics-receptor occupancy analysis provided guidance for the selection of a clinically effective dose, supporting progression in phase II.
