Ponzoni, A., et al. (1995). "Increased waking after intra-accumbens injection of m-chlorophenylbiguanide: prevention with serotonin or dopamine receptor antagonists." Eur J Pharmacol 278(2): 111-115.

	Bilateral injection of the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguanide (5.0-40.0 micrograms) into the nucleus accumbens of the rat significantly increased waking and decreased slow wave sleep. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep remained unchanged. Pretreatment with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL 72222 (1aH,3a,5a, H-tropan-3-yl-3,5-dichloro-benzoate) (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) reversed the effects of m-chlorophenylbiguanide (10.0-20.0 micrograms) on sleep and waking. Blockade of the dopamine D1 or D2 receptor with (+)-SCH 23390 (0.25 mg/kg s.c.) or YM-09151-2 (cis-N-(1-benzyl-2-methylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-5-chloro-2-methoxy-4- methylaminobenzamide) (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), respectively antagonized the increase of waking and reduction of slow wave sleep induced by m-chloro-phenylbiguanide (10.0 micrograms). Our results tend to indicate that the increase of wakefulness after injection of the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguanide into the nucleus accumbens is partly related to the release of endogenous dopamine. In addition, they suggest that concomitant stimulation of both accumbens dopamine D1 and D2 receptor-related mechanisms is a necessary prerequisite to increase wakefulness.
