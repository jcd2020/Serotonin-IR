Rousselle, J. C., et al. (1998). "Specific interaction of 5-HT-moduline with human 5-HT1b as well as 5-HT1d receptors expressed in transfected cultured cells." Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archives of Pharmacology 358(3): 279-286.

	5-HT1B receptors are the predominant auto- and heteroreceptors located on serotonergic and non-serotonergic terminals where they regulate the neuronal release of neurotransmitters. 5-HT-moduline (Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu) has been shown to specifically interact with a very high apparent affinity and in a non-competitive manner with 5-HT1B receptors (Massot et al. 1996; Rousselle et al. 1996). Using transfected cells expressing either 5-HT1B or 5-HT1D receptors, it was shown that 5-HT-moduline prevents the binding of [H-3]5-HT to 5-HT1B as well as to 5-HT1D receptors with similar biochemical characteristics: the IC50 of the peptide was 1.2x10(-12) M for 5-MT1B and 9x10(-13) M for 5-HT1D receptors. The observed effect corresponds to a marked decrease of the maximal binding for [H-3]5-HT on 5-HT1B (-51.2+/-1%) as well as 5-HT1D binding (-47.2+/-7.7% of the control binding) whereas the affinity of 5-HT is increased by a factor close to 3. No effect is observed using the "scrambled" peptide (Ala-Leu-Leu-Ser). Parallel assays using transfected cells expressing 5-HT1A or 5-ht(6) receptors did not show any significant change induced by the peptide under similar assay conditions. The interaction of the peptide was also studied on the functional activity related to the stimulation of the receptors as measured by the increase in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding reflecting the coupling of the receptor to the G-protein. 5-HT-moduline yields an antagonistic effect on the 5-HT induced coupling with a corresponding IC50=1.2+/-0.7x10(-12) M for 5-HT1B and 9.8+/-4.0x10(-12) M for 5-HT1D receptors, respectively. The present results demonstrate that 5-HT-moduline interacts with 5-HT1D as well as 5-HT1B receptors and possesses a non-competitive antagonistic activity, likely corresponding to its role of endogenous allosteric modulator, specific for both 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.
