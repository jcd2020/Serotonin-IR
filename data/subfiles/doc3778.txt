	In previous studies, we showed that light-induced Fos protein expression in the ventrolateral SCN is markedly inhibited by the nonselective serotonergic, quipazine. The present experiments were undertaken to characterize the effects of various serotonin (5-HT) receptor ligands on photic signalling in the SCN. The extent of expression of light-induced Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) in the SCN was used as a marker for this response. Exposure of hamsters to a light pulse delivered during the latter part of the dark phase (7 h after lights-off; LD 14:10) elicited an intense expression of Fos-LI in nuclei of cells situated principally in the ventrolateral region of the SCN. Pretreatment with an i.p. injection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, 8-OH-DPAT or buspirone, 30 min before the light pulse significantly inhibited the photic expression of Fos-LI (maximal suppression 45.7 +/- 8.1 and 43.0 +/- 1.3%, respectively, both P < 0.01 vs. vehicle controls). Treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, NAN-190, administered 15 min before 8-OH-DPAT injection prevented the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT (100.9 +/- 6.0% vs. controls, P > 0.9). Pretreatment with the 5-HT1B receptor agonist, TFMPP, caused a small but significant suppression of Fos-LI (14.8 +/- 3.5% vs. controls, P < 0.05). In contrast to the significant 5-HT1 receptor agonist effects, pretreatment with 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 receptor agonists, alpha-methyl-5-HT and 1-phenylbiguanide had little suppressive effect on Fos-LI (7.9 +/- 2.1 and 13.0 +/- 5.0% suppression, respectively, both P > 0.1 vs. controls).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
