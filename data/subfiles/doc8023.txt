Navarro, J. F., et al. (2004). "Behavioral profile of SB 269970, a selective 5-HT7 serotonin receptor antagonist, in social encounters between male mice." Methods and Findings in Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology 26(7): 515-518.

	The 5-HT7 receptor is targeted by several antipsychotics, such as pimozide or clozapine, which have demonstrated antiaggressive properties in laboratory animal models. Likewise, 'in situ' hybridization and autoradiography studies have revealed moderate to high densities of 5-HT7 receptors in limbic areas and hypothalamus, which have long been involved in the control of aggression. However, to date there is no evidence concerning the role of this receptor in the regulation of aggression. This study was designed to examine the effects of SB 269970 (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, on agonistic behavior elicited by isolation in mice. Individually housed mice were exposed to anosmic standard opponents 15 min after drug administration and encounters were videotaped and evaluated using an ethopharmacologically-based analysis. The results indicated that SB 269970 did not produce any significant behavioral changes, suggesting that 5-HT7 receptors might not be involved in the modulation of aggression. Further studies with other selective ligands for these receptors are needed to confirm these findings. (C) 2004 Prous Science. All rights reserved.
