	We investigated the anxiolytic effects and mechanism of action of a new anxiolytic drug, (R)-piperonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro[1]benzothieno[2,3-c]pyridine-3- carboxamide hydrochloride (AP521). AP521 showed equal or more potent anxiolytic-like effects compared with diazepam, a benzodiazepine receptor agonist, or tandospirone, a partial 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonist, in three rat anxiety models; the Vogel-type conflict test, elevated plus maze test, and conditioned fear stress test. Although AP521 did not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor, it did bind to 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT5A and 5-HT7 receptors, and showed agonist activity for the human 5-HT1A receptor expressed in HEK293 cells. Tandospirone, which can stimulate the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe, tended to decrease extracellular 5-HT concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in rats. In contrast, AP521 increased extracellular 5-HT concentration. In addition, AP521 enhanced the anti-freezing effect of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the fear conditioning model in rats and enhanced the citalopram-caused increase of the extracellular 5-HT concentration in the mPFC. These results suggest that AP521 exhibits potent anxiolytic effects by acting as a postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist and by enhancing serotonergic neural transmission in the mPFC by a novel mechanism of action.
