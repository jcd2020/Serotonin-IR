Shimizu, S., et al. (2010). "Role of cortical and striatal 5-HT1A receptors in alleviating antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal disorders." Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 34(6): 877-881.

	Previous studies have revealed that 5-HT(1A) agonists ameliorate antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) through postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors. Here, we conducted an intracerebral microinjection study of (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin ((+/-)8-OH-DPAT) to determine the action site of the 5-HT(1A) agonist in alleviating EPS. Bilateral microinjection of(+/-)8-OH-DPAT (5 microg/1microL per side) either into the primary motor cortex (MC) or the dorsolateral striatum (dlST) significantly attenuated haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. The anticataleptic action of (+/-)8-OH-DPAT was more prominent with the MC injection than with the dlST injection. WAY-100135 (a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist) completely antagonized the reversal of haloperidol-induced catalepsy both by intracortical and intrastriatal (+/-)8-OH-DPAT. Furthermore, lesioning of dopamine neurons with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (30 mg/kg/day, i.p., for 4 days) did not alter the anti-EPS actions of (+/-)8-OH-DPAT in a mouse pole test. The present results strongly suggest that 5-HT(1A) agonist alleviates antipsychotic-induced EPS by activating postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors in the MC and dlST, probably through non-dopaminergic mechanisms.
