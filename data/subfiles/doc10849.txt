	Prior studies from this laboratory showed that in utero ethanol exposure severely retards the development of the serotonin (5-HT) system; we demonstrated a reduced concentration of 5-HT and 5-HT reuptake sites and alterations in the concentration of 5-HT1A receptors in ethanol-exposed offspring. These investigations also found that maternal treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone, prevented most of the ethanol-associated damage to the developing 5-HT system. In the present investigation, we investigated whether the ethanol-associated changes in the 5-HT system are due to a reduction of 5-HT neurons and whether any changes in the density of 5-HT neurons can be prevented by maternal treatment with another 5-HT1A agonist, ipsapirone. Using immunocytochemistry, we found that in utero ethanol exposure reduced the density of 5-HT immunopositive neurons in the dorsal raphe, median raphe and B9 neurons of postnatal day 5 (PN5) rats. In all three brain areas, the offspring of ethanol-fed, saline-treated dams exhibited a 28%-40% reduction in 5-HT neurons. Ipsapirone prevented the ethanol-induced reduction in 5-HT immunopositive neurons in the dorsal raphe, median raphe and B9 neurons. In the dorsal and median raphe of control offspring, ipsapirone did not alter the concentration of 5-HT neurons. However, this drug did reduce 5-HT neurons in the B9 region of the offspring of control-fed rats. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
