	The central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) system represents a fundamental component of the brain's control of energy homeostasis. Medications targeting the 5-HT pathway have been at the forefront of obesity treatment for the past 15years. Pharmacological agents targeting 5-HT receptors (5-HTR), in combination with genetic models of 5-HTR manipulation, have uncovered a role for specific 5-HTRs in energy balance and reveal the 5-HT2CR as the principal 5-HTR mediating this homeostatic process. Capitalising on this neurophysiological machinery, 5-HT2CR agonists improve obesity and glycaemic control in patient populations. The underlying therapeutic mechanism has been probed using model systems and appears to be achieved primarily through 5-HT2CR modulation of the brain melanocortin circuit via activation of pro-opiomelanocortin neurones signalling at melanocortin4 receptors. Thus, 5-HT2CR agonists offer a means to improve obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are conditions that now represent global challenges to human health.
