	In this study, we examined the influence of the actions of the halogenated phenylpiperazine LY 165,163 at dopamine D-1, D-2 and D-3 receptors on its 5-HT1A agonist properties in vivo. LY 165,163 displayed marked affinity at striatal rat (r)D-2 (pK(i) = 7.0), cloned rD(2) (pK(i) = 7.3), cloned rD(3) (pK(i) = 8.0), cloned human (h)D-2 (pK(i) = 7.2) and cloned hD(3) (pK(i) = 7.8) receptors, whereas its affinity at striatal rD(1) receptors was weak (pK(i) = 5.7). In contrast, the prototypical 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT displayed low affinity at each of these sites (pK(i) < 5.5). In vivo, LY 165,163 behaved as an antagonist at D-2 autoreceptors In enhancing the synthesis of dopamine throughout the brain. Consistently with antagonist properties at postsynaptic D-2 receptors, in unilateral substantia nigra-lesioned rats, the rotation elicited by the D-2 agonist quinpirole was potently blocked by LY 165,163, whereas that elicited by the D-1 agonist SKF 38393 was only weakly inhibited. In addition, LY 165,163 potently evoked prolactin secretion in rats and abolished apomorphine-induced climbing in mice. At native rat 5-HT1A receptors and cloned human 5-HT1A receptors, LY 165,163 (pK(i) values of 8.7 and 8.9, respectively) mimicked the high affinity of 8-OH-DPAT (pK(i) values of 9.0 and 9.2). Further, like 8-OH-DPAT, LY 165,163 acted as an agonist in inhibiting the firing of dorsal raphe nucleus neurons, in reducing striatal turnover of 5-HT and in eliciting both hypothermia and corticosterone secretion. However, in contrast to 8-OH-DPAT, LY 165,163 failed to evoke spontaneous tail-flicks (STFs). This difference probably reflects its D-2 antagonist properties because the induction of STFs by 8-OH-DPAT was, in contrast to its induction of hypothermia and corticosterone secretion, blocked by the preferential D-2 antagonist haloperidol. Moreover, in the presence of quinpirole and in the presence of a further dopaminergic agonist, apomorphine, LY 165,163 did elicit STFs. Further, STFs evoked by LY 165,163 in the presence of apomorphine were abolished by the 5-HT1A antagonists (-)-alprenolol, BMY 7378 and NAN-190. We conclude that LY 165,163 exhibits marked activity at both pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic D-2 (D-3 and D-1) receptors. The blockade of postsynaptic D-2 receptors masks its 5-HT1A agonist actions in a paradigm (STFs) that depends on functionally intact dopamine D-2 receptors for its expression.
