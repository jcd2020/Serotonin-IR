	5-HT-moduline is an endogenous cerebral tetrapeptide (LSAL) which specifically interacts as an allosteric modulator with 5-HT1B receptors controlling serotonergic activity [O. Massot, J.C. Rousselle, M.P. Fillion, B. Grimaldi, I. Cloez-Tayarani, A. Fugelli, N. Prudhomme, L. Seguin, B. Rousseau, M. Plantefol, R. Hen, G. Fillion, 5-Hydroxytryptamine-moduline, a new endogenous cerebral peptide, controls the serotonergic activity via its specific interaction with 5-hydroxytryptamine1B/1D receptors, Mol. Pharmacol. 50 (1996) 752-762; J.C. Rousselle, O. Massot, M. Delepierre, E. Zifa, G. Fillion, Isolation and characterization of an endogenous peptide from rat brain interacting specifically with the serotonergic1B receptor subtypes, J. Biol. Chem. 271 (1996) 726-735; J.C. Rousselle, M. Plantefol, M.P. Fillion, O. Massot, P.J. Pauwels, G. Fillion, Specific interaction of 5-HT-moduline with human 5-HT1b as well as 5-HT1d receptors expressed in transfected cultured cells, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 358 (1998) 279-286]. Cerebral tissue contents of 5-HT-moduline were determined in various rat brain areas after an acute restraint stress, and after repetition of this stress, to examine whether or not mechanisms involving this peptide could be affected by stress situations. The measurement of the peptide was carried out using specific polyclonal antibodies [B. Grimaldi, M.P. Fillion, A. Bonnin, J.C. Rousselle, O. Massot, G. Fillion, Immunocytochemical localization of neurons expressing 5-HT-moduline in the mouse brain, Neuropharmacology 36 (1997) 1079-1087] in a dot-ELISA (enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay) assay in cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, substantia nigra, striatum and in adrenal glands. Tissue contents of 5-HT-moduline progressively and transiently increased in most studied brain regions and reached a maximal value 20 min after the beginning of the restraint stress. The increase in 5-HT-moduline tissue contents represented 323% of the value observed in unstressed control animals in the cortex, 207% in the hippocampus, 149% in the hypothalamus and 156% in the substantia nigra. Thereafter, the peptide content of the latter tissues diminished during the last 20 min of restraint and returned to control values within 1 h after the end of the stress period. The striatum did not show any significant variation of 5-HT-moduline content during restraint stress. In adrenal glands, the 5-HT-moduline content rapidly decreased (60% of controls) after the beginning of the restraint stress, the effect of this stress being progressively less pronounced, still representing 80% of controls after 40 min. Repetition of the restraint stress daily for 3 weeks totally abolished the effect of the stress on variations of 5-HT-moduline tissue content in all the studied brain regions. These results show that an acute restraint stress induces a rapid and significant increase in the amount of 5-HT-moduline contained in various brain areas. This phenomenon is likely to be related to the stress-induced 5-HT1B receptor desensitization which was previously demonstrated.
