	In studies using standard radioligands, unlabeled MDL 100,907 (R-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinemethanol) has been shown to have a high degree of selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor. The present study was undertaken to investigate the receptor binding characteristics of [H-3]MDL 100,907 in rat cortical homogenates. [H-3]MDL 100,907 was found to reach equilibrium at 37 degrees C after 15 min. Saturation experiments indicated binding to a single site with a KD of 0.56 nM, Hill slope of 1.15, and a B-max of 512 fmol/mg protein. In parallel experiments with the standard 5-HT2A receptor radioligand, [H-3]ketanserin, with prazosin added to block alpha(1) receptors, a similar Hill slope and B-max was noted but a two-fold higher K-D was found. In competition binding studies using 0.5 nM [H-3]MDL 100,907, some 19 standard ligands to various receptors including the 5-HT1A, D-2, alpha(1), and sigma receptors resulted in estimated K-I values that were consistent with [H-3]MDL 100,907 selectively binding to the 5-HT2A receptor. A comparison of the K-I values for 17 standard 5-HT2A receptor agonists and antagonists displacing [H-3]MDL 100,907 versus [H-3]ketanserin resulted in a highly significant linear correlation (R(2) = 0.96, P<0.001). Taken together these results suggest that [H-3]MDL 100,907 is binding to the 5-HT2A receptor with a sub-nanomolar affinity without the use of secondary blocking agents.
