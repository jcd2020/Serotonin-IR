	2-(2 ',6 '-Dimethoxy-[1,1 '-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine has been identified as a potent ligand for the serotonin 7 (5-HT7) receptor. In this study, we describe the synthesis, radiolabeling and in vivo evaluation of [C-11]2-(2 ',6 '-dimethoxy-[1,1 '-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine ([C-11]Cimbi-806) as a radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT7 receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). Precursor and reference compound was synthesized and subsequent C-11-labelling with [C-11]methyltriflate produced [C-11]Cimbi-806 in specific activities ranging from 50 to 300 GBq/mu mol. Following intravenous injection, brain uptake and distribution of [C-11]Cimbi-806 was assessed with PET in Danish Landrace pigs. The time-activity curves revealed high brain uptake in thalamic and striatal regions (SUV similar to 2.5) and kinetic modeling resulted in distribution volumes (V-T) ranging from 6 mL/cm(3) in the cerebellum to 12 mL/cm(3) in the thalamus. Pretreatment with the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 did not result in any significant changes in [C-11]Cimbi-806 binding in any of the analyzed regions. Despite the high brain uptake and relevant distribution pattern, the absence of appropriate in vivo blocking with a 5-HT7 receptor selective compounds renders the conclusion that [C-11]Cimbi-806 is not an appropriate PET radioligand for imaging the 5-HT7 receptor in vivo.
