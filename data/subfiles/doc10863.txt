	Objective: To determine the in vivo occupation of dopamine D-1, D-2 and serotonin (5-MT)(2A) receptors by novel antipsychotic agent sertindole using N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ), an irreversible antagonist at these receptor sites. Design: Animal study. interventions: Intraperitoneal administration to Wistar rats of I of 4 test compounds: a control compound of 0.15% tartaric acid, or a compound of either sertindole (0.5 mg/kg or 2.0 mg/kg) or clozapine (20 mg/kg) dissolved in 0.15% tartaric acid I hour before intraperitoneal administration of EEDQ (0 mg/kg) or ethanol/water solution. Results: Sertindole exhibited little or no effect on D and D, binding sites in vivo. On the other hand, sertindole occupied 5-HT2A receptors more extensively and firmly than EEDQ. This study indicates that sertindole is characterized by high occupancy of 5-HT2A receptors and by low or minimum occupancy of D-1 and D-2 receptors. Conclusions: These characteristics are very similar to atypical antipsychotic agents such as clozapine. Sertindole's low liability to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) may be related to greater long-term binding for 5-HT2A receptors relative to D-2 receptors.
