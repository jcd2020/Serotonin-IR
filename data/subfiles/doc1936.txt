Choi, Y. H., et al. (2007). "An inhibitory compound against the interaction between G alpha(s) and the third intracellular loop region of serotonin receptor subtype 6 (5-HT6) disrupts the signaling pathway of 5-HT6." Exp Mol Med 39(3): 335-342.

	Serotonin receptor subtype 6 (5-HT(6)) is a neurotransmitter receptor, which is involved in various brain functions such as memory and mood. It mediates signaling via the interaction with a stimulatory G-protein. Especially, the third intracellular loop (iL3) of 5-HT(6) and the alpha subunit of stimulatory G protein (G alpha(s)) are responsible for the signaling process of 5-HT(6). Chemical compounds that could inhibit the interaction between the iL3 region of 5-HT(6) and G alpha(s) were screened from a chemical library consisted of 5,600 synthetic compounds. One of the identified compounds bound to G alpha(s) and effectively blocked the interaction between G alpha(s) and the iL3 region of 5-HT(6). The identified compound was further shown to reduce the serotonin-induced accumulation of cAMP in 293T cells transformed with 5-HT(6) cDNA. It also lowered the Ca(2+) efflux induced by serotonin in cells expressing 5-HT(6) and chimeric G alpha(s5/q). These results indicate that the interaction between the iL3 of 5-HT(6) and G alpha(s) can be exploited for screening of regulatory compounds against the signaling pathway of 5-HT(6).
