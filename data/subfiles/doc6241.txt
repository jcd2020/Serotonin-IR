	Iloperidone has demonstrated an interesting monoamine receptor profile in radioligand binding studies, with nanomolar affinity for certain noradrenaline, dopamine, and serotonin receptors. In this study, the agonist/antagonist activity of iloperidone was determined in cell lines expressing recombinant human D-2A, D-3, alpha(2C), 5-HT1A, or 5-HT6 receptors. With the exception of 5-HT6 receptors, these receptors are negatively coupled to cyclase. Thus, after stimulation with forskolin, the agonists doparnine (at D-2A and D-3) noradrenaline (at alpha(2C)), or 8-OH-DPAT (at 5-HT) A) induced a reduction in cAMP accumulation. Conversely, activation of the 5-HT6 receptor by 5-HT led to an increase in cAMP accumulation. lloperidone alone was devoid of significant agonist activity but inhibited the agonist response in all 5 cell lines in a surmountable and concentration-dependent fashion. lloperidone was most potent at D3 receptors (pK(B) 8.59 +/- 0.20; n = 6), followed by alpha(2C) (pK(B) 7.83 +/- 0.06; n=15), 5-HT1A(pK(B) 7.69 +/- 0.18; n=10), D-2A (pK(B) 7.53 +/- 0.04; n = 11) and 5-HT6 (pK(B) 7.11 +/- 0.08; n = 11) receptors.
