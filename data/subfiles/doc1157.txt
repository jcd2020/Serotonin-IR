Bonhaus, D. W., et al. (1994). "[3H]RS-23597-190, a potent 5-hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist labels sigma-1 but not sigma-2 binding sites in guinea pig brain." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 271(1): 484-493.

	Recent findings have suggested a relationship between 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)4 receptors and sigma binding sites. To test this idea, the affinity of 5-HT4 receptor ligands for sigma binding sites was examined. In contrast to the 5-HT4 receptor ligands BIMU-1 [endo-N-(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl)-2,3- dihydro-3-ethyl-2-oxo-1H-benzimidazole-1-carboxamide hydrochloride] and BIMU-8 [endo-N-(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3- yl)-2,3-dihydro-(1-methyl)ethyl-2-oxo-1H-benzamidazole-1-carbox ami de hydrochloride], DAU 6215 ]N-(endo-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1.]oct-3-yl)-2,3-dihydro-2-oxo-1H- benzimidazole-1-carboxamide hydrochloride], 5-HT and 5-methoxytryptamine had low affinity for sigma binding sites (pKi < 6). Conversely, the sigma ligands haloperidol and pentazocine had low affinity for 5-HT4 receptors. Thus, no relationship was found between the affinity of ligands at 5-HT4 receptors and sigma binding sites. However, one potent 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, RS-23597-190 [3-(piperidine-1-yl)propyl-4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate hydrochloride], had high affinity for sigma-1 (pKi = 8.4) but not sigma-2 (pKi = 6.2) binding sites. [3H]RS-23597-190 bound to a saturable site with the pharmacology of a sigma-1 binding site: (pIC50) haloperidol (9.0) > (+)-pentazocine (8.8) > (+)-3-(hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine (8.2) > 1,3-di-o-tolyl-guanidine (8.0) > (-)-pentazocine (7.8) = (+)-SKF 10,047 [N-allylnormetazocine] > (-)-SKF 10,047 (6.2) > BIMU-1 (5.3) > 5-HT and 5-methoxytryptamine. The distribution of [3H]RS-23597-190 binding sites was similar to that described for other sigma radioligands, with the greatest binding densities in cranial nerve nuclei, the tegmental nucleus and in the mamillary nucleus. In contrast to (+)-3-(hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine, [3H]RS-23597-190 binding was not allosterically modulated by phenytoin. These studies do not support the notion of an obvious relationship between sigma and 5-HT4 receptors, but they provide additional insight into the structure/affinity relationship of ligands at specific sigma binding sites, and they uncover a novel sigma-1 receptor ligand whose binding is insensitive to the action of phenytoin.
