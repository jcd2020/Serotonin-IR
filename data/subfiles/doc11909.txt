Wood, M. D., et al. (2001). "SB-243213; a selective 5-HT2C receptor inverse agonist with improved anxiolytic profile: lack of tolerance and withdrawal anxiety." Neuropharmacology 41(2): 186-199.

	SB-243213 (5-methyl-1-[[-2-[(2-methyl-3-pyridyl)oxyl-5-pyridyl]carbamoyl]-6-trifluoromethylindoline hydrochloride) is a new, selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2C) receptor inverse agonist. SB-243213 has high affinity for the human 5-HT2C receptor (pK(i) 9.37) and greater than a 100-fold selectivity over a wide range of neurotransmitter receptors, enzymes and ion channels. In in vitro functional studies, SB-243213 acted as an inverse agonist at the human 5-HT2C receptor with a pK(b) of 9.8. In in vivo studies, SB-243213 was a potent inhibitor of central 5-HT2C receptor-mediated function in rats, blocking meta-chlorophenylpiperazine-induced hypolocomotion with an ID50 of 1.1 mg/kg p.o. and a long duration of action (>8 h). In rats, SB-243213 exhibited anxiolytic-like activity in both the social interaction and Geller-Seifter conflict tests. Importantly, unlike diazepam, chronic administration of SB-243213 did not result in the development of either tolerance to the anxiolytic-like effects or withdrawal anxiogenesis. Furthermore, in rodents, SB-243213 did not affect seizure threshold, did not increase body weight or induce catalepsy, but attenuated the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. SB-243213 did not affect amphetamine-, MK-801- or phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity. In conclusion, SB-243213 may possess an improved anxiolytic profile compared to benzodiazepines. SB-243213 also modulates dopaminergic transmission, lacks pro-psychotic properties and may have utility in the treatment of schizophrenia and motor disorders. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.
