	The 5-HT7 receptor has recently gained much attention due to its involvement in multiple physiological functions and diseases. The insufficient quality of the available molecular probes prompted design of fluorinated 3-(1-alkyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-1H-indoles as a new generation of selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists. A potent and drug-like agonist, 3-(1-ethyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-5-iodo-4-fluoro-1H-indole (AGH-192, 35, K-i (5-HT7R) = 4 nM), was identified by optimizing the halogen bond formation with Ser5.42 as the supposed partner. The compound was characterized by excellent water solubility, high selectivity over related CNS targets, high metabolic stability, oral bioavailability and low cytotoxicity. Rapid absorption into the blood, medium half-life and a high peak concentration in the brain C-max = 1069 ng/g were found after i.p. (2.5 mg/kg) administration in mice. AGH-192 may thus serve as the long-sought tool compound in the study of 5-HT7 receptor function, as well as a potential analgesic, indicated by the antinociceptive effect observed in a mouse model of neuropathic pain.
