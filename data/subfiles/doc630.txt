Bago, M., et al. (1999). "Modulation of sympathetic nerve activity by microinjection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT into the rostroventrolateral medulla." J Auton Nerv Syst 76(2-3): 127-134.

	In the present study, renal sympathetic nerve activity was recorded simultaneously with sympathetic nerve activity to skeletal muscle vasculature to determine if the sympatho-inhibition evoked by microinjection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)teralin (8-OH-DPAT) into the rostroventrolateral medulla (RVLM) was uniform or regional. Three patterns of sympatho-inhibition were observed in these sympathetic outflows and the type of response depended upon location of microinjection within the subretrofacial nucleus (SRF). Inhibition of renal nerve activity only was elicited by microinjections at rostral sites at the caudal pole of the facial nucleus. In contrast, inhibition of muscle sympathetic nerve activity was evoked from more caudal injections at the rostral pole of the inferior olives. Microinjection in the area between these two regions produced inhibition of both sympathetic outflows. This study demonstrates that differential inhibition of regional sympathetic outflows can be elicited by microinjection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT into the RVLM. These data suggests that this modulation is due to differences in anatomical arrangement of the medullary neurons rather than differences in neuron sensitivity to the serotonergic agonist.
