Wolf, A., et al. (1998). "Facilitation of female rat lordosis behavior by hypothalamic infusion of 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists." Brain Res 779(1-2): 84-95.

	Ovariectomized rats were hormonally primed with 0.5 mu g estradiol benzoate and 500 mu g progesterone to produce two groups of rats differing in their lordosis behavior. Females with a lordosis to mount (L/M) ratio < 0.5 were used to test the hypothesis that 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists could facilitate lordosis behavior. Females with L/M ratios greater than or equal to 0.5 were used to evaluate the potential suppressive effect of 5-HT2A/2C receptor compounds. Lordosis behavior was examined following bilateral infusion of drugs into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN). Drugs examined were the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist, (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane pane HCl (DOI), the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, 3-[2-[4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperdinyl]ethyl]-2,4(1H,3H)-quinazolinedione tartrate (ketanserin tartrate), and the non-selective 5-HT receptor agents, 2-(1-piperazinyl)quinoline dimaleate (quipazine) and N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine HCl (TFMPP). Drugs with agonist action at 5-HT2A/2C receptors increased lordosis behavior in rats with low sexual receptivity. The 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, ketanserin, inhibited lordosis behavior in sexually receptive rats. DOI attenuated the lordosis-inhibiting effect of ketanserin, but ketanserin was less effective in preventing DOI from increasing lordosis behavior. These results strengthen prior inferences that activation of 5-HT2A/2C receptors can facilitate lordosis behavior and that the VMN is one site at which such facilitation can occur.
