	Serotonin 5-HT1A receptors have been implicated in disorders of the central nervous system and, therefore, are being studied by PET. Efforts are under way to improve in vivo stability of 5-HT1A agents currently in human use (C-11-labeled N-(2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1 -piperazinyl]ethyl-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide [C-11-WAY-100635], 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2" -pyridinyl)-p- F-18-fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine [F-18-MPPF], and F-18-labeled trans-4-fluoro-N-(2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl]N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide [F-18-FCWAY]). We have synthesized N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]ethyll}-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(4-F-18-fluoromethylcyclohexane)carboxamide (F-18-mefway), which contains a F-18 on a primary carbon to make the compound more stable to defluorination. Methods: Radiosynthesis of F-18-mefway was performed in a single tosylate for F-18-fluoride exchange. In vitro binding studies on rat brain slices using F-18-mefway were read on a phosphor imager. Monkey PET studies were performed on a whole-body PET scanner. Results: Binding affinity (inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC50]) of mefway was 26 nmol/L and was comparable to that of WAY-100635,23 nmol/L. Yields of F-18-mefway were 20%-30% in specific activities of 74-111 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis. In vitro binding of F-18-mefway in the hippocampus (Hp), colliculus (Co), cortex (Ctx), and other brain regions-with limited binding in the cerebellum (Cer)-was observed, with ratios of Hp/Cer = 82.3, Co/Cer = 45.8, and Ctx/Cer = 40. Serotonin displaced F-18-mefway from various brain regions with IC50 values in the range of 169-243 nmol/L. PET studies in a rhesus monkey showed F-18-mefway binding in the fontal cortex (FC), temporal cortex (TC) including hippocampus, raphe (Rp), and other brain regions, with ratios of FC/Cer = 9.0, TC/Cer = 10, and Rp/Cer = 3.3. Plasma analysis indicated the presence of approximately 30% of 18F-mefway at 150-180 min after injection. Conclusion: The high ratios in specific brain regions such as the hippocampus suggest that F-18-mefway has potential as a PET agent for 5HT(1A) receptors.
