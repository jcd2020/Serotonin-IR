Guilbaud, G., et al. (1989). "Evidence for peripheral serotonergic mechanisms in the early sensitization after carrageenin-induced inflammation: electrophysiological studies in the ventrobasal complex of the rat thalamus using a potent specific antagonist of peripheral 5-HT receptors." Brain Res 502(1): 187-197.

	The effect of ICS 205-930 (ICS), a specific 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, was analyzed on the sensitization of ventrobasal (VB) thalamic neuronal responses produced by an intraplantar injection of carrageenin. ICS was injected locally in the plantar paw, simultaneously, or after carrageenin (at 20 min or later than 70 min). The progressive increase of the VB neuronal responses to pinch (total number of spikes in the discharge) due to carrageenin sensitization, was prevented, blocked, or reversed, by intraplantar ICS, at a dose as low as 3.2 ng/kg, when injected, simultaneously or in the first half-hour following the carrageenin injection itself. The carrageenin sensitization then reappeared, 50-90 min after the initiation of the inflammation. By contrast to these early injections of ICS, a later administration of ICS (70 min or more, after the carrageenin injection), did not influence the sensitization. The time course of the effects of this 5-HT3 antagonist receptor agrees well with the time course of 5-HT release into the inflammatory exudate. These data, and those previously reported on the action of aspirin and of a peripheral antihistamine on carrageenin sensitization, are compared. These results indicate the relative participation of the various inflammatory substances released in the exudate, and the importance of timing of administration for an effective antagonism of the hyperalgesia elicited by this inflammation.
