	Prolactin secretion is controlled by the hypothalamus through different neurotransmitters which interact with multiple receptor subtypes. The discovery of different families of receptors for serotonin (5-HT1-5-HT7) and excitatory aminoacids (NMDA, KA, AMPA and metabotropic receptors) ilustrates the complexity of this regulation. Moreover, in the rat the role of different neurotransmitters changes during pubertal development. Present experiments were carried out to analyse the interactions between AMPA and serotoninergic receptors in the control of prolactin secretion in prepubertal male rats. For this purpose, 16 and 23-day old male rats were treated with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP, precursor of serotonin synthesis) plus fluoxetine (blocker of serotonin reuptake), 8-OH-DPAT (agonist of 5-HT1A receptors), DOI and alpha-Me-5-HT (agonists of 5-HT2 receptors), 1-phenylbiguanide (agonist of 5-HT3 receptors) alone or in combination with AMPA (agonist of AMPA receptors). The results obtained indicate that: (a) activation of 5-HT1A receptors stimulated PRL secretion on day 16 and inhibited it on day 23; activation of 5-HT2 receptors stimulated PRL secretion on days 16 and 23, whereas activation of 5-HT3 receptors inhibited PRL release only on day 23; (b) activation of AMPA receptors inhibited PRL secretion on day 23, but not on day 16 and (c) a cross-talk is apparent between 5-HT2 and AMPA receptors in the regulation of PRL secretion, the stimulatory effect of DOI being blocked by AMPA.
