Tokarski, K., et al. (2011). "THE 5-HT7 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST SB 269970 COUNTERACTS RESTRAINT STRESS-INDUCED ATTENUATION OF LONG-TERM POTENTIATION IN RAT FRONTAL CORTEX." Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 62(6): 663-667.

	The effects of restraint lasting for 10 min, repeated twice daily for 3 days, were studied ex vivo in rat frontal cortex slices prepared 24 h after the last stress session. In slices originating from stressed animals, the amplitude of extracellular field potentials recorded in cortical layer II/III was increased. Stress also resulted in a reduced magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) of field potentials. In a separate experimental group, rats were subjected to restraint lasting for 10 min, twice daily for 3 days but, additionally, animals received injections of 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB 269970 (1.25 mg/kg) before each restraint stress session. In this group, the amplitude of field potentials and the magnitude of LIP were not different from the control, indicating that stress-induced modifications of basal glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity were prevented by the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist.
