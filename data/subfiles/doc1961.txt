	Dopamine (DA) profoundly modulates excitatory synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in the brain. In the present study the effects of SKF83959, the selective agonist of phosphatidylinositol (PI)-linked D-1-like receptor, on the excitatory synaptic transmission were investigated in rat hippocampus. SKF83959 (10-100 mu M) reversibly suppressed the field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) elicited by stimulating the Schaffer's collateral-commissural fibers in CA1 area of hippocampal slices. However, the inhibition was not blocked by the D-1 receptor antagonist SCH23390, the D-2 receptor antagonist raclopride, the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist mesulergine, or the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin. In addition, SKF83959 inhibited the afferent volley and significantly reduced the paired-pulse facilitation ratios. In dissociated hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, SKF83959 had no detectable effect on glutamate-induced currents but potently inhibited voltage-activated Na+ current (IC50 value = 26.9 +/- 1.0 mu M), which was not blocked by SCH23390 or by intracellular dialysis of GDP-beta-S. These results demonstrate that SKF83959 suppressed the excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal CA1 area, which was independent of D-1-like receptor. The mechanism underlying the effect could be mainly inhibition of Na+ channel in the afferent fibers. The suppression of excitatory synaptic transmission and the Na+ channel by SKF83959 may contribute to its therapeutic benefits in Parkinson's disease. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
