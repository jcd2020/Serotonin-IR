	It is a common belief that male aggressive and sexual behaviour share many of the underlying neurobiological, neurological, pharmacological and neuroendocrine mechanisms. Therefore, we studied brain activation patterns in male rat after performance of aggressive and sexual behaviour and compared serotonergic pharmacology in the same paradigms to delineate possible similarities and differences. Patterns of Fos-immunoreactivity induced by aggressive and sexual encounters of Wild-type male Brown Norway rats were studied to localise the commonly activated (functionally shared) parts of the circuitry, and the specific (functionally different) parts of the neuronal circuitry. Some brain areas (caudal medial preoptic area and medial amygdala) were commonly activated, but other areas (e.g. posterodorsal parts of the medial amygdala, rostral preoptic and premammillary hypothalamus) showed remarkably specific differences in neural activation. 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists inhibit aggressive, but stimulate male sexual behaviour, whereas 5-HT(1B) receptor agonists inhibit both types of behaviour. Selective scrotonin reuptake inhibitors share comparable inhibitory effects in aggression and sexual behaviour, although only at relatively high doses. We propose that separate hard-wired neural systems exist in the brain for aggressive and sexual behaviours, modulated via hierarchically 'higher-level' brain areas that are involved in the integration (gating) of the behavioural outcome of an organism.
