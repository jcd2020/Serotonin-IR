Millan, M. J., et al. (1992). "S 14671: a naphtylpiperazine 5-hydroxytryptamine1A agonist of exceptional potency and high efficacy possessing antagonist activity at 5-hydroxytryptamine1C/2 receptors." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 262(2): 451-463.

	The interaction at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors of the novel naphtylpiperazine, S 14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoylamino)ethyl]-4[1-(7- methoxynaphtyl)]piperazine), was compared to that of the 5-HT1A ligands, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT), WY 50,324 [N-(29(4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)tricyclo(3.3.1.1(3,7) )- decane-1-carboxamide], (+)-flesinoxan, buspirone and BMY 7378 [(8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- 1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspirol[-4-]-decane-7,9-dione 2HCl]. S 14671 showed a very high affinity for 5-HT1A sites (pKi, 9.3) as compared to the reference ligands (pKi values, 9.2, 8.7, 8.7, 7.9 and 8.7, respectively). S 14671 bound in an apparently competitive manner and, in distinction to the reference compounds, possessed a Hill Coefficient (1.4) significantly superior to 1. Although showing low affinity at 5-HT1B and 5-HT3 sites, S 14671 displayed significant affinity at both 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites; pKi, 7.8 in each case. Furthermore, S 14671 acted as an antagonist of 5-HT-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover in rat choroid plexus (5-HT1C) and cortex (5-HT2). In vivo, upon s.c. administration, S 14671 acted as a high efficacy agonist in models of 5-HT1A receptor-mediated activity: induction of flat-body posture, spontaneous tail-flicks, hypothermia and corticosterone secretion and inhibition of morphine-induced antinociception. In every test, S 14671 was the most potent compound: it was active at doses as low as 5 micrograms/kg s.c. Relative potency across all tests was S 14671 greater than 8-OH-DPAT greater than WY 50,324 greater than (+)-flesinoxan greater than buspirone with BMY 7378 too weak for comparison to be meaningful. The action of S 14671 in 5-HT1A tests was blocked by BMY 7378 and the 5-HT1A antagonist, (-)-alprenolol, but unaffected by the 5-HT1C/2 antagonist, ritanserin, and the 5-HT3 antagonist, ondansetron. Activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors was confirmed in 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-lesioned rats, in which the potency of S 14671 to elicit spontaneous tail-flicks was potentiated. Activation of presynaptic receptors was demonstrated by inhibition of the electrical activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus with the following order of relative potency: S 14671 greater than 8-OH-DPAT greater than WY 50,324 greater than BMY 7378 greater than buspirone. Spiperone, which acts as a pure 5-HT1A antagonist at raphe 5-HT1A receptors, blocked the action of S 14671. In conclusion, S 14671 is a structurally novel ligand manifesting high efficacy and exceptional potency at both pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
