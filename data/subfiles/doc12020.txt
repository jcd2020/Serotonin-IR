Yamaguchi, T., et al. (1997). "Facilitation of acetylcholine release in rat frontal cortex by indeloxazine hydrochloride: involvement of endogenous serotonin and 5-HT4 receptors." Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archives of Pharmacology 356(6): 712-720.

	Effects of indeloxazine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) reuptake with a facilitatory effect on 5-HT release, on acetylcholine (ACh) output-in frontal cortex of conscious rats were characterized using an in vivo microdialysis technique. Systemic administration of indeloxazine (3 and 10 mg/kg, i.p.) increased ACh and 5-HT output in a dose-dependent manner Depletion of endogenous monoamines by reserpine and of 5-HT by p-chlorophenylalanine, but not that of catecholamines by alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine, significantly attenuated the facilitatory effect of indeloxazine on ACh release. When applied locally by reverse dialysis, indeloxazine (10 and 30 mu M) and the selective 5-HT reuptake Inhibitor citalopram (10 mu M), but not the NE reuptake Inhibitor maprotiline (30 mu M), increased cortical ACh output. Indeloxazine (10 mg/kg)-induced increase in ACh release was significantly inhibited by local appreciation of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonists RS23597 (50 mu M) and GR113803 (1 mu M), while the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100135 (100 mu M), 5-HT1A/1B/beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)propranolol (150 mu M), 5-HT2A/2C, antagonist ritanserin (10 mu M) and 5-MT3 antagonist ondansetron (10 mu M) failed to significantly modify this effect. Neither depletion of monoamines nor treatment with serotonergic antagonists significantly changed the basal ACh level, indicating that endogenous monoamines do not tonically activate ACh release. These results suggest that indeloxazine-induced facilitation of ACh release in rat frontal cortex is mediated by endogenous 5-HT and involves at least in part cortical 5-HT4 receptors.
