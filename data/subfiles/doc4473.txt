	The dual serotonin (5-HT) re-uptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor agonist vilazodone was found to increase central serotonin levels in rat brain. In the course of structural modifications of vilazodone 3-{4-[4-(2-oxo-2H-1-benzopyran-6-yl)-1-piperazinyl]-butyl}-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile 8i and its fluorine analogue 6-{4-[4-(5-fluor-3-indolyl)-butyl]-1-piperazinyl}-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one have been identified. These unsubstituted chromenones are equally potent at the 5-HT1A receptor and 5-HT transporter. The implementation of nitrogen functionalities in position 3 of the chromenones resulted in compounds acting as agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor and as 5-HT re-uptake inhibitors like vilazodone. Ex vivo 5-HT re-uptake inhibition and in vitro 5-HT agonism were determined in the PCA- and GTRgammaS-assay, respectively. The potential of these chromenones to increase central 5-HT levels was measured in microdialysis studies and especially the derivatives 3-{4-[4-(3-amino-2-oxo-2H-chromen-6-yl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile 8f, ethyl (6-{4-[4-(5-cyano-1H-indol-3-yl)-butyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-carbamate 8h and N-(6-{4-[4-(5-cyano-1H-indol-3-yl)-butyl]-piperazin-1-yl}-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)-acetamide 8k give rise to rapid development of increased serotonin levels in rat brain cortex, lasting longer than 3h.
