	Valeriana adscendens Trel. (Valerianaceae) is a psychoactive plant usually used in magical-therapeutic rituals in traditional practices of the Northern Peruvian Andes. Previous studies have been carried out on extracts of aerial parts in order to validate its traditional use. The results indicated that Valeriana adscendens exerts important effects on the central nervous system. Aim of the present study is to evaluate if the effects on the central nervous system of Valeriana adscendens extracts can be associated with interaction with some CNS receptors. In this work we examined affinity and selectivity of two Valeriana adscendens extracts (methanolic and aqueous) towards 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C) serotononergic, D(1) and D(2) dopaminergic, alpha(1) and alpha(2) noradrenergic receptors by a preliminary binding screen. The results show weak affinity to 5-HT(1A) for the aqueous extract. Both extracts showed affinity for D(1) receptors, but only for the methanolic extract the IC(50) value was determinable (30.14 microg/ml). No affinity for 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C) serotononergic receptors, alpha(1) and alpha(2) noradrenergic receptors and D(2) receptors was recorded for the extracts.
