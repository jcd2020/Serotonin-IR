	Background Although 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) has been implicated in mania, the precise alterations in the S-HT system remain elusive. Aims To assess brain 5-HT(2) receptors in drug-free individuals experiencing a manic episode in comparison with healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography (PET). Method Participants (n = 10) with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder - manic episode and healthy controls (n = 10) underwent [(18)F]setoperone scans. The differences in 5-HT(2) receptor binding potential between the two groups were determined using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis. Results Age was a significant correlate with 5-HT(2) receptor binding potential with a similar magnitude of correlation in both groups. The SPM analysis with age as a covarlate showed that the individuals with current mania had significantly lower 5-HT(2) receptor binding potential in frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortical regions, with changes more prominent in the right cortical regions compared with controls. Conclusions This study suggests that brain 5-HT(2) receptors are decreased in people with acute mania.
