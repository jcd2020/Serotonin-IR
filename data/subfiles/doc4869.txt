Huang, X. M., et al. (1994). "DRUG DISCRIMINATION AND RECEPTOR-BINDING STUDIES OF N-ISOPROPYL LYSERGAMIDE DERIVATIVES." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 47(3): 667-673.

	N-Isopropyl (IPLA), N-methyl-N-isopropyl (MIPLA), N-ethyl-N-isopropyl (EIPLA), and N,N-diisopropyl (DIPLA) lysergamides were evaluated for lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-like activity. In rats trained to discriminate 0.08 mg/kg LSD tartrate from saline, each of the subject compounds completely substituted, with an ED(50) two to three times larger than that of LSD except for DIPLA, which had an ED(50) about eightfold greater. Similarly, all the compounds displaced [I-125](R)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane ([I-125]DOI) from rat cortical homogenates and displaced [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-npropylamino)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT) from rat hippocampal homogenates with K-I values similar to those of LSD, again with the exception of DIPLA. which had about nine- and fourfold lower affinities, respectively. Interestingly, all the compounds had four- to fivefold lower affinities than LSD in displacing [H-3]ketanserin from 5-HT2 binding sites. Molecular modeling studies found that all the compounds had low energy conformations similar to LSD. No correlation between the activity of the compounds and the preferred conformation of the amide substituents was apparent. In summary, N-alkyl-Nisopropyl analogs of LSD retain LSD-like activity in drug discrimination and 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 agonist binding assays only until the N-alkyl substitution is as large as ethyl; LSD-like activity dramatically drops when the second alkyl substituent is N-isopropyl.
