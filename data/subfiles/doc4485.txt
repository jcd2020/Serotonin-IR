Gorzalka, B. B. and L. A. Hanson (1998). "Sexual behavior and wet dog shakes in the male rat: regulation by corticosterone." Behav Brain Res 97(1-2): 143-151.

	The potential involvement of adrenal steroids in the regulation of 'wet dog shakes' (WDS) and sexual behavior was investigated in male rats treated or not with the serotonergic type 2A (5-HT2A) agonist DOI (5-HT2A receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane). In Experiment 1, the frequency of both spontaneous and DOI-induced WDS were compared in adrenalectomized and sham-adrenalectomized rats. Adrenalectomy significantly reduced the frequency of DOI-induced WDS. In Experiment 2, adrenalectomized and sham-adrenalectomized rats received either corticosterone or oil chronically and were again scored for WDS behavior. Corticosterone effectively blocked the adrenalectomy-induced reduction of WDS in the DOI treatment condition. In Experiment 3, intact male rats were chronically administered either corticosterone or oil treatment. Animals were then compared on measures of both spontaneous and DOI-induced WDS and sexual behavior. Corticosterone significantly increased WDS and inhibited sexual behavior in both the spontaneous and DOI treatment conditions. These results suggest that the adrenal steroid corticosterone is important in the regulation of WDS and sexual behavior in the male rat and that this regulation may be mediated by activity at 5-HT2A receptors.
