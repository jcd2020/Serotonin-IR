	In the present study, we tried to find out whether the expression of c-Fos proteins induced by DOI, an agonist of 5-HT2A/2C receptor subtypes is colocalized with 5-HT2A receptor protein in cortical neurons. 5-HT2A receptor protein was found in two major neuronal elements: dendritic processes (seen in layers II/III-V) and less abundantly in cell bodies (layer V). In our experiment, DOI (8 mg/kg) induced a robust appearance of c-Fos proteins mainly in neuronal nuclei of the upper part of layer V/IV, and a moderate amount of sparsely distributed nuclei in deep cortical layers (V and VI). It was found that c-Fos proteins never occurred in cortical neurons, which were immunopositive for the presence of 5-HT2A receptor protein. It is concluded that the induction of c-Fos proteins expression by DOI though initiated by activation of 5-HT2A receptors, requires the involvement of intermediate neurotransmitter(s). Additionally, our study indicates that the appearance of DOI-induced c-Fos proteins cannot be used as a simple and direct marker of localization and site of activation of 5-HT2A receptors.
