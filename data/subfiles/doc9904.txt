	In this study, the antidepressant-like effect caused by diphenyl diselenide on rat forced swimming test (FST) was investigated. The involvement of the monoaminergic system in the antidepressant-like effect was also evaluated. Diphenyl diselenide (0.1-30 mg/kg), given by oral route (p.o.), 30 min earlier, reduced the immobility time in the FST, without accompanying changes in ambulation when assessed in an open field. The anti-immobility effect of diphenyl diselenide (1 mg/kg, p.o.) on the FST was prevented by pretreatment of rats with p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA; 100 mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, given once a day, for 3 consecutive days), WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist), ketanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(2A)/(2C) receptor antagonist), ondasentron (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist), haloperidol (1 mg/kg, i.p., a D(1), D(2) and D(3) receptor antagonist), SCH233390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., a D(1) receptor antagonist), sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p., a D(2) receptor antagonist), prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), yohimbine (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist). However, the anti-immobility effect caused by diphenyl diselenide (1 mg/kg, p.o.) on the FST was not affected by pretreatment with propanolol (2 mg/kg, i.p., a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist). Furthermore, monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity was inhibited (39%) in the animals treated with diphenyl diselenide (30 mg/kg, p.o.) when compared to the control group. Taken together these data demonstrated that the antidepressant-like effect caused by diphenyl diselenide seems to be mediated by involvement of the central monoaminergic system.
