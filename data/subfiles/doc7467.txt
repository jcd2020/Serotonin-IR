	Buspirone (busp) a piperazinyl derivative with anxiolytic properties is a partial agonist on 5-HT1A with affinity for D2-like dopaminergic receptors (RD2). The objective of this study was to verify the effects of busp on RD2. Female Wistar rats 150-200 g were treated with busp (5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) 1 or 2 times daily for 7 days. Controls (C) received saline. The density of RD2 (fmol/mg protein) was determined through binding assays in striatum (ST) using [3H]-spiroperidol as radioligand. No alteration in Bmax or Kd values were seen after busp administration once a day. However, a RD2 upregulation of 55 % increase was observed after busp 2 times a day with no change in Kd values. The results showed that busp interact not only with serotonergic, but also with dopaminergic system.
