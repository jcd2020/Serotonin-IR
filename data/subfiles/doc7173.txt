	Serotonergic genes have been implicated in mood disorders, alcoholism and certain personality traits. We investigated the possible relationship between several polymorphisms in the serotonin (5-HT) system and amygdala responses to negative facial stimuli in Korean women using functional magnetic resonance imaging. All participants were genotyped with regard to the following polymorphisms: the serotonin transporter-gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) G(-703)T, 5-HT(1A) C(-1019)G and 5-HT(2A) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6311. We found increased activations in response to angry facial stimuli in the bilateral amygdala of subjects with the long allele of 5-HTTLPR compared with those with two copies of the short allele. Higher activations in response to sad facial stimuli were found in the bilateral amygdala of subjects with the T/T genotype of 5-HT(2A) SNP rs6311, compared with C allele carriers, and in subjects with the G/G genotype of TPH2 G(-703)T, compared with those with T/T and G/T genotypes. Our results for individuals from an Asian population countered a previous finding for a Caucasian population and identified the moderating role of genetic background in the relationships between these serotonergic gene polymorphisms and amygdala function elicited by negative emotional stimuli.
