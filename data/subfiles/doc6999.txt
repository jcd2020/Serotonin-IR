Martin, K. F., et al. (1992). "CHARACTERIZATION OF 8-OH-DPAT-INDUCED HYPOTHERMIA IN MICE AS A 5-HT1A AUTORECEPTOR RESPONSE AND ITS EVALUATION AS A MODEL TO SELECTIVELY IDENTIFY ANTIDEPRESSANTS." British Journal of Pharmacology 107(1): 15-21.

	1 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) dose-dependently induced hypothermia in mice. 2 The 5-HT1A receptor partial agonists, buspirone, gepirone and ipsapirone, also dose-dependently induced hypothermia. 3 The 8-OH-DPAT temperature response was antagonized by the 5-HT1 receptor antagonists quipazine (2 mg kg-1, i.p.), (+/-)-propranolol (10 mg kg-1, i.p.). (+/-)-pindolol (5 mg kg-1, i.p.), spiroxatrine (0.5 mg kg-1, i.p.) and metitepine (0.05 mg kg-1, i.p.), but not by 5-HT2 (ketanserin) or 5-HT3 (MDL 72222, GR 38032F) receptor antagonists. 4 The response was also antagonized by the dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, haloperidol and BRL 34778. No other catecholamine or muscarinic receptors were involved in mediating the response. 5 Destruction of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-containing neurones with the neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (75-mu-g, i.c.v.), abolished the response to 8-OH-DPAT indicating that the 5-HT1A receptors involved were located on 5-HT neurones. 6 Chronic antidepressant treatment down-regulated this 8-OH-DPAT response. In addition, chronic administration of anxiolytics and neuroleptics was also effective in this respect. Down-regulation was also observed following repeated administration of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg kg-1, s.c.), (+/-)-pindolol (10 mg kg-1, i.p.) and ketanserin (0.5 mg kg-1, i.p.). 7 In conclusion, these data confirm that 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia is mediated by 5-HT1A autoreceptors. They also indicate that the response involves D2 receptors. The present study also shows that a wide range of antidepressant drugs down-regulate this response although this property is not restricted to antidepressant treatments. Therefore, care should be exercised when interpreting data from this paradigm.
