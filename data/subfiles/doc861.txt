"Effects of the potential antidepressant OPC-14523 1- 3- 4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl propyl -5-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2- quinolinone monomethanesulfonate a combined sigma and 5-HT1A ligand: Modulation of neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 310(2): 578-583.

	OPC-14523 (OPC; [1-[3-[4-(3- Chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl] propyl]5- methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2-quinolinone monomethanesulfonate)] is a novel compound with high affinity for sigma and 5-HT1A receptors as well as for the 5- HT transporter. OPC has previously been shown to produce antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression. This project set out to determine the effect of OPC on serotonergic neurotransmission and to shed light on its mechanism( s) of action. In an electrophysiological model of in vivo extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats, a 2-day treatment ( 1 mg/kg/day) with OPC induced a significant increase in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) putative 5- HT neurons' firing activity. This increase was blocked by the coadministration of NE-100 [N,N-dipropyl-2-(4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy) phenyl)-thylamine], a selective sigma(1) antagonist ( 10 mg/kg/day). Furthermore, after 2-day treatments with OPC, the 5- HT1A autoreceptor response was altered, as demonstrated by the dramatically reduced response to an increase of endogenous 5- HT induced by the acute administration of paroxetine ( 500 mug/kg, i.v.). However, the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(dinpropylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) ( 4 mug/kg, i.v.) maintained its ability to decrease 5-HT firing activity, an effect that was reversible by the subsequent administration of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 [N-[2-(4-[2-methoxyphenyl]-1-piperazinyl) ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide] (100 mug/kg, i.v.). As 8-OH-DPAT has been shown to act preferentially through postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, our data suggests that this effect of OPC is mediated primarily by the 5-HT1A autoreceptor. The decreased response of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor to paroxetine was not blocked by the coadministration of NE-100 indicating that sigma(1) receptors are not involved in this effect. Thus, both sigma and 5-HT1A receptors play a role in the "antidepressant-like" effects produced by OPC, which is in keeping with previously published behavioral data. In addition, the current series of experiments suggest that OPC might have potential as an antidepressant with a rapid onset of action compared with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatments, which initially suppress the firing activity of putative 5-HT neurons and require at least 2 to 3 weeks to restore the firing activity to baseline neuronal firing activity through a desensitization of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor.
