	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is one of the most important neuromediator involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. In addition it is well established that 5-HT acts as a growth factor on several types of non-tumoral and tumoral cells, and recently it was also related to oncogenes. 5-HT(1A) receptor expression was identified in prostatic tumor cell lines (PD cells) and in human hormone refractory prostate cancer tissue. Based on these observations, development of 5-HT(1A) antagonists could be useful in inhibiting the growth of cancer cells. In order to investigate on potential use of 5-HT(1A) ligands as antiproliferative agents, we have analyzed a new set of 1-naphtylpiperazine derivatives. In binding studies, several molecules showed affinity in nanomolar and subnanomolar range at 5-HT(1A) and moderate to no affinity for other relevant receptors (5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C), D(1), D(2), alpha(1) and alpha(2)). All compounds were then evaluated in order to assess their antiproliferative activity using PC3 cells and the most active compounds (1 and 2) were fully characterized to define the mechanism responsible for the observed antiproliferative effect.
