Stone, E. A., et al. (1997). "Activation of fos in mouse amygdala by local infusion of norepinephrine or atipamezole." Brain Research 778(1): 1-5.

	Norepinephrine (NE) is known to activate a number of immediate-early genes (IEGs) in the brain which map be involved in prolonged changes in neuronal function. To investigate the function of these genes it would be useful to have a model system in which they are induced in specific populations of cells in specific brain regions without systemic drug administration which can affect multiple sites. Tn the present paper we have shown that local infusions of NE or of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, atipamezole, in the mouse amygdala produces localized expression of fos. The expression of fos was blocked by a cocktail of an alpha(1)- (prazosin) and beta(1)-adrenoceptor (betaxolol) blocker but not by a selective 5-HT1A blocker (WAY100135). Prazosin and betaxolol did not have a nonspecific reducing action on fos expression. It is concluded that localized expression of fos after NE infusion in the mouse amygdala represents a model system for further studies of the role of IEG expression in central noradrenergic function.
