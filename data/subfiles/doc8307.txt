	The anti-hypertensive drug ifenprodil is known to interact potently with the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor as well as a number of other second messenger-linked receptors. In addition to these properties, ifenprodil has been shown to prevent glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity via non-competitive antagonism of NMDA receptors [Legendre and Westbrook (1991) Molec. Pharmac. 40: 289-298; Shalaby et al. (1992) J. Pharmac. Exp. Ther. 260: 925-932]. With these things in mind, we have begun to examine the specificity of ifenprodil for various ligand-gated ion channels using electrophysiological methods. While ifenprodil effectively inhibits NMDA-mediated currents in cortical neurons in culture, it does not interact with either kainate or GABA receptors. Surprisingly, ifenprodil also acts as a relatively potent antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor in the NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cell line. Furthermore, several aspects of ifenprodil action on the 5-HT3 receptor resemble its interaction with the NMDA receptor. Namely, inhibition of 5-HT3-mediated cation currents is readily reversible, has relatively slow onset, is non-competitive, and is not voltage dependent. Since most of the known 5-HT3 antagonists are competitive, it is possible that ifenprodil may define a unique modulatory site(s) on this neurotransmitter receptor.
