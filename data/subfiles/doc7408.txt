	No other drug has been associated with aggressive and violent behavior more than alcohol has. A major characteristic of the link between alcohol and social interactions is the very large variation in who becomes more aggressive while drinking and who does not. Tracing the origins of these individual differences has led to a focus on predispositions, such as the antisocial behavior of Type 2 alcoholics. Successful development of an experimental procedure to model heightened aggressive behavior after voluntary consumption of alcohol has facilitated the neurobiologic analysis of the link between alcohol and aggression. From a pharmacologic perspective, consumption of low to moderate doses of alcohol engenders heightened aggressive behavior in a significant minority of individuals before the circulation of appreciable amounts of the aldehyde metabolite. Ionophoric receptors such as NMDA, 5-HT(3) and GABA(A) have been identified in the brain as major sites of action for alcohol in the dose range that is relevant for engendering heightened aggression. Actions at the GABA(A) receptor complex that depend on particular GABA(A) subunits appear to be necessary for alcohol-heightened aggression. Genes that encode the synthesis of these alpha and gamma subunits are potentially significant markers for those individuals that are prone to engage in heightened aggressive behavior after the consumption of alcohol. Of particular importance are the reciprocal interactions between GABA and serotonin. Activating specific serotonin receptor subtypes such as 5-HT(1B) receptors reduces alcohol-heightened aggressive behavior. How these GABAergic and serotonergic corticolimbic mechanisms for alcohol-heightened aggression develop during the adolescent period remains an area of urgent study.
