	[F-18]Mefway was developed to provide an F-18 labeled positron emission tomography (PET) neuroligand with high affinity for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor to improve the in vivo assessment of the 5-HT1A system. The goal of this work was to compare the in vivo kinetics of [F-18]mefway, [F-18]MPPF, and [C-11]WAY100635 in the rhesus monkey. Methods: Each of four monkeys were given bolus injections of [F-18] mefway, [C-11]WAY100635, and [F-18]MPPF and scans were acquired with a micro-PET P4 scanner. Arterial blood was sampled to assay parent compound throughout the time course of the PET experiment. Time activity curves were extracted in the high 5-HT1A binding areas of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACG), mesial temporal cortex, raphe nuclei, and insula cortex. Time activity curves were also extracted in the cerebellum, which was used as a reference region. The in vivo kinetics of the radiotracers were compared based on the nondisplaceable distribution volume (V-ND) and binding potential (BPND). Results: At 30 min, the fraction of radioactivity in the plasma due to parent compound was 19%, 28%, and 29% and cleared from the arterial plasma at rates of 0.0031, 0.0078, and 0.0069 (min(-1)) ([F-18]mefway, [F-18]MPPF, [C-11]WAY100635). The BPND in the brain regions were mesial temporal cortex: 7.4 +/- 0.6, 3.1 +/- 0.4, 7.0 +/- 1.2, ACG: 7.2 +/- 1.2, 2.1 +/- 0.2, 7.9 +/- 1.2; raphe nuclei: 3.7 +/- 0.6, 1.3 +/- 0.3, 3.3 +/- 0.7; and insula cortex: 4.2 +/- 0.6, 1.2 +/- 0.1, 4.7 +/- 1.0 for [F-18] mefway, [F-18] MPPF, and [C-11] WAY100635 respectively. Conclusions: In the rhesus monkey, [F-18] mefway has similar in vivo kinetics to [C-11]WAY100635 and yields greater than 2-fold higher BPND than [F-18] MPPF. These properties make [F-18] mefway a promising radiotracer for 5-HT1A assay, providing higher counting statistics and a greater dynamic range in BPND. Synapse 65: 592-600, 2011.
