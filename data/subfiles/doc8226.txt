	The basal ganglia in the brain contains glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, CCK, adenosine, opioid, cannabinoid, etc. These agents contribute to keep motor control and modulation of the agent may be a cue to the treatment of movement disorders. D1 or D2 dopamine receptor agonists increase locomotor activity in MPTP-treated common marmosets which showed decreased locomotor activity and decreased number of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. Using this model of parkinsonism, NMDA receptor antag-onists, antimuscarinic receptor antagonists, 5-HT1A receptor agonists, adenosine receptor antagonists were showed to reverse the impaired movement of the model animals. The results may contribute to the development of new drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
