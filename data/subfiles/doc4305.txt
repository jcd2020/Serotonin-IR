	While dopaminergic, noradrenergic, cholinergic and gabaergic effects on the P300 component of the human event-related brain potential have been largely described, little is known about serotonergic influence. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between P300 and serotonergic activity as reflected by prolactin (PRL) response to flesinoxan, a 5-HT1A full agonist, among 28 normal subjects. Results showed a significant negative correlation between P300 amplitude and PRL response to flesinoxan (r = 0.47, p = 0.01 at Cz; r = -0.45, p = 0.01 at Pz). In contrast, both P300 latency and reaction time were not related to endocrine response. This study supports a role for serotonin in the neurobiological modulation of P300 amplitude. Clinical implications of these results are considered. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
