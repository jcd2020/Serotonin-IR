	N-G-Nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, induces catalepsy in mice. The objective of the present work was to investigate if serotonergic drugs are able to modulate this effect. Results showed that the cataleptogenic effect of L-NOARG (40 mg/kg) in male albino-Swiss mice was enhanced by pre-treatment with (+)-N-tert-butyl-3-(4-[2-methoxyphenyl]piperazin-1-yl)-2- phenylprapanamide ((+)-WAY-100135, 5 or 10 mg/kg), a 5-HT1A-selective receptor antagonist, and by ketanserin (5 or 10 mg/kg), a 5-HT2A receptor and alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist. Prazosin (3 or 5 mg/kg), an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, and endo-N-(8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2. 1]oct-3yl)-2,3-dihydro-3,3-dimethyl-indole-1-carobxamide HCl (BRL-46470A, 0.05 or 0.5 mg/kg), a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, did not interfere with L-NOARG-induced catalepsy. Ritanserin (3 or 10 mg/kg), a 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, tended to enhance the effect of L-NOARG. These results confirm that interference with the formation of nitric oxide induces catalepsy in mice, and suggest that this effect is modulated by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors.
