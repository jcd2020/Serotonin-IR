Ootsuka, Y., et al. (2004). "Spinal 5-HT2A receptors regulate cutaneous sympathetic vasomotor outflow in rabbits and rats; relevance for cutaneous vasoconstriction elicited by MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, "Ecstasy") and its reversal by clozapine." Brain Res 1014(1-2): 34-44.

	We determined whether spinal 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptors contribute to resting cutaneous sympathetic vasomotor activity, and to increases in activity elicited by electrical stimulation of the medullary raphe/parapyramidal region, and whether these receptors are involved in the cutaneous vasoconstricting action of systemically administered MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, "Ecstasy") and its reversal by clozapine. Experiments were conducted in urethane-anesthetized rabbits and rats. Administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist, trans-4-((3Z)3-[(2-Dimethylaminoethyl)oxyimino]-3-(2-fluorophenyl)propen-1-yl)-phenol, hemifumarate (SR 46349B, 0.1 mg/kg, i.v.) inhibited resting ear pinna sympathetic vasomotor nerve discharge and reduced the extent to which raphe/parapyramidal electrical stimulation caused ear pinna (rabbit) and tail (rat) artery blood flow to fall. Clozapine (0.125-0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) also reduced the fall in ear pinna blood flow elicited by raphe/parapyramidal stimulation. In rabbits, after inactivation of raphe/parapyramidal function by local microinjection of muscimol (1 nmol in 100 nl), the 5-HT2A agonist R(-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI, 50 microg/kg, i.v.) increased ear pinna sympathetic nerve activity from 3+/-2% to 129+/-5% of pre-muscimol levels (P<0.01, n=6), and this increase was abolished by section of the ipsilateral cervical sympathetic nerve trunk. MDMA (2 mg/kg, i.v.) after muscimol decreased ear pinna blood flow from 33+/-10 to 2+/-1 cm/s (P<0.01, n=5) and increased ear pinna sympathetic nerve activity from 8+/-4% to 120+/-41% of pre-muscimol levels (P<0.01, n=6). The MDMA-elicited increase in nerve activity was abolished by SR 46349B. Data suggest that spinal 5-HT2A receptors contribute to sympathetically induced cutaneous vasoconstriction regulated by raphe/parapyramidal neurons in the brainstem, and that these receptors contribute to the cutaneous vasoconstricting action of MDMA and its reversal by clozapine.
