Pranzatelli, M. R., et al. (1990). "The functional significance of neonatal 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine lesions in the rat: response to selective 5-HT1A and 5-HT2,1C agonists." Brain Res Bull 24(6): 747-753.

	To study the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes in behavioral supersensitivity following neonatal 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) lesions, we measured acute behavioral responses to a single dose of selective 5-HT1A (8-OH-DPAT) or 5-HT2,1C (DOI) agonist compared to 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in rats injected with 5,7-DHT intraperitoneally or intracisternally 14 weeks earlier. Only intraperitoneal 5,7-DHT injection resulted in brainstem 5-HT hyperinnervation, but cortical 5-HT depletions were also less. Effects of DOI, such as shaking behavior and forepaw myoclonus, were enhanced by 5,7-DHT lesions made intracisternally not intraperitoneally, whereas 8-OH-DPAT-evoked behaviors, such as forepaw myoclonus and head weaving, were enhanced more by the intraperitoneal route. The main consequence of intraperitoneal compared to intracisternal 5,7-DHT injection on supersensitivity to 5-HT agonists was increased presynaptic 5-HT1A responses and decreased 5-HT2,1C responses. In contrast, 5-HTP evoked more shaking behavior and less of the serotonin syndrome with the intraperitoneal compared to the intracisternal route of 5,7-DHT injection. Behavioral supersensitivity to 5-HTP, which was attributable to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2,1C, and possibly to other 5-HT receptors, was orders of magnitude greater than that elicited by direct receptor agonists and more clearly differentiated between rats with 5,7-DHT lesions and their controls, and between routes of 5,7-DHT injections, than responses to 5-HT agonists at the dose studied. 5,7-DHT induced dysregulation of 5-HT receptors, including both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes and altered interactions between receptor subtypes, better explains these data than postsynaptic changes alone.
