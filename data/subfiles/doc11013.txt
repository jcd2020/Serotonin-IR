	The function of the helix VII Tyr in the conserved Asn-Pro-X-X-Tyr segment of rhodopsin-like G protein coupled receptors has been investigated in many receptors. Various effects of site-directed mutation of this locus have been found, including altered coupling, sequestration and agonist affinity. We report the first constitutively active mutations of this Tyr. In the serotonin 5HT(2C) receptor, substituting Ala or Cys for Tyr resulted in a marked increase in the basal level of inositol phosphate accumulation in transfected COS-1 cells. This constitutive signaling was abolished by the inverse agonist SB206553. Introducing Phe at this locus eliminated both basal and agonist-stimulated signaling. All three mutant receptors showed an increase in binding affinity for the structurally dissimilar agonists 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT), (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), and quipazine, suggesting that both the activating and inactivating mutations stabilize a high affinity state. These results implicate the conserved Tyr in the conformational rearrangements that occur during agonist complexing and receptor activation.
