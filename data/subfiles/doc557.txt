Avgustinovich, D. F., et al. (1999). "Changes in brain serotonergic activity in anxious losers." Biogenic Amines 15(4): 395-404.

	Previous experiments showed that repeated experience of defeats in ten daily agonistic confrontations produced pronounced anxiety in C57BL/6J male mice (losers) as estimated by some plus-maze parameters and decreased communicative behavior observed in the partition test (Avgustinovich et at, 1997). Tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) activity and the levels of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the midbrain, hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus and striatum have been measured and analysed in anxious losers. The data showed that pronounced anxiety developing in losers was accompanied by changes of serotonin metabolism in the various brain areas differently. A lower 5-HIAA level and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the hippocampus as well as lower 5-HIAA level and decreased TPH activity in the amygdala were found in the anxious losers in comparison with the control (5 days of individual housing). Elevated 5-HIAA level and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio were shown in the midbrain of the losers. The increased TPH activity was found in the hypothalamus of the losers. [(3)H]8-OH-DPAT binding (B(max)) was decreased in the losers' frontal cortex and amygdala but not changed in the midbrain. Flesinoxan (0.5 mg/kg, i. p.), the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, was ineffective in changing the communicative behavior of the losers in the partition test. Reduce of brain 5-HT(1A) receptor sensitivity have been suggested in the anxious losers under influence of social defeats. It was suggested that the development of pronounced anxiety in the losers due to the repeated social confrontations is accompanied by hypoactivity of serotonergic system in the amygdala and hippocampus.
