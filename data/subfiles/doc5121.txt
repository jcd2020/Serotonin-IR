	BACKGROUND: Our previous studies have demonstrated that the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-HT 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) in serum and platelet were associated with depression and myocardial infarction (MI), and pretreatment with ginseng fruit saponins (GFS) before MI and depression had an effect on the 5-HT system. In this study, the effects of GFS on the 5-HT system in the Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with MI, depression, and MI + depression were evaluated. METHODS: A total of eighty SD rats were allocated to four groups: MI, depression, MI + depression, and control groups (n = 20 in each group). Each group included two subgroups (n = 10 in each subgroup): Saline treatment subgroup and GFS treatment subgroup. The levels of 5-HT, 5-HT2AR, and serotonin transporter (SERT) were quantified in serum, platelet lysate, and brain tissue through the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with those in the saline treatment subgroups, the levels of 5-HT in serum and platelet lysate statistically significantly increased in the GFS treatment subgroups of MI, depression, and MI + depression groups (serum: all P = 0.000; platelet lysate: P = 0.002, 0.000, 0.000, respectively). However, the 5-HT levels in brain homogenate significantly decreased in the GFS treatment subgroups compared with those in the saline treatment subgroups in MI and depression groups (P = 0.025 and 0.044 respectively), and no significant difference was observed between saline and GFS treatment subgroups in MI + depression group (P = 0.663). Compared with that in GFS treatment subgroup of control group, the 5-HT2AR levels in the platelet lysate significantly decreased in GFS treatment subgroups of MI, depression, and MI + depression groups (all P = 0.000). Compared to those in the saline treatment subgroups, the serum SERT levels significantly decreased in the GFS treatment subgroups in MI, depression, and MI + depression groups (P = 0.009, 0.038, and P = 0.001, respectively), while the SERT levels of platelet lysate significantly decreased in GFS treatment subgroup of MI group (P = 0.000), significantly increased in GFS treatment subgroup of depression group (P = 0.019), and slightly changed in GFS treatment subgroup of MI + depression group (P = 0.219). No significant changes for SERT levels in brain homogenate could be found between the saline and GFS treatment subgroups in MI, depression, and MI + depression groups (P = 0.421, 0.076 and P = 0.642). CONCLUSIONS: This study indicated that GFS might inhibit the reuptake of 5-HT from serum to platelet according to decreased 5-HT2AR in platelet and SERT in serum and platelet. The change of 5-HT in serum after GFS treatment was inconsistent with that in the brain. It seemed that GFS could not pass through the blood-brain barrier to affect the central serotonergic system.
