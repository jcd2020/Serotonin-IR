Vandecapelle, M., et al. (2004). "Synthesis and preliminary in vivo evaluation of 4 F-18 fluoro-N-{2- 4-(6-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl ethyl}benzamide, a potential PET radioligand for the 5-HT1A receptor." Journal of Labelled Compounds & Radiopharmaceuticals 47(9): 531-542.

	4-Fluoro-N-{2-[4-(6-trifluoromethylpyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}benzamide is a full 5-HT1A agonist with high affinity (pK(i) = 9.3), selectivity and a c log P of 3.045. The corresponding PET radioligand 4-[F-18]fluoro-N-{2-[4-(6-trifluoromethylpyridin2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}benzamide was synthesized by nucleophilic aromatic substitution on the nitro precursor. The fluorinating agent K[F-18]F/Kryptofix 2.2.2 was both dried (9 min, 700 W) and incorporated in the precursor (5 min, 700 W) using a commercially available microwave oven. In a total synthesis time of 60 min, an overall radiochemical yield of 18% (SD = 5, n = 7, EOS) was obtained. Radiochemical purity was always higher than 99% and specific activity always higher than 81.4 GBq/mumol (2.2 Ci/mumol). Initial brain uptake in mice was 2.19% ID (5.47% ID/g, 2 min) but decreased rapidly (0.17% ID, 0.45% ID/g (60 min)). During the first 20 min p.i., radioactivity concentration of the brain was significantly higher than that of blood demonstrating good brain entry of the tracer.
