Shilling, P. D., et al. (2004). "Neurotensin agonists block the prepulse inhibition deficits produced by a 5-HT2A and an alpha(1) agonist." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 175(3): 353-359.

	Rationale: Neurotensin (NT) agonists have been proposed as potential antipsychotics based exclusively upon their ability to inhibit dopamine-2 (D-2) receptor transmission. Several other pharmacological mechanisms have been implicated in enhancing the antipsychotic profile produced by D-2 inhibition alone. These include inhibition of 5-HT2A and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Recently, we reported that systemic administration of the neurotensin agonist PD149163 blocks deficits in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex produced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI. This suggested that NT agonists could inhibit 5-HT2A modulation of neurotransmission. Objective: To determine if other peripherally administered NT agonists shared this effect, we examined the effects of NT69L, another NT agonist, on DOI-induced PPI deficits. In addition, to determine if NT agonists also inhibit alpha(1)-adrenoceptor neurotransmission, we examined the effects of PD149163 and NT69L on PPI deficits induced by the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist, cirazoline. Methods: In the NT69L/DOI study, rats received subcutaneous (SC) injections of NT69L (0, 0.1, 1, or 2 mg/kg) followed 30 min later by SC saline or DOI (0.5 mg/kg). In the NT agonist/cirazoline studies, animals received SC injections of either PD149163 (0, 0.01, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg) or NT69L (0, 0.0 1, 0.1, or 1 mg/kg) followed 30 min later by SC saline cirazoline (0.7 mg/kg). Animals were tested in startle chambers 20 min later.
