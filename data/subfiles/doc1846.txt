	Cocaine induced locomotor stimulant effects are generally attributed to cocaine effects on brain dopamine. In this report, we present evidence that the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT) and the 5-HT1A antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-"piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-cycylhexanecarboxaminde maleate (WAY 100635) can enhance or block, respectively, the locomotor stimulant effects induced by cocaine. In two separate experiments, rats administered cocaine (10 mg/kg) exhibited a locomotor stimulant effect and decreased grooming behavior compared to saline treated rats. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OHDPAT (0.2 mg/kg) enhanced and pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.4 mg/kg) eliminated the locomotor stimulant effect of cocaine. Neither the 8-OHDPAT nor WAY 100635 effects were attributable to effects on the behavioral baseline. The 8-OHDPAT and WAY 100635 had opposite effects on Grooming behavior. 8-OHDPAT decreased and WAY 100635 increased grooming. Neither treatment, however, affected the grooming suppression induced by cocaine. Ex vivo biochemical measurements indicated that neither 8-OHDPAT or WAY 100635 affected brain dopamine metabolism or cocaine availability in brain. Both treatments affected 5-HT metabolism and altered the effect of cocaine on 5-HT metabolism. 8-OHDPAT increased and WAY 100635 decreased cocaine effects on 5-HT metabolism. Cocaine and 8-OHDPAT but not WAY 100635 increased corticosterone. Altogether, these findings indicate that the 5-HT1A receptor site may be an important target for the development of pharmaco therapies for the treatment of cocaine abuse.
