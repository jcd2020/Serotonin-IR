Nikulina, E. M. (1991). "INFLUENCE OF IPSAPIRONE AN AGONIST OF 5-HT1A RECEPTORS, ON SOME KINDS OF BEHAVIOR OF WILD AND DOMESTICATED RATS." Zhurnal Vysshei Nervnoi Deyatelnosti Imeni I P Pavlova 41(6): 1149-1153.

	Selective agonist of 1A subtype of serotonin receptors ipsapirone inhibited manifestation of affective kinds of aggression in wild and domesticated rats. Administration of ipsapirone (10 mg/kg) decreased the number of aggressive attacks of wild and domesticated rats in the test of shock-induced aggression and blocked manifestation of defensive reaction to the experimentator in wild rats. Neophobia in wild rats decreased under the influence of ipsapirone. At the same time ipsapirone did not change mouse-killing behaviour either in wild or in domesticated rats. Probably, 5-HT1A receptors the aggressive regulate reaction, which are parts of the complex of defensive behaviour of the wild animals.
