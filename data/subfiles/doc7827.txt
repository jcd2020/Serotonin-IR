	Drug addiction is a major psychiatric disease with, currently, no truly effective treatment available. Drug addiction involves many different behaviors. Given the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in virtually all behaviors and brain plasticity at cellular, molecular and systems levels, one can readily assume a 5-HT contribution to the establishment and maintenance of addiction-related behaviors and their neuronal mechanisms. In this chapter we review the role of the 5-HT system in addiction-related behaviors for major addictive drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), morphine, heroin and nicotine. We discuss the impact of these drugs on 5-HT activity, and how this activity might translate into behavior by activating 5-HT receptors. The effects of serotonergic manipulations on addiction-related behaviors in animal models and in human therapy of addiction are reviewed. Intensive research has shown that drug-induced 5-HT activation does not have a uniform 'proactive effect' (i.e., neurochemical activity that triggers behavioral activation) on addiction-related behavior, but might often serve a 'counteractive function', thus limiting the expression of behavior which is driven by other neurochemical effects of the drug. 5-HT receptors can have very different effects on addiction-related behaviors depending on their localization in the brain, the cell type, and the synapse. Some receptor populations do appear to have proactive effects - i.e., translate the drug-induced 5-HT increase into addiction-related behaviors - while others counteract them, or are not involved. While acknowledging this complexity will be important for an understanding of the 5-HT role in drug addiction, it also provides a challenge to the use of 5-HT system components for therapy in humans.
