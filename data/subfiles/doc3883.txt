	The influence of age, postmortem delay and freezing storage period on receptor-mediated G-protein activity was quantified in cortical membranes from 34 healthy subjects. Concentration-response curves of the [S-35]GTPgammaS binding stimulation by agonists for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (UK14304), mu-opioid (DAMGO), 5-HT1A (8-OH-DPAT), GABA(B) (baclofen) and muscarinic (carbachol) receptors were analyzed. Immunoreactivities of G(alpha)-protein subunits were also determined. Basal binding and UK14304, 8-OH-DPAT, and baclofen potency to stimulate [S-35]GTPgammaS binding decreased with aging (1-88 years) without changes of efficacy. DAMGO-mediated stimulation increased both in potency and efficacy with aging. A negative correlation between age and immunoreactivity was observed for G(alphai1/2)- but not for G(alphai3)-, G(alpha0)-, and G(alphas)-proteins. Neither [S-35]GTPgammaS binding nor G.-proteins changed with the postmortem delay (8-92 h). Basal [S-35]GTPgammaS binding decreased with the sample storage period (1-85 months). A careful match between cases and controls should be taken into account when designing signal transduction studies in human disorders, specially for variables such as age and storage period.
