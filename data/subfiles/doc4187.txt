Hagino, Y. and M. Watanabe (2002). "Effects of clozapine on the efflux of serotonin and dopamine in the rat brain: the role of 5-HT1A receptors." Canadian Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 80(12): 1158-1166.

	In vivo microdialysis in conscious rats was used to examine the effect of clozapine on serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) efflux in the prefrontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus and dopamine efflux in the prefrontal cortex. Both systemic and local administration of clozapine (systemic,10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.; local, 100 muM) increased 5-HT efflux in the dorsal raphe. However, in the prefrontal cortex, dialysate 5-HT increased when clozapine (100 muM) was administered through the probe, while no effect was observed when it was administered systemically. By pretreatment with the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist p-MPPI (3 mg/kg, i.p.), systemic treatment of clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly increased 5-HT efflux in the prefrontal cortex. This result suggests that the ability of clozapine to enhance the extracellular concentrations of 5-HT in the dorsal raphe attenuates this drug's effect in the frontal cortex, probably through the stimulation of 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe. We also found that pretreatment with p-MPPI (3 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated by 45% the rise in cortical dopamine levels induced by clozapine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). These findings imply that the reduction in serotonergic input from the dorsal raphe nucleus induced by clozapine could lead to an increase in dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex.
