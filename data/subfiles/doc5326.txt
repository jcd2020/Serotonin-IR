Higgins, G. A. (2017). "(18)F-FPP: A PET Ligand for the 5-HT2C Receptor?" ACS Chem Neurosci 8(5): 904-907.

	In the current issue of ACS Chemical Neuroscience, Kim et al. report on the early characterization of 4-(3-[(18)F] fluorophenethoxy)pyrimidine ((18)F-FPP) as a new positron emission tomography radiotracer for imaging brain 5-HT2C receptors ( Kim, J., et al. ( 2017 ) A potential PET radiotracer for the 5-HT2c receptor: Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of 4-(3-[(18)F]Fluorophenethoxy)pyrimidine. ACS Chem. Neurosci. , DOI: 10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00445 ). At the present time, the tracer properties of (18)F-FPP have only been reported in rats. If (18)F-FPP is indeed shown to be suitable as a 5-HT2C receptor PET tracer in humans, it will very likely have an important impact both in the development of any new chemical entities (NCEs) targeted to 5-HT2C receptors, as well as a tool to advance understanding of 5-HT2C receptor function both in normal and abnormal brain states.
