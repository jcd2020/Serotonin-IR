	1 The effects of the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonists SB-269970 (3-300 mug kg(-1); n = 5-6) and SB-656104 (30 mug kg(-1), n = 5) administered centrally (i.c.v.) were investigated on the 'micturition reflex' in the urethane anaesthetized female rat. 2 In cystometric recordings, SB-269970 caused significant increases in volume of 58 +/- 15 and 138+/-33% and pressure of 140+/-46 and 149+/-60% thresholds at 10 and 30 mug kg(-1). These changes were associated with significant decreases in distension-induced bladder contraction of 62+/-14 and 60 +/- 11%, respectively. However, there was no change in residual volume. At the higher doses, SB-269970 blocked the micturition reflex. SB-656104 had similar effects to SB-269970 but in addition significantly increased the residual volume. 3 SB-269970 (10 mug kg(-1); n = 5) given i.v. had no effect on the micturition reflex. 4 SB-269970 (30 mug kg(-1); n = 4) given intrathecally (i.t.) had no effect on micturition reflex, although the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 given i.t. after SB-269970 caused a significant increase in the volume threshold. 5 Using an isovolumetric method in which urethral changes were measured, SB-269970 (30 mug kg(-1); n = 4: i.c.v.) failed to have any effect on these urethral-evoked changes although they significantly reduced the amplitude of the bladder contraction. 6 These data demonstrate that 5-HT7 receptors located supraspinally in the rat are involved in the control of micturition.
