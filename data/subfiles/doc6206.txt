Judge, S. J. and S. E. Gartside (2006). "Firing of 5-HT neurones in the dorsal and median raphe nucleus in vitro shows differential alpha1-adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A receptor modulation." Neurochem Int 48(2): 100-107.

	The median raphe nucleus and dorsal raphe nucleus together are the major source of ascending 5-HT projections. Here, using in vitro extracellular single unit electrophysiology we examined the responses of individual neurones in the rat median raphe nucleus and dorsal raphe nucleus to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor and 5-HT(1A) receptor activation and made comparisons between the two nuclei. In the presence of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine (1microM) all spontaneously active neurones recorded in the median and dorsal raphe nuclei fired slowly (<5Hz) and regularly. Most were inhibited by 5-HT (10-50microM), although a few were excited by 5-HT. 5-HT-induced inhibition was attenuated by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY100635 (100nM). Compared to those in the dorsal raphe nucleus, the neurones in the median raphe nucleus which were inhibited by 5-HT had: (1) lower basal firing rates in the continuous presence of phenylephrine (1microM), (2) smaller excitatory responses to higher concentrations of phenylephrine (3-10microM), (3) smaller excitatory responses to brief application of norepinephrine (10-100microM) and (4) smaller inhibitory responses to 5-HT (10-50microM). The lower sensitivity of median raphe neurones to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor excitation and 5-HT(1A) receptor inhibition will have consequences for 5-HT neurotransmission in forebrain regions innervated by the two nuclei.
