Tur≈Ço, J. and T. Zawadowski (1996). "Synthesis of N,N'-bis-aminoalkyl-substituted derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-7-ene-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxydiimide with potential anxiolytic activity." Farmaco 51(12): 815-818.

	In continuation of the search for discovering new antipsychotic and anxiolytic agents with a reduced production of extrapyramidala side-effects, a series of N,N'-bis-aminoalkyl derivatives of bicyclo[2.2.2]oct-7-ene tetracarboxydiimide was prepared. Evaluation of these compounds in vitro revealed a very low affinity for 5-HT1A receptor.
