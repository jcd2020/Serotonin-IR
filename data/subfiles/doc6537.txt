Kimura, Y., et al. (2006). "Characterization of intracavernous pressure increase induced by Ym348, a novel 5-HT2C receptor agonist, in anesthetized rats." Journal of Urology 175(5): 1953-1957.

	Purpose: We investigated the effects of the novel 5-HT2C receptor agonist YM348 [(S)-2-(7-ethyl-1H-furo[2,3-glindazol-1-yl)-1-methylethylamine] on ICP in anesthetized rats and clarified whether behavioral changes such as hypolocomotion induced at a high dose are a cause of the inverted U-shaped PE dose-response curves in conscious rats. Materials and Methods: Male Wistar rats (Japan SLC, Shizuoka, Japan) weighing 250 to 315 gm were used. The pro-erectile effect of YM348 (2.03 to 67.7 mu g/kg subcutaneously) was examined in conscious rats. ICP was also monitored after YM348 treatment (0.677 to 67.7 mu g/kg subcutaneously) in anesthetized rats. Response number, latency, duration, peak pressure and area under the curve were measured. The selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB242084 [(6-chloro-5-methyl-1-[6-(2-methylpyridin-3-yloxy) pyridin-3-yl carbamoyl] indoline)] (0.03 to 1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was administered 30 minutes before YM348 treatment. Results: YM348 induced PE and ICP increases, and was significantly inhibited by SB242084. Dose-response curves for the number of PEs and ICP increases were an inverted U shape. YM348 decreased the latency of but did not affect the quality of ICP (duration, peak pressure and area under the curve) even at the highest dose. Conclusions: Activation of 5-HT2C receptor increased ICP and, as a result, induced PE. Since the dose-response curve for the number of ICP increases under anesthetized, behavior independent conditions still showed an inverted U shape, behavioral changes were not likely to have contributed to the inverted U-shaped dose-response curves for the number of PEs in conscious rats. Furthermore, the certain magnitude of ICP increases was likely to have occurred despite the stimulus intensity after the level of 5-HT2C receptor activation crossed the threshold.
