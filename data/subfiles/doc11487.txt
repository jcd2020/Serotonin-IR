	1. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that 5-HT1A receptor agonists are a new class of mixed axiolytics/antidepressants with, possibly, impulsivity reducing properties. 2. The anxiolytic effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonists result predominantly from an interaction with presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors (resulting in a decrease of serotonergic transmission), whereas the antidepressive and, possibly, the impulse control enhancing effects, result predominantly from an interaction with postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. 3. These proposed mechanism(s) of action fit well with the generally held view that anxiety is the result of a hypersensitive 5-HT system; whereas impulsivity and depression is the result of a hyposensitive 5-HT system. 4. However, it appears very likely that activation of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors is additionally involved in the antidepressive and impulse control enhancing effects, on the one hand, and in the anxiolytic effects of these compounds, on the other hand. 5. These latter, seemingly paradoxical, findings can be explained by assuming that (1) the presynaptic mechanism reflects an anxiolytic component in the animal models of impulsivity and depression, (2) antagonism of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors by these compounds contributes to their anxiolytic effects, (3) postsynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors have functionally opposing effects or, alternatively, that (4) downregulation of postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors contributes to the therapeutic effects of these compounds.
