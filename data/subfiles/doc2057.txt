Chaouloff, F., et al. (1997). "Effects of food deprivation on midbrain 5-HT1A autoreceptors in Lewis and SHR rats." Neuropharmacology 36(4-5): 483-488.

	Food deprivation stimulates the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and brain serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) synthesis. Because midbrain somato-dendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors may obey homologous and heterologous (e.g. by glucocorticoids) down-regulation, we have analyzed whether 24 hr of fasting affects midbrain 5-HT1A receptor binding and sensitivity in Lewis and SHR rats (i.e. strains that differ in behavioral/neuroendocrine responses to stressors). Fasting affected neither [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT) binding at 5-HT1A autoreceptors nor 8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of midbrain 5-HT synthesis (an index of 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity). Because fasting increased 5-HT precursor (tryptophan) levels to similar extents in the midbrains of saline- and 8-OH-DPAT-treated rats, we conclude that food deprivation does not affect 5-HT1A autoreceptors. In turn, our results suggest that the differential effects of 5-HT1A receptor agonists on food intake, in fed and fasted rats map be independent from 5-HT1A autoreceptors.
