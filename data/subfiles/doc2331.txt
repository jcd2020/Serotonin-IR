	The present study investigated whether the serotonergic system is involved in mediating the behavioral effects of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in juvenile spring chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha. An intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of CRH induced hyperactivity. The effect of CRH was potentiated in a dose-dependent manner by the concurrent administration of the serotonin (5-HT) selective reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine. However, administration of fluoxetine alone had no effect on locomotor activity, suggesting that the locomotor-stimulating effect of CRH is mediated by the activation of the serotonergic system. Conversely, ICV injections of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN-190 attenuated the effect of CRH on locomotor activity when given in combination with CRH but had no effect when administered alone. These results provide the first evidence to support the hypothesis that the effect of CRH on locomotor activity in teleosts is mediated by activating the serotonergic system.
