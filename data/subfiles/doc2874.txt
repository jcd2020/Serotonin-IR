Dyr, W. and W. Kostowski (1995). "EVIDENCE THAT THE AMYGDALA IS INVOLVED IN THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF 5-HT3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS ON ALCOHOL-DRINKING IN RATS." Alcohol 12(4): 387-391.

	Two 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, tropisetron (1 and 10 ng) and ondansetron (10 and 100 ng) were tested for effects on ethanol drinking in Wistar male rats after bilateral microinjection into the amygdala. The animals had limited access (2 h/day) to the 10% (v/v) ethanol solution, food and water were available ad lib during the scheduled access period. Both drugs caused a decrease in ethanol drinking. Tropisetron (1 and 10 ng) decreased ethanol intake during the first hour of access. The lower dose (10 ng) of ondansetron was more effective than the higher (100 ng) dose. The finding implicates amygdaloid 5-HT3 receptors in the mechanism of ethanol intake in Wistar rats.
