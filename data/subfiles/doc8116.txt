Masalov, I. S., et al. (2012). "[Effect of antagonists of 5-HT receptors on modulation with serotonin of synaptical activity of projectional neurons of dorsolateral nucleus of rat amygdala]." Zh Evol Biokhim Fiziol 48(5): 455-460.

	The work deals with study of role of different serotonin (5-HT) receptor types in the process of synaptic activity modulation of rat dorsolateral amygdale projection neurons with serotonin. The selective antagonist of 5-HT1,2 receptors methylsergide maleate was shown to suppress the 5-HT inhibitory action on amplitude of the postsynaptic currents evoked by glutamate and GABA, whereas the antagonist of 5-HT3,4 receptors SDZ202-557 produced no effect on the above-mentioned 5-HT action. The obtained action indicates that the 5-HT modulatory effect on the projectional neuron synaptic inputs is mediated by 5-HT receptors of the 1 and 2 types.
