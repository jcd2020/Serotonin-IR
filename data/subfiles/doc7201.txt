	Serotonin (5-HT) appears to play a modulatory role in the behavioral effects of cocaine, although the impact of 5-HT2C receptors in this control has not been fully established. The aim of the present study was to establish whether acute pretreatment with the selective 5-HT2C/2B antagonist SB 206553 (1, 2, and 4 mg/kg IP) altered hyperactivity induced by cocaine (15 mg/kg, IP) using an open field activity system which recorded central, peripheral, and rearing activity. Pretreatment with 1 and 2 mg/kg of SB 206553 attenuated cocaine-induced central and peripheral activity, respectively; rearing was also attenuated by the latter dose. However, the 4-mg/kg dose of SB 206553 significantly enhanced the effects of cocaine on peripheral activity. Based upon the present observations and an interpretation of previous research to implicate 5-HT2C receptor control of the dopamine (DA) mesoaccumbens pathways in behavior, a thorough and systematic analysis of the role of 5-HT2C (and 5-HT2B) receptors in psychostimulant-induced behaviors is warranted.
