Sela, V. R., et al. (2011). "Serotonin-1A receptors in the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter mediate the panicolytic-like effect of pindolol and paroxetine combination in the elevated T-maze." Neurosci Lett 495(1): 63-66.

	The β-adrenergic blocker and 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist pindolol has been combined with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in patients with depressive and anxiety disorders to shorten the onset of the clinical action and/or increase the proportion of responders. The results of a previous study have shown that pindolol potentiates the panicolytic effect of paroxetine in rats submitted to the elevated T-maze (ETM). Since reported evidence has implicated the 5-HT(1A) receptors of the dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (DPAG) in the panicolytic effect of antidepressants, rats treated with pindolol (5.0mg/kg, i.p.) and paroxetine (1.5mg/kg, i.p.) received a previous intra-DPAG injection of the selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist, WAY-100635 (0.4 μg) and were submitted to the ETM. Pretreatment with WAY-100635 reversed the increase in escape latency, a panicolytic effect, determined by the pindolol-paroxetine combination. These results implicate the 5-HT(1A) receptors of the DPAG in the panicolytic effect of the pindolol-paroxetine combination administered systemically. They also give further preclinical support for the use of this drug combination in the treatment of panic disorder.
