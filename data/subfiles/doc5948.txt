	Selective dopamine (D) receptor agonists either slightly improve (D2 and D3) or do not affect (D1 and D4) the tolerance of the brain to global ischemia. As for D and 5-HT (hydroxytryptamine) antagonists, only D1 antagonist SCH 23390 and 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin produce a small neuroprotective effect, while D2, D4, 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) antagonists are not active. Simultaneous injection of D2 (raclopride), D3 (GR 103691), and D4 (L 745870) receptor blockers also does not protect the brain. These results are not at variance with a widespread hypothesis that the accumulation of extracellular 5-HT and especially D in the brain causes the neuron damage. The effect of ketanserine is not increased by D2 or D4 blockers, but the introduction of D3 blocker GR 103691 (+88%) and especially the simultaneous injection of D2,3,4 antagonists improve the effect of ketanserine (+134%). The neuroprotective effect of the last combination is not lower but even exceeds that of some neuroleptics. This fact shows the possibility to increase the tolerance to cerebral ischemia by simultaneously blocking D and 5-HT-receptors.
