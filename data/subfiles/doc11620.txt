Walcourtambakederemo, A. and W. Winlow (1994). "5-HT RECEPTORS ON IDENTIFIED LYMNAEA NEURONS IN CULTURE - PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF 5-HT1A RECEPTORS." Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology C-Toxicology & Pharmacology 107(1): 129-141.

	The ability of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist R(+)-8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) to bind with 5-HT receptor(s) on cultured, identified neurones in Lymnaea stagnalis was examined. The identified neurones studied were from the buccal ganglia and the serotonin-containing cerebral giant cells (CGCs). 5-HT and its agonists were applied from puffer pipettes, whilst 5-HT antagonists were applied in the bathing medium. At 10(-3) M, the 5-HT1A agonist, always produced paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDS) while at a lower concentration (10(-4) M), it always mimicked the effects of 10(-3) M 5-HT. 8-OH-DPAT (10(-4) M) and 5-HT (10(-3) M) produced dose-dependent increases in the responses they evoked. At 10(-4) M, the 5-HT3 receptor agonist 1-(m -chlorophenyl)-biguanide hydrochloride (m-CPBG), failed to hyperpolarize most of the neurones hyperpolarized by 5-HT. At 10(-4) M, the antagonists ketanserin (5-HT2), MDL 72222 (5-HT3), and pindobind-5-HT1A (5-HT1A) consistently abolished spike generation in spontaneously active neurones. Both ketanserin and MDL 72222 failed to block the actions of 8-OH-DPAT and only partially blocked those of 5-HT, but pindobind-5-HT1A completely, but reversibly, blocked the 8-OH-DPAT effects while greatly reducing those of 5-HT. These results suggest that 5-HT1A receptor subtypes might be involved in the hyperpolarizing responses of the CGCs and their follower motor neurones in the buccal ganglia of Lymnaea stagnalis to 5-HT. The presence of 5-HT(1)A receptors on these neurones can be considered to correspond with those found in mammals because their pharmacological responses resemble those of mammalian 5-HT1A receptors.
