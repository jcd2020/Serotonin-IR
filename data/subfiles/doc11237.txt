Uchida, H., et al. (1995). "PHARMACOLOGICAL PROFILE OF (-)HT-90B, A NOVEL 5-HT1A RECEPTOR AGONIST 5-HT2 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST." Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 19(7): 1201-1216.

	1. HT-90B ((-)-N-([2-(8-methyl-1, 4-benzodioxane-2-ylmethyl)amino]ethyl)tricyclo[3,3,1,1 (3,7)] decane-1-carboxamide) had high affinities for the 5-HT1A (Ki = 0.18 nM) and 5-HT2 (Ki = 9.2 nM) receptors. 2. HT-90B inhibited forskolin activated adenylate cyclase in rat hippocampal membranes as a 5-HT1A full agonist (IC50 = 2 nM), and the potency of the drug was higher than that of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a standard 5-HT1A agonist. 3. In the serotonin syndrome test, HT-90B behaved as a weak partial 5-HT1A agonist in reserpinized rats. 4. 5-HT2 receptor-mediated potentiation of rabbit platelet aggregation by serotonin (5-HT) was reduced by HT-90B (IC50 = 1.73 mu M). 5. Head twitch response induced by 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), a 5-HT2 agonist, was inhibited by HT-90B in mice. 6. It is concluded that HT-90B has potent 5-HT1A receptor agonist as well as 5-HT2 receptor antagonist properties in vitro and in vivo.
