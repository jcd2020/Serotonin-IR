Dave, K. D., et al. (2007). "The time-course for up- and down-regulation of the cortical 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptor density predicts 5-HT2A receptor-mediated behavior in the rabbit." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 323(1): 327-335.

	5-Hydroxytryptamine(serotonin; 5-HT)(2) receptor agonists such as (+/-)-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) injected systemically or directly into frontal cortex, elicit stereotyped head movements that are mediated by 5-HT2A receptors. Chronic administration of 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can produce either a down- regulation, e. g., d-2-bromolysergic acid diethylamide (BOL) or an up-regulation, e. g., alpha-phenyl-10(2-phenylethyl)- 4-piperidinemethanol ( MDL11,939) of cortical 5-HT2A receptors in the rabbit with no change in the density of the 5-HT2C receptor. We examined the degree to which the time course for the onset and offset of changes in cortical 5-HT2A receptor density was correlated with functional changes as measured by the magnitude of DOI elicited, 5-HT2A receptor-mediated head movements (head bobs). First, the magnitude of DOI-elicited head bobs was measured over 1 to 8 days after chronic BOL (5.8 mu mol/kg), MDL11,939 (10 mu mol/kg), or vehicle administration. Second, rabbits were injected with BOL, MDL11,939, or vehicle once daily for 8 days, and then, 1 to 8 days after the cessation of drug or vehicle, DOI-elicited head bobs were determined. Samples of frontal cortex were obtained for each animal immediately following behavioral testing, and 5-HT2A receptor density was measured using [H-3] ketanserin. Thus, each animal provided a value for receptor density and number of head bobs, and these two measures showed a high degree of correlation between 0.94 for BOL and 0.95 for MDL11,939. This study establishes that the density of 5-HT2A receptors in cortex reflects their functional status.
