	The actions of serotonin (5-HT) and its putative agonists and antagonists were examined in vitro on hippocampal CA1 neurons using intracellular recordings, demonstrating that the cellular pharmacological effects can not necessarily be predicted from binding characteristics alone. The first response following 5-HT application was often a long-lasting (several minutes) hyperpolarization associated with decreased input resistance. Subsequent 5-HT applications caused only brief hyperpolarizations (30-120 s) and associated decreased input resistance, often followed by membrane depolarization. The post-spike train afterhyperpolarization (AHP) was prolonged for several minutes following the 5-HT induced hyperpolarization. 5-HT1 agonists (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, 5-methoxytryptamine, MK-212) caused a prolonged hyperpolarization, decreased input resistance, and enhancement of the AHP. 5-HT applied following agonist application elicited only short-lasting hyperpolarizations. The 5-HT2 antagonists, cyproheptadine and mianserin, and a nonspecific 5-HT antagonist, methysergide, also caused a prolonged hyperpolarization with decreased input resistance. Spiperone, a nonspecific 5-HT antagonist, and ritanserin, a putative specific 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, depolarized CA1 neurons with little or no change in input resistance. The 5-HT-induced short-lasting hyperpolarization was not affected by drop application of 5-HT antagonists, except for methysergide, but perfusion of methysergide, ritanserin, and spiperone attenuated this response. The long-lasting 5-HT hyperpolarization might be mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activation, and the short-lasting hyperpolarization by another serotonergic receptor subtype.
