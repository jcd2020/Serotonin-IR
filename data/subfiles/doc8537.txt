Paluchowska, M. H., et al. (2001). "Substitution mode of the amide fragment in some new N-[omega-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]alkyl]pyrid-2(1H)-ones and their 5-HT1A/5-HT2A activity." Pol J Pharmacol 53(4): 369-376.

	A series of omega-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]alkyl derivatives with terminal pyrid-2(1H)-one fragments was synthesized and evaluated for their 5-HTIA and 5-HT2A activity. Enlargement of the aromatic amide system by its substitution with phenyl and/or p-methoxyphenyl in positions 4, 5 and/or 6, as well as modification of an aliphatic spacer allowed us to better understand structure-activity relationships in that group of compounds. The results of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that only unsubstituted (1b) and monosubstituted (2b-4b) derivatives with the tetramethylene spacer demonstrated high 5-HTIA receptor affinity (Ki = 15-40 nM) and 5-HT1A/5-HT2A selectivity; they exhibited features of 5-HTIA antagonists. Those results suggested that the mode of substitution of the terminal amide moiety in the tested tetramethylene arylpiperazines was not significant for their 5-HTIA receptor activity. Conformational analysis calculations indicated that despite its great capacity for adaptation at 5-HTIA receptor site, an aryl substituent in position 4 in the pyrid-2(1H)-one ring destabilized the ligand-5-HT1A receptor complex formation in the case of trimethylene derivatives. Diarylsubstituted derivatives (5a-8a and 5b-8b) were characterized by a low 5-HT2A affinity (Ki > 446 nM) regardless of the spacer length, while those with the tetramethylene aliphatic chain had a higher 5-HT2A affinity than the remaining investigated compounds.
