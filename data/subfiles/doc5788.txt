	Our previous study showed that conditioned fear stress (CFS) increased serotonin (5-HT) metabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex and induced freezing behavior. Although these results could support the 5-HT hypothesis of anxiety, the functional significance of the 5-HT response to stress is unclear. In this study, the effects of 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, agonists, antagonists, and diazepam on freezing behavior induced by CFS were examined using a time-sampling procedure. Various doses of test compounds were administered subcutaneously to rats 24 h after the last session of repeated foot-shock for 5 days. Rats were again placed in the shock chamber without shocks 20 min after injections of drugs, and observed. Diazepam (1 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone (0.5-10 mg/kg) significantly inhibited Freezing behavior. L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (with benserazide) and the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram (10 mg/kg) reduced freezing behavior. The 5-HT2 antagonists ICI169,369 and ketanserin Failed to change freezing behavior. p-Chlorophenylalanine (200 mg/kg) administered 15 h before the test did not affect freezing. The effect of ipsapirone was not modified in rats with lesions of 5-HT neurons, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (2 x 10 mg/kg). In conclusion, these results suggest the anxiolytic potential of ipsapirone and citalopram, and support the hypothesis that the facilitation of 5-HT neurotransmission decreases anxiety.
