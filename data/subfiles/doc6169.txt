Lauder, J. M., et al. (2000). "Expression of 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors in the mouse embryo." International Journal of Developmental Neuroscience 18(7): 653-662.

	Expression patterns of 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors during mouse embryogenesis were investigated using highly specific monoclonal antibodies. Differential and overlapping spatio-temporal patterns of 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor immunoreactivity were observed during active phases of morphogenesis of a variety of embryonic tissues, including neuroepithelia of brain and spinal cord, notochord, somites, cranial neural crest, craniofacial mesenchyme and epithelia, heart myocardium and endocardial cushions, tooth germs, whisker follicles, cartilage and striated muscle. The functional significance of these receptors was tested by exposing headfold stage mouse embryos to different subtype-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonists for 2 days in whole embryo culture. The most potent was the pan 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin, which has high affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor. Ritanserin caused 100% malformed embryos at a dose of 1 mu M. The 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist mianserin also caused a significant number of malformed embryos, but only when used at a 10 fold higher dose (10 mu M). Ketanserin, which primarily targets 5-HT2A receptors, did not cause a significant number of malformed embryos at any dose tested. Together with previous evidence that 5-HT acts as an important morphoregulatory signal during mouse embryogenesis, present evidence for the early and continued expression of functional 5-HT2 receptors throughout gestation raises the possibility that psychotropic drugs taken during pregnancy could interfere with developmental actions of 5-HT during prenatal development of neural and non-neural tissues.
