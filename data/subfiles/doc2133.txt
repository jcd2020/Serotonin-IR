Chen, X. W., et al. (2016). "Synthesis and pharmacological characterization of novel N-(trans-4-(2-(4-(benzo d isothiazol-3-yl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)cyclohexy l) amides as potential multireceptor atypical antipsychotics." Eur J Med Chem 123: 332-353.

	A series of novel benzisothiazolylpiperazine derivatives combining potent dopamine D-2 and D-3, and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor properties were synthesized and evaluated for their potential antipsychotic properties. The most-promising derivative was 9j. The unique pharmacological features of 9j were a high affinity for D-2, D-3, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A receptors, together with a 20-fold selectivity for the D3 versus D-2 subtype, and a low affinity for muscarinic M-1 (reducing the risk of anticholinergic side effects), and for hERG channels (reducing incidence of QT interval prolongation). In animal behavioral models, 9j inhibited the locomotor-stimulating effects of phencyclidine, blocked conditioned avoidance response, and improved the cognitive deficit in the novel object recognition tests in rats. 9j exhibited a low potential for catalepsy, consistent with results with risperidone. In addition, favorable brain penetration of 9j in rats was detected. These studies have demonstrated that 9j is a potential atypical anti psychotic candidate. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.
