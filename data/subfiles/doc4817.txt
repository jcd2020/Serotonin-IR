	The selective, brain penetrant, 5-HT(1B/D) (formerly 5-HT(1D beta/alpha)) receptor agonist SKF-99101H (3-(2-dimethylaminoethyl)-4-chloro-5-propoxyindole hemifumarate) (30 mg/kg i.p.) causes a dose related fall in rectal temperature in guinea pigs which previous studies have shown to be blocked by the non-selective 5-HT(1B/D) receptor antagonist GR-127935 (N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl) [1,1'biphenyl]-4-carboxamide oxalate). The present study shows that the hypothermic response to SKF-99101H is dose-dependently blocked by SB-224289G (1'-methyl-5-(2'-methyl-4'-[(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)bipheny l-4-yl]carbonyl)-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrospiro[furo[2,3-f]indole-3,4'-pi peridone] hemioxalate) (0.3-10.0 mg/kg p.o.) (ED50 3.62 mg/kg), which is the first compound to be described which is more than 60 fold selective for the 5-HT1B receptor over the 5-HT1D receptor. SB-216641A (N-[3-(2-dimethylamino) ethoxy-4-methoxy-phenyl] 2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4-car boxamide hydrochloride) (0.6-20.0 mg/kg i.p.), which is somewhat less selective (30 fold) for the 5-HT1B receptor over the 5-HT1D receptor had a similar effect (ED50 4.43 mg/kg). The brain penetrant 5-HT1D selective receptor antagonist, BRL-15572 (4-(3-chlorophenyl)-alpha-(diphenylmethyl)-1-piperazineethanol+ ++ dihydrochloride) (0.3-100.0 mg/kg i.p.) was inactive. When administered alone neither BRL-15572 (0.1-10 mg/kg i.p.) nor SB-224289G (2.2-22 mg/kg p.o.) had an effect on body temperature. These data demonstrate that 5-HT1B (formerly 5-HT(1D beta)) and not 5-HT1D (formerly 5-HT(1D alpha)) receptors mediate the hypothermic response to SKF-99101H (30 mg/kg i.p.) in guinea pigs. The compounds described are useful pharmacological tools for distinguishing responses to 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors.
