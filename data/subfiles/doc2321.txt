Clement, H. W., et al. (1992). "Serotonin-norepinephrine interactions: a voltammetric study on the effect of serotonin receptor stimulation followed in the N. raphe dorsalis and the Locus coeruleus of the rat." J Neural Transm Gen Sect 88(1): 11-23.

	In vivo voltammetry with carbon fibre electrodes was used to study the effect of the serotoninergic (5-HT) neuronal system on the noradrenergic (NE) system in the Locus coeruleus of the rat. The voltammetric DOPAC signal in the Locus coeruleus, used as a measure of NE neuronal activity, was increased after systemic application of the 5-HT1B agonist CGS-12066B, the 5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin, and, to a lesser extent, by ipsapirone, a 5-HT1A agonist. The findings suggest that the NE neuronal system of the Locus coeruleus is stimulated by 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor activation and inhibited by 5-HT2 receptors. Likewise the 5-HT releaser and uptake inhibitor fenfluramine increased the DOPAC level in the Locus coeruleus. In contrast to the 5-HT1 agonists, which reduced 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the Nucleus raphe dorsalis, ritanserin increased the 5-HIAA signal in this nucleus. This finding could help to explain the action of ritanserin as sleep-modulating substance.
