	Neuroendocrine responses to administration of serotonin releasing agents or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 1A receptor agonists have been used as an index of serotonin receptor function in patients with depression and other mood disorders. However, the receptor population that mediates these responses has not been clearly identified. We tested the hypothesis that 5-HT1A receptors in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) mediate the release of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) and oxytocin after administration of a selective 5-HT1A agonist in conscious rats. Low-dose infusion (1 nmol/100 nl/side) of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY100635 (WAY; [O-methyl-3H]-N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl) ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamidetrihydrochloride), into the PVN blocked the rise in ACTH and oxytocin stimulated by low-dose (30 nmol/kg) i.v. administration of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 274 +/- 53 versus 70 +/- 20 pg/ml, P < 0.01 for ACTH and 10.7 +/- 3.4 versus 4.6 +/- 0.7 pg/ml, P < 0.05 for oxytocin after saline or WAY pretreatment, respectively). WAY did not influence the bradycardic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (-56 +/- 7 versus -54 +/- 6 beats per minute after saline or WAY). 8-OH-DPAT treatment also elicited locomotor activation followed by hind limb abduction and flat body posture. Surprisingly, WAY attenuated some aspects of locomotor activation and reduced the duration of hind limb abduction elicited by the agonist (5.1 +/- 0.9 versus 0.3 +/- 0.3 min for saline- or WAY-treated rats). These data indicate that 5-HT1A receptor stimulation in the PVN mediates the characteristic neuroendocrine response to serotonin agonist challenge. Moreover, they provide the first evidence that aspects of the behavioral serotonin syndrome are mediated by forebrain hypothalamic receptors.
