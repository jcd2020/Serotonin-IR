	N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells were used to study the influence of ethanol on the 5-HT- and veratridine-induced influx of 14C-guanidinium via the 5-HT3 receptor channel and the fast sodium channel, respectively. Ethanol (10-100 mM) concentration-dependently increased the 5-HT-induced 14C-guanidinium influx, leaving the basal and veratridine (100 microM)-induced influx unaffected. The increasing effect of ethanol (100 mM) was observed at all 5-HT concentrations investigated; accordingly, ethanol increased the maximum response to 5-HT. Whereas in the absence of ethanol the concentration-response curve for 5-HT was bell-shaped, this was no longer the case when ethanol (100 mM) was present in the incubation buffer; the descending branch of the concentration-response curve for 5-HT at concentrations above 300 microM was virtually no longer observed. When, in the presence of substance P (10 microM) the 5-HT-induced 14C-guanidinium influx was already enhanced, the ability of ethanol (100 mM) to increase the 5-HT-induced influx was considerably diminished (by 72%). Preincubation of N1E-115 cells with 5-HT caused a decay of the subsequent 5-HT response ("desensitization") which was dependent on the duration of preincubation; ethanol (100 mM) did not affect the rate of this decay of the 5-HT response. The 5-HT (30 microM)-induced 14C-guanidinium influx was also increased by methanol (100 mM) and n-propanol (100 mM). The rank order of the increasing effect of the n-alkanols (at 100 mM) was: methanol < ethanol < n-propanol; i.e. the degree of enhancement increased with the lipophilicity of the alcohols.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
