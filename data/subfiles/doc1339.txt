Brikas, P., et al. (1993). "CENTRAL AND PERIPHERAL SEROTONERGIC INFLUENCES ON VISCEROVISCERAL INHIBITORY REFLEX DURING DUODENAL DISTENSION IN SHEEP." Digestive Diseases and Sciences 38(6): 1079-1086.

	The effects of duodenal distension on forestomach and abomasal motility were investigated in conscious sheep chronically fitted with intraparietal electrodes, a duodenal cannula, and an intracerebroventricular cannula. Duodenal distensions with a balloon inflated with 40 ml (DD40) of water reduced the frequency of forestomach and abomasal contractions by 45 and 32%, respectively, while distension with 80 ml (DD80) induced a total inhibition. Methysergide, a mixed 5HT1-5HT2 antagonist administered intravenously (200 pg/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (20 mug/kg) suppressed the DD40-induced inhibition and reduced that induced by DD80. Spiroxatrine, a selective 5HT1A antagonist, intravenously (100 pg/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (10 pg/kg), suppressed the DD40 and DD80-induced inhibition, which was also attenuated by the 5HT2 antagonist ritanserin given intravenously (200 pg/kg) or intracerebroventricularly (20 mug/kg). Granisetron, a 5HT3 antagonist, injected intravenously (150 mug/kg), abolished the effects of DD40 and DD80 while it had no antagonistic action on DD40 and DD80 when given intracerebroventricularly (15 pg/kg). It is concluded that in sheep, duodenal distension inhibits forestomach and abomasal motility through 5HT14 and 5HT2 receptors at the level of the central nervous system and 5HT3 receptors located peripherally.
