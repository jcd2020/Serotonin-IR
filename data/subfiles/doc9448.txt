	A serotonergic dysfunction in the brain has been reported to be involved in suicidal behavior independently of the presence of a specific psychiatric disorder. Serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors are known to be located on serotonergic nerve terminals and to be involved in the presynaptic regulation of serotonin release. Genetic factors partly explain the risks for suicide, and a suicide completion group is thought to be more uniform than a suicide attempt group. To explore the hypothesis that the 5-HT1A receptor-induced serotonergic dysfunction is implicated genetically in suicide, we focused on the structural polymorphisms, Pro16Leu and Gly272Asp, of the 5-HT1A receptor gene, and examined the association between suicide victims who completed suicide and these two polymorphisms. In both polymorphisms, we found no significant difference in genotype distribution or allele frequencies between suicide victims and controls. These findings suggest that neither of these two polymorphisms is associated with suicide victims and it is unlikely that the 5-HT1A receptor gene is implicated in the susceptibility to suicide.
