	Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a long-term adverse effect of antipsychotic drugs that are dopamine D2 receptor blockers.' Serotonin receptor antagonism has been proposed as a common mechanism contributing to the low extrapyramidal effects profile of atypical antipsychotic drugs.(2) We examined the association of three polymorphisms in the 5-HT2A receptor gene (HTR2A) with TD susceptibility--T102C(3) and his452tyr(4) in the coding region and A-1438G(5) in the promoter--in matched schizophrenia patients with (n = 59, SCZ-TD-Y) and without TD (n = 62, SCZ-TD-N) and normal control subjects (n = 96). The T102C and the A-1438G polymorphisms are in complete linkage disequilibrium but not his452tyr. There was a significant excess of 102C and -1438G alleles (62.7%) in the SCZ-TD-Y patients compared to SCZ-TD-N patients (41.1%) and controls (45.9%; chi (2) = 12.8, df = 2, P= 0.002; SCZ-TD-Y vs SCZ-TD-N, chi (2) = 11.4, df = 1, P= 0.0008, OR 2.41, 95% Cl 1.43-3.99) and of 102CC and -1438GG genotypes (SCZ-TD-Y 42.4%, SCZ-TD-N, 16.1%, controls 20.8%, chi (2) = 13.3, df = 4, P = 0.01). The 102CC and the -1438GG genotypes were associated with significantly higher AIMS trunk dyskinesia scores (F = 3.9; df = 2, 116; P = 0.02) and more incapacitation (F = 5.0; df = 2, 115; P= 0.006). The his452tyr polymorphism showed no association with TD. These findings suggest that the 5-HT2A receptor gene is significantly associated with susceptibility to TD in patients with chronic schizophrenia. Previously reported association of the T102C and A-1438G polymorphisms with schizophrenia(6) may reflect association of a sub-group of patients with a susceptibility to abnormal involuntary movements related to antipsychotic drug exposure.
