Millan, M. J., et al. (2004). "S32504, a novel naphtoxazine agonist at dopamine D3/D2 receptors: I. Cellular, electrophysiological, and neurochemical profile in comparison with ropinirole." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 309(3): 903-920.

	S32504 [(+)-trans-3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-9-carbamoyl-4-propyl-2H-naphth[1,2-b]-1,4-oxa zine] displayed marked affinity for cloned, human (h)D(3) receptors (pK(i), 8.1) at which, in total G-protein ([(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)-triphosphate), Galpha(i3) (antibody capture/scintillation proximity), and mitogen-activated protein kinase (immunoblot) activation procedures, it behaved as an agonist: pEC(50) values, 8.7, 8.6, and 8.5, respectively. These actions were blocked by haloperidol and the selective D(3) receptor antagonist S33084 [(3aR,9bS)-N-[4-(8-cyano-1,3a,4,9b-tetrahydro-3H-benzopyrano[3,4-c]pyrrole-2-yl)- butyl]-(4-phenyl) benzamide)]. S32504 showed lower potency at hD(2S) and hD(2L) receptors in [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding (pEC(50) values, 6.4 and 6.7) and antibody capture/scintillation proximity (hD(2L), pEC(50), 6.6) procedures. However, reflecting signal amplification, it potently stimulated hD(2L) receptor-coupled mitogen-activated protein kinase (pEC(50), 8.6). These actions were blocked by haloperidol and the selective D(2) receptor antagonist L741,626 [4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-ol]. The affinity of S32504 for hD(4) receptors was low (5.3) and negligible for hD(1) and hD(5) receptors (pK(i), <5.0). S32504 showed weak agonist properties at serotonin(1A) ([(35)S]GTPgammaS binding, pEC(50), 5.0) and serotonin(2A) (G(q), pEC(50), 5.2) receptors and low affinity for other (>50) sites. In anesthetized rats, S32504 (0.0025-0.01 mg/kg, i.v.) suppressed electrical activity of ventrotegmental dopaminergic neurons. Correspondingly, S32504 (0.0025-0.63 mg/kg, s.c.) potently reduced dialysis levels (and synthesis) of dopamine in striatum, nucleus accumbens, and frontal cortex of freely moving rats, actions blocked by haloperidol and L741,626 but not by S33084. In contrast, S32504 only weakly inhibited serotonergic transmission and failed to affect noradrenergic transmission. Actions of S32504 were expressed stereospecifically versus its less active enantiomer S32601 [(-)-trans-3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-9-carbomoyl-4-propyl-2H-naphth[1,2-b]-1,4-oxa zine]. Although the D(3)/D(2) agonist and antiparkinsonian agent ropinirole mimicked the profile of S32504, it was less potent. In conclusion, S32504 is a potent and selective agonist at dopamine D(3) and D(2) receptors.
