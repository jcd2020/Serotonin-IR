Moy, S. S., et al. (2004). "Effect of acute and chronic olanzapine treatment on phencyclidine-induced behavioral sensitization in rats with neonatal dopamine loss." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 78(1): 47-56.

	In agreement with previous work, adult rats given selective lesions to dopamine (DA)-containing neurons as neonates exhibited a greater behavioral sensitization to repeated phencyclidine (PCP) treatment in comparison to sham-lesioned controls. Acute administration of olanzapine (1-5 mg/kg ip) or clozapine (15 mg/kg ip) decreased sensitized PCP-induced activity in both lesioned and control animals. Acute haloperidol (0.5 mg/kg ip) had no impact on PCP responsiveness in lesioned animals, but significantly antagonized PCP effects in sham-lesioned controls. Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A/5-HT2C-receptor antagonist, significantly reduced PCP activation in both lesioned and control rats, suggesting that the efficacy of atypical antipsychoticsagainst PCP-induced sensitized responses may be mediated by one of the 5-HT2-receptor subtypes. A 6-week chronic regimen of orally administered olanzapine, clozapine, or haloperidol failed to block the sensitization induced by repeated PCP exposure. However, a 10-month oral olanzapme treatment significantly blunted the behavioral sensitization to repeated PCP exposure in lesioned animals, even after withdrawal from chronic olanzapine for more than 3 weeks. A 10-month oral haloperidol treatment had no effect on the sensitization induced by repeated PCP dosing. The persistent effect of chronic olanzapine administration on PCP sensitization may be relevant to the chronic therapeutic efficacy of atypical antipsychotics treating schizophrenia-a clinical syndrome linked to enhanced sensitivity to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor antagonists.
