Layer, R. T., et al. (1992). "EFFECT OF SEROTONERGIC AGONISTS IN THE NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS ON D-AMPHETAMINE-STIMULATED LOCOMOTION." Life Sci 50(11): 813-820.

	Serotonergic projections from the raphe nuclei are thought to modulate locomotor activity in the rat, and serotonin injection into the nucleus accumbens attenuates the hypermotility elicited by amphetamine. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the effects of various classes of serotonergic agonists administered into the nucleus accumbens on d-amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity in order to determine which serotonin receptor subtypes are involved. Administration of the nonselective 5-HT agonist quipazine, the 5-HT-1 agonist mCPP, the 5-HT-1a agonist 8-OH-DPAT, the 5-HT-1b agonist CGS-12066B, and the 5HT-1c/2 agonist DOI did not inhibit d-amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity. Pronounced lateral head weaving was noted after 8-OH-DPAT administration. The combination of the 5-HT-1a agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the 5-HT-1b agonist CGS-12066B, however, did inhibit d-amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity. In contrast, the 5-HT-3 agonist 1-phenylbiguanide enhanced the locomotor effect of d-amphetamine. This effect was partially reversed by the 5-HT-3 antagonist MDL-7222. These studies suggest that serotonin has complex and multiple effects on the regulation of locomotor activity within the nucleus accumbens.
