	Although serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is known to exert a modulatory action on cerebellar function, our current knowledge of the nature of receptor subtypes mediating serotonergic activity in this part of the brain remains fragmentary. In this study, we report the presence and distribution of 5-HT3, 5-HT5A and 5-HT7 receptor-like immunoreactivity in the rat cerebellum using immunofluorescence histochemistry. 5-HT3 immunoreactivity was found in fibers sparsely distributed throughout the cerebellum. Most of them were seen in the cerebellar cortex as fine varicose 5-HT3-positive axonal processes. 5-HT5A immunoreactivity, on the other hand, was observed in neuronal somata of the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. Based upon cell morphology and the use of cell-specific markers, Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons and Golgi cells were found to be 5-HT5A immunopositive. In addition, the use of cell-specific markers allowed LIS to identify previously reported large 5-HT2A-positive cells in the granular layer as being Golgi cells. Finally, 5-HT7 immunoreactivity was observed only in Purkinje cells. Corroborating previous radioligand-binding, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies, our data relate serotonin receptor subtypes to specific cerebellar cell types and may consequently contribute to the elucidation of serotonergic actions in the cerebellum.
