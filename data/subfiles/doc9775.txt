	Acute 17 beta-estradiol treatment had been shown to downregulate the 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression in limbic areas of the female rat brain. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of chronic 17 beta-estradiol treatment on 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression and 5-HT1A receptor binding in ovariectomized female rats. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, no alterations were found on the 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels after the estradiol treatment (2 weeks). Radioligand autoradiographic studies using the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist [H-3]WAY-100635 revealed reduced receptor binding in the amygdala, hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and motor cortex after estradiol treatment, whereas no changes were observed in the piriform or retrosplenial cortex. Thus, the previous findings together with the present results indicate that estradiol-induced alterations in 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression appears within hours, but diminishes with chronic treatment when significant changes on the receptor-protein level are apparent. The effects of estradiol treatment on the 5-HT1A receptor binding in the limbic areas suggest that estrogen can modulate functions such as learning, memory, cognition, emotional processing, and social behavior. Consequently, estradiol modulation of 5-HT1A receptor circuits might be a possible pathway for the estrogen influence in the expression of psychiatric and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, affective disorders, and schizophrenia.
