Monti, J. M., et al. (1999). "Effects of accumbens m-chlorophenylbiguanide microinjections on sleep and waking in intact and 6-hydroxydopamine-treated rats." Eur J Pharmacol 364(2-3): 89-98.

	Effects of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist, m-chlorophenylbiguanide (10.0-40.0 microg), on sleep and waking were studied in control, vehicle-treated and 6-hydroxydopamine-injected rats. Bilateral injections of m-chlorophenylbiguanide into the nucleus accumbens of the control and the vehicle-infused animals significantly increased waking and reduced slow wave sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep) remained unchanged. Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, MDL 72222 (1aH,3a,5a, H-tropan-3-yl-3,5-dichloro-benzoate) (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.), reversed the effects of m-chlorophenylbiguanide (10.0-20.0 microg) on sleep and waking in the control group. Administration of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist to the 6-hydroxydopamine-treated animals modified only slightly the time spent in wakefulness and slow wave sleep, while REM sleep was significantly and dose dependently reduced. Our findings further support the proposal that increase of wakefulness and reduction of slow wave sleep after activation of 5-HT3 receptors, is partly related to the release of endogenous dopamine.
