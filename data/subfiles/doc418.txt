	In this study, drug inhibition and saturation experiments on the binding of the highly selective 5-HT4 antagonist [3H]GR 113808 were performed in human brain membranes so as to better characterize this binding site. Drug competition studies were carried out by incubating 0.2 nM [3H]GR 113808 in the presence of increasing concentrations of six different drugs, i.e. 5-HT, 5-CT, ondansetron, tropisetron, BIMU 1 and BIMU 8 (mixed 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 agonists). The binding displaced by 5-HT showed a drug inhibition constant (Ki) value of 197nM. The use of 5-CT or ondansetron also showed the existence of single-site models albeit with Ki values in the micromolar range (11,5 microM). Tropisetron, BIMU 1 and BIMU 8 displaced bound [3H]GR 113808 according to a two-site binding model, with the high affinity component in the nanomolar range and the low affinity site in the micro or milimolar range. Saturation experiments revealed high binding densities in basal ganglia (187 fmol/mg in putamen, and 149 fmol/mg in caudate nucleus), while lower densities were observed in cortical regions (49 fmol/mg in temporal cortex, 45 fmol/mg in parietal cortex and 71 fmol/mg in cingulate cortex). The apparent affinity (Kd) was similar in the brain regions studied, ranging from 0.13 to 0.34 nmol/l. Despite the enrichment of 5-HT receptors in human brain, their functional correlate in brain diseases remains to be clarified.
