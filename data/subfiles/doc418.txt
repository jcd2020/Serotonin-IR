Ashby, C. R., Jr., et al. (2013). "Electrophysiological evidence for rapid 5-HT₁A autoreceptor inhibition by vilazodone, a 5-HT₁A receptor partial agonist and 5-HT reuptake inhibitor." Eur J Pharmacol 714(1-3): 359-365.

	This study examined the effect of vilazodone, a combined serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT(1A) receptor partial agonist, paroxetine and fluoxetine on the sensitivity of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors of serotonergic dorsal raphe nucleus neurons in rats. These effects were assessed by determining the intravenous dose of (±)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) required to suppress the basal firing rate of these neurons by 50% (ID₅₀) in anesthetized rats using in vivo electrophysiology. 5-HT uptake inhibition was determined by the ability of the compounds to reverse (±)-p-chloroamphetamine (PCA)-induced rat hypothalamic 5-HT depletion ex vivo. Acute vilazodone administration (0.63 and 2.1 µmol/kg, s.c.), compared with vehicle, significantly increased (2-3-fold) the ID₅₀ of 8-OH-DPAT at 4 h, but not 24h after administration. Subchronic administration (3 days) significantly increased the ID₅₀ value at 4 h (3-4-fold) and at 24 h (~2-fold). In contrast, paroxetine and fluoxetine at doses that were supramaximal for 5-HT uptake inhibition did not significantly alter the ID₅₀ value of 8-OH-DPAT after acute or subchronic administration. Vilazodone antagonized the action of PCA 3.5 h and 5 h after a single dose (ID₅₀ 1.49 and 0.46 µmol/kg, s.c., respectively), but was inactive 18 h post-administration, corroborating the electrophysiological results at 24 h following acute administration. The results are consistent with the concept of rapid and, following repeated treatment, prolonged inhibition of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors by vilazodone. This effect could occur by either direct interaction with, or desensitization of, these receptors, an effect which cannot be ascribed to vilazodone's 5-HT reuptake inhibiting properties.
