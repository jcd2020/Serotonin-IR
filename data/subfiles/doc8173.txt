Nirogi, R. V., et al. (2015). "Design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of indolylsulfonamide amines as potent and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists." J Enzyme Inhib Med Chem 30(1): 85-97.

	A series of N'-[3-(indole-1-sulfonyl) aryl]-N,N-dimethyl ethane-1,2-diamines and N'-[3-(indole-1-sulfonyl) aryl]-N,N-dimethyl propane-1,3-diamines was designed and synthesized as 5-HT6 receptor ligands. These compounds, when screened in a functional reporter gene-based assay, displayed potent antagonistic activity with Kb values in the range of 1.8-60â€‰nM. The lead compound 9y has shown good ADME surrogate properties, acceptable pharmacokinetic profile and is active in animal models of cognition like novel object recognition test and Morris water maze. It was selected for detailed profiling.
