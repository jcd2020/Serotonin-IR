Miryala, C. S. J., et al. (2011). "Fluoxetine prevents 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperphagia in Fischer inbred rats." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 98(2): 311-315.

	Ovariectomized, Fischer rats were hormonally primed with 10 mu g estradiol benzoate and 50 mu g progesterone or were treated with the sesame seed oil vehicle. Food intake was measured 2 h and 24 h after treatment with 0.25 mg/kg of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, (+/-)-8-hydroxy 2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), 5 mg/kg of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, or their combination. Consistent with prior studies, two hour food intake of rats given fluoxetine and 8-OH-DPAT did not differ from vehicle controls. 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperphagia, evident at 2 h, was blocked by co-treatment with fluoxetine. However, in contrast to prior studies, 5 mg/kg fiuoxetine, alone, had only modest effects on food intake. Differences in our experimental protocols and/or the strain of rat may account for the lower anorectic response to fluoxetine. Nevertheless, the absence of a significant response to fluoxetine, alone, coupled with the drug's attenuation of the hyperphagic effect of 8-OH-DPAT, leads to the suggestion that the behavioral response to the combined treatment is more complex than that of simple additivity. Consistent with this suggestion, 24 h food intake of rats given 8-OH-DPAT and fluoxetine was lower than that of vehicle or 8-OH-DPAT-treated rats. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
