Gothert, M., et al. (1987). "Effects of RU 24969 on serotonin release in rat brain cortex: further support for the identity of serotonin autoreceptors with 5-HT1B sites." Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther 288(1): 31-42.

	Rat brain cortex slices and synaptosomes preincubated with [3H] serotonin were used to study the effects of the 5-HT1 receptor agonist RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole) on the electrically (3 Hz) evoked 3H overflow from superfused slices and the potassium (12 mmol/l)-evoked 3H overflow from superfused synaptosomes. In slices superfused in the presence of 6-nitroquipazine (an inhibitor of serotonin uptake), the electrically evoked overflow was inhibited by RU 24969 and the reference compound serotonin (maximum inhibition obtainable: by about 50 and 60%, respectively; IC25 and IC30: 33 and 150 nmol/l, respectively). The inhibitory effect of RU 24969 on the evoked overflow was attenuated by cyanopindolol (a beta-adrenoceptor blocker with antagonistic properties at 5-HT1 receptors). In the absence of 6-nitroquipazine, RU 24969 did not increase the basal efflux and tended to be more potent in inhibiting the evoked overflow than in the presence of 6-nitroquipazine. The correlation of the release-inhibiting potencies of serotonin receptor agonists with their affinities for 5-HT1B binding sites (Engel et al., 1986) was slightly improved by inclusion of RU 24969, whereas that with the affinities for 5-HT1A binding sites (which was worse than the former correlation) was not changed. In synaptosomes superfused in the presence of 6-nitroquipazine, RU 24969 inhibited the potassium-evoked overflow. The inhibitory effect of RU 24969 was antagonized by cyanopindolol, which by itself did not affect the evoked overflow. It is concluded that RU 24969 acts as a highly potent agonist (with an intrinsic activity of about 0.8) at the presynaptic serotonin autoreceptor in the rat brain cortex. Furthermore, the present results support the assumption that these receptors belong to the 5-HT1B subtype.
