Tai, C. F., et al. (2006). "Suppression of bladder reflex activity in chronic spinal cord injured cats by activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors." Experimental Neurology 199(2): 427-437.

	The effects of 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A receptor agonist) and WAY100635 (5-HTIA receptor antagonist) on reflex bladder activity were investigated in a-chloralose anesthetized or conscious chronic spinal cord injured cats. The results were similar in both anesthetized and conscious animals. Cystometrograms revealed that 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly increased the bladder volume threshold for eliciting a large amplitude micturition contraction, but only slightly reduced the amplitude of the contractions and did not alter the small amplitude pre-micturition contractions. 8-OH-DPAT also reduced the amplitude of isovolumetric bladder contractions. The inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT was reversed by WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg) or blocked by pre-treatment with WAY100635. Reflex bladder contractions evoked by tactile stimulation of the perigenital region were not altered by S-OH-DPAT. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT is mediated by an action on interneuronal pathways in the spinal cord or on the C-fiber afferent limb of the spinal micturition reflex and not on bladder smooth muscle or the efferent limb of the reflex pathway. Drugs that activate 5-HTIA receptors might be useful in treating detrusor overactivity after spinal cord injury. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
