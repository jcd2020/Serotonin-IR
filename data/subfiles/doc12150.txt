Yoshioka, M., et al. (1995). "EFFECTS OF CONDITIONED FEAR STRESS ON 5-HT RELEASE IN THE RAT PREFRONTAL CORTEX." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 51(2-3): 515-519.

	The effects of conditioned fear stress (CFS) on 5-HT release in the medial prefrontal cortex were studied by in vivo microdialysis. CFS (exposure to an environment in which foot-shock had been delivered previously) induced a marked suppression of motility-that is, freezing behavior. The extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the medial prefrontal cortex increased during this freezing behavior, but no significant changes were observed in the concentration of its metabolite, 5-HIAA. The increased 5-HT concentration returned to pretreatment levels when the animals were returned to their home cages. Diazepam (0.5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) reduced the CFS-induced freezing behavior and prevented the increases in extracellular 5-HT levels. A 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, tropisetron (10 and 100 mu g/kg), also inhibited both the CFS-induced increase in 5-HT release and the freezing behavior. These findings suggest that there is a relationship between anxiety and 5-HT release in the prefrontal cortex and that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist tropisetron might have anxiolytic properties.
