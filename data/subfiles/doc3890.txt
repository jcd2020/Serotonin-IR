	The effects of 2-(4-(4-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinyl)-butyl)-1,2-benzoisothiazol- 3(2H)one-1, 1-dioxide hydrochloride (isapirone, TVX Q 7821), a putative 5-HT1 receptor antagonist, has been studied on various models of 5-HT receptor sub-type function. In mice TVX Q 7821 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the hypothermia induced by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) with an ED50 of 5.3 mg/kg suggesting that TVX Q 7821 was an antagonist of the presynaptic (possibly somato-dendritic) 5-HT1A receptor. TVX Q 7821 did not alter the locomotor response to the suggested 5-HT1B agonist RU 24969. The rate of mouse brain 5-HT synthesis was accelerated by TVX Q 7821 (10 mg/kg). 5-HT2 receptor-mediated head twitch behaviour induced by precursor loading with 5-HTP was unaffected by TVX Q 7821 (10 mg/kg) pretreatment 75 min earlier, but the head-twitch induced by the agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine was enhanced by prior treatment with TVX Q 7821. In rats the hypothermia induced by 8-OH-DPAT was partially antagonised by TVX Q 7821 while the behavioural "serotonin syndrome" induced by 8-OH-DPAT (a possible post-synaptic 5-HT1B-mediated effect) was unaffected by TVX Q 7821 as was the locomotion induced by RU 24969. The data suggest that TVX Q 7821 is a good presynaptic 5-HT1A antagonist in mice, as indicated by the 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia and 5-HT synthesis rate studies. It did not antagonise 5-HT1B-mediated behaviour in mice or rats and appeared to have an antagonist action at pre- but not post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in rats.
