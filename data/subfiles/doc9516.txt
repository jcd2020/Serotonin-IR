	In the presence of a 30 nM prazosin mask, [3H]-2-(2,6-dimethoxyphenoxyethyl) aminomethyl-1,4-benzodioxane ([3H]WB4101) can selectively label 5-HT1 serotonin receptors. Serotonin exhibits high affinity (Ki = 2.5 nM) and monophasic competition for [3H] WB4101 binding in cerebral cortex. Furthermore, we have found a significant correlation (r = 0.96) between the affinities of a number of serotonergic and nonserotonergic compounds at [3H]WB4101-binding sites in the presence of 30 nM prazosin and [3H] lysergic acid diethylamide ([3H]LSD)-labeled 5-HT1 serotonin receptors in homogenates of rat cerebral cortex. Despite similar pharmacological profiles, distribution studies indicate that, in the presence of 5 mM MgSO4, the Bmax of [3H]WB4101 is significantly lower than the Bmax of [3H]LSD in various brain regions. WB4101 competition for [3H] LSD-labeled 5-HT1 receptors fits best to a computer-derived model assuming two binding sites, with the KH for WB4101 being similar to the KD of [3H]WB4101 binding derived from saturation experiments. This suggests that [3H]WB4101 labels only one of the subtypes of the 5-HT1 serotonin receptors labeled by [3H]LSD. Interestingly, the selective 5-HT1A serotonin receptor antagonist, spiperone, and the selective 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetraline, exhibit high affinity and monophasic competition for [3H]WB4101 but compete for multiple [3H]LSD 5-HT1 binding sites. These data indicate that [3H]WB4101 selectively labels the 5-HT1A serotonin receptor, whereas [3H] LSD appears to label both the 5-HT1A and the 5-HT1B serotonin receptor subtypes. The divalent cations, Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ were found to markedly increase the affinity and Bmax of [3H]WB4101 binding in cerebral cortex. Conversely, the guanine nucleotides guanylylimidodiphosphate and GTP, but not the adenosine nucleotide ATP, markedly reduce the Bmax of [3H]WB4101 binding. These characteristics are typical of agonists interacting with receptors which modulate cellular function via a guanine nucleotide-regulatory subunit.
