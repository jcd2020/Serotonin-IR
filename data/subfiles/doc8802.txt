	The discriminative stimulus properties of the atypical antipsychotic drug (APD) clozapine (CLZ) have recently been studied in C57BL/6 mice, a common background strain for genetic alterations. However, further evaluation is needed to fully characterize CLZ's discriminative cue in this strain of mice. The objectives of the study were to confirm the previous findings using a shorter pretreatment time and to further characterize the receptor mechanisms mediating the discriminative stimulus properties of CLZ by testing APDs, selective ligands, and N-desmethylclozapine (CLZ's major metabolite) in C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 male mice were trained to discriminate 2.5 mg/kg CLZ (s.c.) from vehicle in a two-lever drug discrimination task. Generalization testing with CLZ yielded an ED50 = 1.19 mg/kg. Substitution testing with APDs showed that the atypical APDs quetiapine, sertindole, zotepine, iloperidone, and melperone fully substituted for CLZ (a parts per thousand yen80% CLZ-appropriate responding), but aripiprazole did not. The typical APDs chlorpromazine and thioridazine substituted for CLZ (fluphenazine and perphenazine did not). The serotonin (5-HT) (2A) antagonist M100907 and the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin fully substituted for CLZ. The H-1 histaminergic antagonist pyrilamine, dopamine agonist amphetamine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine did not substitute for CLZ. While N-desmethylclozapine did not substitute for CLZ when tested alone, N-desmethylclozapine plus a low dose of CLZ combined in an additive manner produced full substitution. CLZ's discriminative cue in C57BL/6 mice is a "compound" cue mediated in part by antagonism of 5-HT2A and alpha(1) receptors.
