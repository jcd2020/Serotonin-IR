	Serotonin (5-HT) may be inhibitory to micturition at a spinal level. A potential mechanism of action for serotonergic inhibition of bladder function is a depression of the ascending limb of the supraspinal reflex mediating micturition. Ascending activity evoked by pelvic nerve stimulation was recorded in the thoracic spinal cord of anesthetized cats. For comparison, spinal reflex activity evoked by pelvic nerve stimulation was recorded on the pudendal nerve. The effects of intrathecal administration of serotonergic agents were examined to determine whether spinal and supraspinal responses to bladder afferent activation were modulated by 5-HT. Methysergide (60 nmol), a non-selective serotonergic antagonist, increased ascending activity by 61+/-7% and depressed spinal reflex activity by 38+/-6%. Zatosetron (10 nmol), a 5-HT3 antagonist had a similar effect on both activities (increased by 93+/-24% and decreased by 77+/-7%, respectively). The effect on ascending activity of blocking 5-HT3 receptors was also confirmed with ICS 205930 and MDL 72222. 2-Methyl-5-HT (800 nmol), a 5-HT3 agonist, depressed ascending activity to 46+/-9% of control, but enhanced spinal reflex activity by 73+/-92%. These results demonstrate that stimulation of 5-HT3 and methysergide-sensitive 5-HT receptors can inhibit ascending activity and facilitate spinal reflex activity elicited by activation of bladder afferents. It is suggested that descending serotonergic pathways may participate in the spinal coordination of urinary continence.
