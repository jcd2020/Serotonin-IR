Albert, P. R., et al. (1996). "The 5HT1A receptor: Signaling, desensitization, and gene transcription." Neuropsychopharmacology 14(1): 19-25.

	The hypothesis that antianxiety or antidepressant agents (e.g., 5-HT1A agonists, 5-HT uptake blockers) exert their clinical actions via enhancement of serotonergic neurotransmission due to desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors predicts that regulation of this receptor plays a crucial role in the therapeutic actions of these agents. A multidisciplinary strategy is described for the characterization of the 5-HT1A receptor at the level of cellular signaling mechanisms and genetic regulation, using heterologous expression of the cloned receptor in cell lines, site-directed mutagenesis, isolation of receptor-positive neuronal cell lines, and promoter analysis of the 5-HT1A receptor gene. These analyses will yield new insights into the possible mechanisms down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptor signaling, and may suggest novel sites of inherent defect involved in anxiety syndromes or major depression.
