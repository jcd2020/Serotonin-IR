Waelbers, T., et al. (2013). "5-HT2A Receptors in the Feline Brain: I-123-5-I-R91150 Kinetics and the Influence of Ketamine Measured with Micro-SPECT." Journal of Nuclear Medicine 54(8): 1428-1433.

	Subanesthetic doses of ketamine can be used as a rapid-acting antidepressant in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Therefore, the brain kinetics of I-123-5-I-R91150 (4-amino-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl]-4-methylpiperidin-4-yl]-5-iodo-2-methoxy-benzamide) and the influence of ketamine on the postsynaptic serotonin-2A receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine-2A, or 5-HT2A) status were investigated in cats using micro-SPECT. Methods: This study was conducted on 6 cats using the radioligand I-123-5-I-R91150, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, as the imaging probe. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with a continuous-rate infusion of propofol (8.4 +/- 1.2 mg kg(-1) followed by 0.22 mg kg(-1) min(-1)) 75 min after tracer administration, and acquisition of the first image began 15 min after induction of anesthesia. After this first acquisition, propofol (0.22 mg kg(-1) min(-1)) was combined with ketamine (5 mg kg(-1) followed by 0.023 mg kg(-1) min(-1)), and the second acquisition began 15 min later. Semiquantification, with the cerebellum as a reference region, was performed to calculate the 5-HT2A receptor binding indices (parameter for available receptor density) in the frontal and temporal cortices. The binding indices were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed ranks statistics. Results: The addition of ketamine to the propofol continuous-rate infusion resulted in decreased binding indices in the right frontal cortex (1.25 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.16; P = 0.028), left frontal cortex (1.34 +/- 0.15 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.10; P = 0.028), right temporal cortex (1.30 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.09; P = 0.046), and left temporal cortex (1.41 +/- 0.20 vs. 1.52 +/-. 0.20; P = 0.046). Conclusion: This study showed that cats can be used as an animal model for studying alterations of the 5-HT2A receptor status with I-123-5-I-R91150 micro-SPECT. Furthermore, an interaction between ketamine and the 5-HT2A receptors resulting in decreased binding of I-123-5-I-R91150 in the frontal and temporal cortices was demonstrated. Whether the decreased radioligand binding resulted from a direct competition between ketamine and I-123-5-I-R91150 or from a decreased affinity of the 5-HT2A receptor caused by ketamine remains to be elucidated.
