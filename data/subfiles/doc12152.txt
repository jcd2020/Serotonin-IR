Yoshitake, T., et al. (2003). "Activation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors enhances the inhibitory effect of galanin on hippocampal 5-HT release in vivo." Neuropharmacology 44(2): 206-213.

	The microdialysis technique was used to examine interactions between 5-HT(1A) and galanin receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), by measuring the extracellular levels of 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus of awake rats. The rats were pretreated with the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (R,S)-8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.) or saline. 8-OH-DPAT caused a time-dependent reduction of basal 5-HT levels down to 43-48% at 40 min while at 140 min, the hippocampal 5-HT had returned to control values. At that time point, the rats received a second injection of 8-OH-DPAT or galanin (0.15, 0.5 and 1.5 nmol/0.5 microl) infused into the lateral ventricle. The second injection of 8-OH-DPAT caused a significantly smaller reduction of hippocampal 5-HT levels. In contrast, galanin at all three doses in the 8-OH-DPAT-pretreated groups, was significantly more potent in reducing 5-HT levels (maximal reduction to 74%, 52% and 49%, respectively) than it was in saline-pretreated rats (maximal reduction to 96%, 85% and 69%, respectively). The inhibitory effect of galanin (1.5 nmol) on extracellular 5-HT levels in the rat hippocampus was significantly attenuated by co-administration of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonists WAY-100635 (0.3 and 0.6 mg/kg s.c.) and, to a lesser extent, with pindolol (20 mg/kg s.c.). These data provide direct in vivo evidence of agonistic 5-HT(1A)-galanin receptor interaction at the presynaptic level. Furthermore, the findings indicate that a down-regulation of the somato-dendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, following their stimulation with 8-OH-DPAT and possibly also indirectly with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, may be compensated by a subsequent 'sensitization' of the inhibitory galanin receptors in the DRN. Thus, the enhanced galanin receptor-mediated inhibition of 5-HT neurotransmission may contribute to the pathophysiology of depression or to the reduced and delayed efficacy of antidepressant therapies.
