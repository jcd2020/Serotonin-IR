Fernandez, M. J., et al. (1995). "Structural, conformational, biochemical, and pharmacological study of some amides derived from 3,7-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo 3.3.1 nonan-9-amine as potential 5-HT3 receptor antagonists." Journal of Molecular Structure 372(2-3): 203-213.

	A series of amides derived from 3,7-dimethyl-3,7-diazabicyclo [3,3.1] nonan-9-amine have been synthesized and examined by H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy and the crystal structure of 9-(2,4,6-trichlorobenzamido)-3,7-dimethy 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1] nonane hydrochloride (4a . HCl) has been determined by X-ray diffraction. These compounds adopt an almost perfect chair-chair conformation with the N-CH3 groups in equatorial position. This conformation is nearly the same as that observed for compound 4a in the solid state. From binding studies of compounds 4a-c, compound 4b demonstrated the ability to efficiently displace [H-3]GR65630 bound to bovine brain area postrema membranes to an extent comparable to MDL 72222, In the von Bezold-Jarish reflex, compound 4b showed significant results at a dose of 25 mg Kg(-1). It is shown for the first time that a series of compounds with a bispidine skeleton linked through an amide moiety to several aromatic rings, shows 5-HT3 antagonistic profiles.
