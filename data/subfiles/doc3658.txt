Gauffre, J. C., et al. (1997). "Cortical H-3 ketanserin binding and 5-HT2A receptor-mediated inositol phosphate production in the spontaneously hypertensive rat and Lewis rat strains." Neuroscience Letters 236(2): 112-116.

	The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and Lewis rat strains differ in the elevated plus-maze of anxiety, the former and the latter strain displaying low and high anxiety, respectively. A recent study has shown that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)(2A) receptor-mediated head shakes, but not [H-3]ketanserin binding at these receptors, are less in Lewis rats, compared with SHRs, Herein, we have analysed the hypothesis of a difference in 5-HT2A receptor-effector coupling between these two strains. Confirming our previous results, the B-max and K-D values for the specific [H-3]ketanserin binding at cortical 5-HT2A receptors were respectively identical in both strains. The accumulation of total inositol phosphates by the 5-HT2A,2B,2C receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI; 0.01-100 mu M) was concentration-and strain (Lewis > SHR)-dependent. Preincubation with 0.01 and 0.1 mu M of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist SR 46349B, respectively, decreased and prevented DOI-elicited inositol phosphate production in both strains. The aforementioned genetic differences in 5-HT2A receptor-mediated head shakes may thus lie at some point distal from the 5-HT2A receptor. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.
