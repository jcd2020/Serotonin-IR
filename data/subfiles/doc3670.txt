	Corticosterone plays an important role in feeding behavior. However, its mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of corticosterone on feeding behavior. In this study, cumulative food intake was increased by acute corticosterone administration in a dose-dependent manner. Administration of the 5-HT(2c) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazin (mCPP) reversed the effect of corticosterone on food intake. The anorectic effects of mCPP were also blocked by the 5-HT(2c) receptor antagonist RS102221 in corticosterone-treated mice. Both corticosterone and mCPP increased c-Fos expression in hypothalamic nuclei, but not the nucleus of the solitary tract. RS102221 inhibited c-Fos expression induced by mCPP, but not corticosterone. In addition, mCPP had little effect on TH and POMC levels in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, mCPP antagonized decreasing effect of the leptin produced by corticosterone. Taken together, our findings suggest that 5-HT(2c) receptors and leptin may be involved in the effects of corticosterone-induced hyperphagia.
