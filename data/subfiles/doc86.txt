Ago, Y., et al. (2006). "Attenuation by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist osemozotan of the behavioral effects of single and repeated methamphetamine in mice." Neuropharmacology 51(4): 914-922.

	This study examined the effects of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist osemozotan on repeated methamphetamine (METH)-induced behavioral sensitization and single METH-induced locomotor stimulant effect in mice, and then the neurochemical mechanisms using in vivo microdialysis. Repeated administration of METH for 7 days enhanced METH challenge-induced locomotor activity, and this sensitization was observed even after its withdrawal for 7-14 days. Administration of osemozotan to METH-sensitized mice inhibited the maintenance of behavioral sensitization. This effect was blocked by a low dose of WAY100635, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. A METH challenge increased the extracellular levels of dopamine (DA), 5-HT, and noradrenaline in the prefrontal cortex, but only the increase in 5-HT release was enhanced by repeated METH administration. This augmented response of 5-HT release was attenuated by osemozotan in a WAY100635-sensitive way. A single administration of osemozotan to drug na√Øve mice inhibited METH-induced locomotor stimulant effect and reduced METH-induced increase in prefrontal 5-HT, but not DA, release. These results suggest that prefrontal 5-HT release is involved at least partly in the effects of osemozotan on single and repeated METH-induced behavioral effects in mice, and imply that the 5-HT1A receptors may have a potential therapeutic value in the remission of schizophrenia.
