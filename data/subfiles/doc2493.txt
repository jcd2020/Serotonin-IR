de Oliveira, R. L., et al. (2019). "Contribution of serotonergic and nitrergic pathways, as well as monoamine oxidase-a and Na+, K+-ATPase enzymes in antidepressant-like action of ((4-tert-butylcyclohexylidene) methyl) (4-methoxystyryl) sulfide (BMMS)." Metabolic Brain Disease 34(5): 1313-1324.

	The present study investigated a possible antidepressant-like effect of ((4-tert-butylcyclohexylidene)methyl) (4-methoxystyryl) sulfide (BMMS) by using the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST) in Swiss mice. The contribution of serotoninergic, glutamatergic and nitrergic systems in the antidepressant-like activity of BMMS was evaluated. We also examined the involvement of monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A, MAO-B and Na+, K+-ATPase activities in prefrontal cortex of mice. BMMS, (0.1-10 mg/kg, intragastrically (i.g.)) and fluoxetine (32 mg/kg, i.g.) decreased the immobility time in the FST and TST. The anti-immobility effect of BMMS (10 mg/kg, i.g.) in the TST was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneously (s.c.), a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist), ketanserin (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i.p.), a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist), and partially blocked by ondansetron (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist). The anti-immobility effect of BMMS (10 mg / kg, i.g.) was not avoided by pretreatment with MK-801 (0.01 mg/kg, s.c. a non-competitive N-methyl D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor) in the TST. Pretreatment with L-arginine (500 mg/kg, i.p., a nitric oxide precursor) reversed partially the reduction in the immobility time elicited by BMMS (10 mg/kg, i.g.) in TST. BMMS altered Na+,K+-ATPase and MAO-A activities in prefrontal cortex of mice, but was not able to change the MAO-B activity. In conclusion, BMMS exerted an antidepressant-like effect in mice and serotonergic and nitrergic systems are involved in the antidepressant-like action of compound. BMMS modulated MAO-A and Na+, K+- ATPase activities in prefrontal cortex of mice.
