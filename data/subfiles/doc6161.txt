	This chapter mill give personal accounts of the neural basis of male rat sexual behavior from two somewhat different perspectives, one tilted towards neuroanatomy (K.L.), and one tilted towards monoaminergic pharmacology (S.A.). Both perspectives were strongly influenced by the Zeitgeist, the former imperceptibly merging into the latter as relations between the neural substrate for monoaminergic neurotransmission was elucidated.(1)
