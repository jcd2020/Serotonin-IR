Peltier, R. and S. Schenk (1991). "GR38032F, A SEROTONIN 5-HT3 ANTAGONIST, FAILS TO ALTER COCAINE SELF-ADMINISTRATION IN RATS." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 39(1): 133-136.

	Recent data have supported a role for serotonin (5-HT) in the self-administration of cocaine by laboratory rats. More specifically, it has been suggested that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists may be useful in the treatment of drug abuse. To assess this possibility, we compared the effects of the 5-HT3 antagonist, GR38032F, with the dopamine D2 receptor blocker, haloperidol, on the intravenous self-administration of cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) in rats. The serotonin antagonist (0.01, 0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg, IP) failed to alter self-administration (0.5 mg/kg/infusion). In contrast, haloperidol (0.125 mg/kg, IP) increased responding for cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion), and shifted the dose-response curve for cocaine self-administration to the right. These data fail to support a role for the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor system in the reinforcing properties of this psychostimulant. Rather, the 5-HT1 or 5-HT2 receptors may be the critical subtype.
