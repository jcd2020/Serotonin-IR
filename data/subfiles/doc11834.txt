Singh, A. and P. Redfern (1994). "Lack of circadian variation in the responsiveness of alpha 2-heteroreceptors regulating serotonin release." Chronobiol Int 11(2): 94-102.

	We have previously shown that the circadian variation in 5-HT release is not the consequence of a variation in the activity of terminal 5-HT1B autoreceptors. However, recently identified alpha 2-adrenoceptors located on 5-HT nerve terminals may be important in regulating the release of 5-HT from serotonergic neurons. The sensitivity of hippocampal alpha 2-heteroreceptors to both agonist and antagonist was determined at different time points in the light:dark cycle of the rat. No significant circadian differences were evident in either the apparent pD2 values calculated for noradrenaline to inhibit potassium-evoked tritium efflux or in the apparent pA2 values calculated for phentolamine to antagonize the effect of noradrenaline. The corollary of the lack of a circadian rhythm in sensitivity to the alpha 2-heteroreceptor is that this receptor population will accurately reflect any circadian variation in noradrenaline release and in the available concentration of noradrenaline at the receptor sites.
