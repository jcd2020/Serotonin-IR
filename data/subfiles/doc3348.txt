Edwards, E., et al. (1996). "5-HT3-like receptors in the rat medial prefrontal cortex: Further pharmacological characterization." Brain Res 733(1): 21-30.

	The aim of the study was to further characterize the pharmacological properties of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(3)-like receptors in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) using combinations of biochemical and electrophysiological approaches. Phenylbiguanide (PEG) and three chlorinated derivatives, ortho-chloro-PBG (oCPBG), meta-chloro-PBG (mCPBG) and para-chloro-PBG (pCPBG), dose-dependently stimulated phosphoionositide (PI) turnover in fronto-cingulate cortical slices. All three chloro-isomers of PBG were equipotent in stimulating PI turnover. SR 57227A ((4-amino)-(6-chloro-2-pyridyl) L-piperidine hydrochloride, a novel compound with high affinity and selectivity for peripheral and central 5-HT3 receptors) dose-dependently stimulated PI turnover in fronto-cingulate cortical slices. The rank order of potency of all the 5-HT3 receptor agonists tested in the PI assay as compared to 5-HT was: 5-HT > 2-Me-5-HT > SR57227A > PBG = mCPBG = oCPBG = mCPBG. 5-HT and 5-HT receptor agonists depressed the firing rate of both spontaneously active and glutamate-activated quiescent mPFC cells in a current (dose)-dependent fashion. The rank order of effectiveness of these compounds was: 5-HT > SR57227A = 2-Me-5-HT = mCPBG = oCPBG = pCPBG = PBG. Unlike its action on the 5-HT3 receptors in the periphery or cultured cell Lines, D-tubocurarine chloride appears to be non-specific in blocking the depressant action of 2-Me-5-HT, gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopamine. Our results combined support the view that the pharmacological properties of 5-HT3-like receptors in the mPFC are not identical to those located in peripheral tissues and in cultured cell lines.
