	Impairment of the central serotonin system in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been shown postmortem and in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this PET study was to examine and compare the availability of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1B)-receptor subtype in patients with PD and age-matched control subjects. Twelve control subjects and 12 PD patients were examined with PET using the 5-HT(1B)-radioligand [(11)C]AZ10419369. In PD patients, 5-HT(1B)-receptor availability in the right orbitofrontal cortex was lower than in control subjects. A statistically significant negative correlation between 5-HT(1B)-receptor availability and age was obtained for the right temporal cortex in control subjects and for the right midbrain and left parahippocampal gyrus in PD patients. The lower regional 5-HT(1B)-receptor availability is in line with previous studies showing a decrease of serotonin imaging markers in PD and corroborates a role of the serotonin system in the pathophysiology of PD. The demonstrated age effect on 5-HT(1B) receptors suggest a physiologic and PD-related decline of serotonin function, indicating the importance of controlling for age in clinical studies.
