Hoyer, D., et al. (1985). "Molecular pharmacology of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 recognition sites in rat and pig brain membranes: radioligand binding studies with [3H]5-HT, [3H]8-OH-DPAT, (-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol, [3H]mesulergine and [3H]ketanserin." Eur J Pharmacol 118(1-2): 13-23.

	The pharmacological characteristics of the binding of [3H]8-OH-DPAT ([3H]8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, [125I]CYP ((-)[125I]iodocyanopindolol) (in the presence of 30 microM (-)isoprenaline) and [3H]mesulergine to 5-HT1 recognition sites were studied in rat and pig brain membranes. [3H]8-OH-DPAT bound in rat and pig cortex to the 5-HT1A recognition site characterized by high affinity for 5-CT (5-carboxamido-tryptamine), 8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) and low affinity for pirenperone, ketanserin and mesulergine. [125I]CYP bound in rat but not in pig cortex to the 5-HT1B site which shows high affinity for (-)21-009 (4[3-ter-butyl-amino-2-hydroxy-propoxy]indol-2-carbonic acid isopropyl ester), (+/-)ICYP (3-I-cyanopindolol), 5-HT, RU 24969 (5-methoxy-3-[1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridon-4-yl]1H-indole) and low affinity for 8-OH-DPAT, mesulergine and pirenperone. [3H]Mesulergine bound in pig choroid plexus and in rat cortex (besides binding to 5-HT2 sites in rat cortex) to the 5-HT1C recognition site characterized by high affinity for metergoline, mesulergine, 5-HT and methergine and low affinity for (-)21-009, ICYP, 8-OH-DPAT and spiroperidol. The pharmacological profile of 5-HT1A sites in rat and pig cortex appears to be identical; 5-HT1C sites in pig choroid plexus and rat cortex show no differences. In contrast, it was not possible to label 5-HT1B sites with [125I]CYP in pig brain membranes indicating that like 5-HT2 receptors, 5-HT1 recognition sites show species differences. The pharmacological profiles of the three 5-HT1 recognition sites are clearly different from one another. Furthermore, the pharmacological profile of each individual 5-HT1 recognition site is also different from that of the 5-HT2 receptors labelled with [3H]ketanserin in rat cortex membranes although some similarities exist between 5-HT2 and 5-HT1C sites. Finally, the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (-)21-009 which has different affinities for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1C recognition sites, yielded triphasic competition curves for [3H]5-HT binding in rat cortex membranes providing evidence that [3H]5-HT labels three distinct 5-HT1 sites in these membranes.
