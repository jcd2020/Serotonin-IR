	1 The rat 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(7) receptor displays two splice variations, a long form, and a truncated splice isoform, arising from the introduction of a stop codon near the carboxy-terminus. The human 5-HT7 receptor gene contains at least two introns and encodes. 445 amino acid 5-HT receptor. 2 A truncated splice variation in the human 5-HT7 receptor was isolated from a human placental cDNA library. In accordance with current NC-IUPHAR nomenclature guidelines, it is suggested that this receptor be denoted as the h5-HT7(b), receptor and the long form of the receptor as h5-HT7(a). 3 The h5-HT7(b) receptor was stably expressed in HEK 293 cells and ligand affinities were determined by displacement of [H-3]-5-carboxyamidotryptamine (5-CT; K-d=0.28 +/- 0.06 nM, B-max=7.3 +/- 1.7 pmol mg(-1) protein). The rank order of affinities (pK(i)) for a series of ligands was: 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT, 9.65)>5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 9.41)>methiothepin (8.87)>mesulergine (7.87)>8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 6.85) >ketanserin (6.44). 4 The h5-HT7(b) receptor coupled positively to adenylyl cyclase in HEK 293 cells. This response was elicited by a number of agonists with the following order of potency (pEC(50)): 5-CT (8.7 +/- 0.11)>5-MeOT (5-methoxytryptamine; 8.1 +/- 0.20)> 5-HT (7.5 +/- 0.13)>tryptamine (5.6 +/- 0.36)> 8-OH-DPAT (5.3 +/- 0.28)> 5-methoxytryptamine (5.0 +/- 0.06). This rank order was comparable to that observed in the radioligand binding studies. 5 In a similar fashion to that described for the 5-HT7(a) receptor, PCR studies suggested that the 5-HT7(b) receptor mRNA is found in great abundance throughout the brain, in the small intestine and aorta. 6 It is concluded that the h5-HT7 receptor, like the rat receptor, exists as splice variants exhibiting similar pharmacology, signal transduction and distribution. It is thus likely that there exists a complex physiological role for alternate splicing products of the 5-HT7 receptor gene.
