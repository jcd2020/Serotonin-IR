	1 Ejaculatory problems and anorgasmia are well-known side-effects of the SSRI antidepressants, and a pharmacologically induced increase in serotonergic neurotransmission inhibits ejaculatory behaviour in the rat. In the present study the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors in the mediation of male rat ejaculatory behaviour was examined by use of selective agonists and antagonists acting at these 5-HT receptor subtypes. 2 The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.25-4.00 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.) produced an expected facilitation of the male rat ejaculatory behaviour, and this effect was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the new selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (R)-3-N,N-dicyclobutylamino-8-fluoro-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5-carboxamide hydrogen (2R,3R) tartrate monohydrate (NAD-299) (1.0 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.). NAD-299 by itself (0.75-3.00 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.) did not affect the male rat ejaculatory behaviour. 3 The 5-HT1B receptor agonist anpirtoline (0.25-4.00 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the male rat ejaculatory behaviour, and this effect was fully antagonized by pretreatment with the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist isamoltane (16 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.) as well as by the new and selective antagonist (R)-(+)-2-(3-morpholinomethyl-2H-chromene-8-yl)oxymethylmorpholino methansulphonate (NAS-181) (16 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.). Isamoltane (1.0-16.0 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.) and NAD-181 (1.0-16.0 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.) had no, or weakly facilitatory effects on the male rat ejaculatory behaviour. The non-selective 5-HT1 receptor antagonist (-)-pindolol (8 mu mol kg(-1) s.c.), did not antagonize the inhibition produced by anpirtoline. 4 The present results demonstrate opposite effects, facilitation and inhibition, of male rat ejaculatory behaviour by stimulation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, respectively, suggesting that the SSRI-induced inhibition of male ejaculatory dysfunction is due to 5-HT1B receptor stimulation.
