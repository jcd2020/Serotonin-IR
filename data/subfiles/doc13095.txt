Veldman, S. A. and M. J. Bienkowski (1992). "CLONING AND PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF A NOVEL HUMAN 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE1D RECEPTOR SUBTYPE." Mol Pharmacol 42(3): 439-444.

	The canine RDC4 gene was used to isolate two distinct human serotonin receptor genes. The receptor encoded by clone RH-6 was the species homolog of RDC4 and was identical to a human serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine1D (5-HT(1D)) receptor that was recently reported [Mol Pharmacol. 40:143-148 (1991)]. The receptor encoded by RH-2 was a novel 5-HT receptor that was 61% identical to RH-6 and showed the greatest homology with the rat 5-HT,B receptor sequence (94%). The RH-2 gene contained an intronless, 1170-base pair, open reading frame that encoded a 390-amino acid protein that contained all of the hallmarks of a guanine nucleotide-binding protein-linked receptor. Heterologous expression of the RH-2 gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells led to the appearance of high affinity binding sites for 5-HT (K(d) = 2.6 nM, B(max) = 2.9 pmol/mg of membrane protein), and the receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells was coupled to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Competition binding experiments using compounds that are selective for various 5-HT receptor subtypes showed the highest correlation with a 5-HT-1D-like receptor (r = 0.89) and a low correlation with 5-HT-1B-like receptors. Examples of the 5-HT-1D-like pharmacology displayed by RH-2 include high affinity for the 5-HT-1D-selective compound sumatriptan (K(i) = 9.4 nm) and for the alpha-2-adrenergic receptor antagonist rauwolscine (K(i) = 47 nm). Therefore, despite the close genetic relationship between RH-2 and the rat 5-HT-1B receptor, our results indicate that the receptor encoded by RH-2 is best classified as a human 5-HT-1D receptor subtype and defines a second member of the human 5-HT-1D receptor family.
