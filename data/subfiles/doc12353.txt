Zhou, F. C., et al. (1998). "Additive reduction of alcohol drinking by 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 and serotonin uptake blocker fluoxetine in alcohol-preferring P rats." Alcoholism-Clinical and Experimental Research 22(1): 266-269.

	We found previously that alcohol-preferring (P) rats have fewer serotonin (5-HT) neurons and fibers in key brain regions than alcohol-nonpreferring (NP) rats. Because 5-HT uptake blockers increase synaptic 5-HT content and 5-HT1A receptor antagonists increase 5-HT release by disinhibiting 5-HT autoinnervation, in the present study, our intent was to determine whether increased synaptic 5-HT content and/or 5-HT release in P rats would effectively reduce alcohol consumption. In experiment 1, the 5-HT antagonist WAY 100635 (WAY) was tested on adult female P rats maintained on 24-hr free-choice access to ethanol (10% v/v) and water, Twice daily doses of WAY (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg, subcutaneously) were administered to each rat in a counterbalanced order, Baseline ethanol intake, derived from the mean ethanol intakes of the three previous non-drug days, was approximately 8 g/kg/day., Results indicated that 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg doses of WAY reduced 24-hr ethanol drinking by 25-30% (p < 0.01) without affecting 24-hr water intake or body weight. In the second experiment, the effects of WAY (0.5 mg/kg), fluoxetine (1.0 mg/kg), or a combination of both were tested in another group of female P rats WAY and fluoxetine, each alone, reduced ethanol drinking by around 20% and, when combined, decreased ethanol intake by 50%, whereas the body weight and the total fluid intake were not significantly affected. Taken together, these results indicate that both fluoxetine and WAY preferentially reduce ethanol drinking in the P line of rats and, when administered together, reduce ethanol intake in an additive manner. It is proposed that coadministration of these two compounds with distinct mechanisms of action may be a new strategy for reducing alcohol intake.
