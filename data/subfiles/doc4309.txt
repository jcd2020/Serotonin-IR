Hanson, L. A. and B. B. Gorzalka (1999). "The influence of corticosterone on serotonergic stereotypy and sexual behavior in the female rat." Behav Brain Res 104(1-2): 27-35.

	The effects of adrenalectomy and chronic corticosterone treatment on sexual behavior in the ovariectomized female rat were investigated. The serotonergic type 2A (5-HT2A) receptor-mediated behavior 'wet dog shakes' (WDS) was measured concurrently. In Experiment 1, adrenalectomy reduced the frequency of WDS following the administration of the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) but had no effect on spontaneous WDS. In Experiment 2, chronic corticosterone treatment increased DOI-induced WDS in both adrenalectomized and sham-adrenalectomized rats. In Experiment 3, adrenalectomized and sham-adrenalectomized rats were compared on measures of spontaneous WDS and sexual behavior following the administration of estrogen alone, or estrogen in combination with progesterone. Chronic corticosterone and acute progesterone administration increased WDS and facilitated sexual receptivity and proceptivity, while adrenalectomy decreased WDS, facilitated sexual receptivity and inhibited proceptivity. These findings suggest that the behavioral effects seen following hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis disruption may, in part, be mediated by altered 5-HT2A receptor responsivity.
