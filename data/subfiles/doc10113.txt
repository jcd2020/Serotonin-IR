Serrats, J., et al. (2004). "5-ht5B receptor mRNA in the raphe nuclei: coexpression with serotonin transporter." Synapse 51(2): 102-111.

	We used double-label in situ hybridization to examine the cellular localization of 5-ht(5B) receptor mRNA in relation to serotonin transporter mRNA in the rat dorsal raphe (DR) and central superior nucleus (CS, median raphe nucleus). 5-ht(5B) receptor mRNA hybridization signal was often found on serotonin transporter mRNA-positive neuron profiles. The degree of cellular colocalization of these mRNAs notably varied among the different regions of the raphe nuclei. In the DR, cell bodies showing 5-ht(5B) receptor mRNA expression were abundant in the medial portions of the nucleus, all of them being also labeled for serotonin transporter mRNA. In contrast, in the ventrolateral regions (lateral wings) of the DR, we observed serotonin transporter mRNA-positive cells, but they were devoid of 5-ht(5B) receptor mRNA signal. In the CS, the level of coexpression of 5-ht(5B) receptor mRNA with serotonin transporter mRNA was high in the intermediate portions of the nucleus; however, we were unable to detect specific 5-ht(5B) receptor mRNA hybridization signal in its caudal extent. Our results support the presence of 5-ht(5B) receptor in serotonergic neurons in the DR and CS, suggesting an autoreceptor role for this receptor subtype.
