Di Mauro, M., et al. (2003). "Noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine in cerebellar nuclei of the rat: functional effects on neuronal firing." Neuroscience Letters 347(2): 101-105.

	The firing rate of single cerebellar nuclear neurons was studied during microiontophoretic application of noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and their agonists in deeply anesthetized rats. NA application depressed the neuronal firing rate more in the medial nucleus (MN) than in the interpositus (IN) and in the lateral nucleus (LN). These responses were mimicked by alpha(2) and, to a lesser extent, beta receptor agonists. 5-HT evoked inhibition in MN and various effects (inhibitory, excitatory, biphasic) in IN and LN. Excitatory responses were more numerous in the posterior than in the anterior zone of IN. Agonists at 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors mimicked inhibition only. In conclusion, NA and 5-HT exerted a similar action on MN neurons; in contrast, the effects of 5-HT on IN and LN were more differentiated than those exerted by NA.
