Castro, M. E., et al. (1998). "5-HT1B receptor binding in degenerative movement disorders." Brain Res 790(1-2): 323-328.

	Using [3H]sumatriptan as a radioligand, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1B receptors were examined in posterior striatum and midbrain post-mortem tissue sections of 12 patients who had died from representative degenerative movement disorders as compared to nine controls. In the control human basal ganglia, the highest densities of [3H]sumatriptan binding were observed in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. No significant change in the density of [3H]sumatriptan binding sites was found in the striatum and substantia nigra of the six Parkinson's disease brains. In the two brains from patients with progressive supranuclear palsy an increase was found in the densities of [3H]sumatriptan binding sites, most marked in the substantia nigra. In contrast, [3H]sumatriptan labelling was almost absent in the striatonigral degeneration brain and was markedly reduced in the three Huntington's disease brains. This study indicates that the status of 5-HT1B receptors is different in each degenerative movement disorder and suggests that human 5-HT1B receptors are located somatodendritically on GABAergic and peptidergic caudate-putamen neurons which project to the substantia nigra and globus pallidus, where these receptors are presynaptic.
