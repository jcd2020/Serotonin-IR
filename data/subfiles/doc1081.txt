Bianchi, C., et al. (2002). "Dual effects of 5-HT4 receptor activation on GABA release from guinea pig hippocampal slices." Neuroreport 13(17): 2177-2180.

	The effects of BIMU-8, a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, were studied on GABA release in guinea pig hippocampal slices. BIMU-8 did not modify GABA outflow at rest but did display a complex action in electrically stimulated slices: at low concentrations it increased, and at higher concentrations inhibited, GABA release. These responses were competitively counteracted by GR 125487, a selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist. The dual effects of BIMU-8 are consistent with its indirect cholinergic action since the M1 and M3 antagonist, 4-DAMP, prevented BIMU-8-elicited GABA facilitation, whereas the M2 antagonist AFDX-116 cancelled GABA inhibition. These results provide evidence that serotonin exerts a complex modulation on the GABAergic system, via 5-HT4 receptors, and suggest that the amine releases acetylcholine which, in turn, bidirectionally modulates GABA release.
