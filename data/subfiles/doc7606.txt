Mokrosz, M. J., et al. (1997). "Structure-activity relationship studies of CNS agents, Part 32: Effect of structural modifications in 1-arylpiperazine derivatives on alpha(1) -adrenoreceptor affinity." Arch Pharm (Weinheim) 330(6): 177-180.

	The alpha(1)-adrenergic and 5-HT1A serotonergic receptor affinities of a series of 1-arylpiperazines are presented. The role of the spacer and the influence of the terminal substituents on the alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor affinity and the 5-HT1A/alpha(1) receptor selectivity are discussed.
