Orer, H. S., et al. (1996). "Role of serotonergic neurons in the maintenance of the 10-Hz rhythm in sympathetic nerve discharge." Am J Physiol 270(1 Pt 2): R174-181.

	We studied the effects of serotonin (5-HT)-receptor agonists and antagonists on the naturally occurring 10-Hz rhythm in sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) of urethan-anesthetized, baroreceptor-denervated cats. Intravenous doses of the 5-HT1A-receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and U-93385E, which inhibit the firing of serotonergic medullary raphe neurons, decreased the power in the 10-Hz band of SND without affecting the power at frequencies < or = 6 Hz. The inhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT and U-93385E were reversed by the 5-HT1A-receptor antagonists spiperone and WAY-100135. Microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT into medullary raphe nuclei also selectively eliminated the 10-Hz rhythm in SND. Intravenous administration of the 5-HT2-receptor antagonist methysergide blocked the 10-Hz rhythm in SND, whereas the 5-HT2-receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-amino-propane increased peak frequency and power in the 10-Hz band of SND. Microinjection of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid into the medullary raphe also enhanced the 10-Hz rhythm in SND. These data support the view that the naturally occurring discharges of serotonergic medullary raphe neurons preferentially enhance the 10-Hz rhythm in SND.
