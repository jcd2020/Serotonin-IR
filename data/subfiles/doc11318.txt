Saroja, S. R., et al. (2014). "Hippocampal monoamine receptor complex levels linked to spatial memory decline in the aging C57BL/6J." Behav Brain Res 264: 1-8.

	Although a large series of reports on monoamine receptor (MAR) biochemistry and pharmacology in aging are available, work on MAR complexes rather than subunits is limited. It was the aim of the study to determine MAR complexes in hippocampi of three different age groups (3-12 and 18 months) in the mouse and to link MAR changes to spatial memory retrieval in the Morris water maze (MWM). MAR complexes were separated by blue native electrophoresis. Immunohistochemistry was performed in order to show the pattern of dopamine receptors and its colocalizations. D1R, D2R and 5-HT7R containing receptor complex levels were decreasing with age while 5-HT1AR-containing complex levels were increasing with age. D1R, 5-HT7R and 5-HT1AR were significantly correlating with the time spent in the target quadrant, representing retrieval in the MWM. D1R and D2R immunoreactivity was decreasing in an area-dependent pattern and D1R and D2R were colocalized. Individual monoamine receptors are linked to spatial memory retrieval and are modulated by age. The findings are relevant for interpretation of previous and design of future work on brain receptors, spatial memory and aging.
