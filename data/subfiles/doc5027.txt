Harsing, L. G., et al. (2004). "A 5-HT7 heteroreceptor-mediated inhibition of H-3 serotonin release in raphe nuclei slices of the rat: Evidence for a serotonergic-glutamatergic interaction." Neurochem Res 29(8): 1487-1497.

	Midbrain slices containing the dorsal and medial raphe nuclei were prepared from rat brain, loaded with [H-3] serotonin ([H-3]5-HT), superfused, and the electrically induced efflux of radioactivity was determined. The nonselective 5-HT receptor agonist 5-carboxamido-tryptamine (5-CT; 0.001 to 1 muM) inhibited the electrically stimulated [H-3]5-HT overflow from raphe nuclei slices (IC50 of 3.34 +/- 0.37 nM). This effect of 5-CT on [H-3]5-HT overflow was antagonized by the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-258719 (10 muM) and the 5-HT1B/1D antagonist SB-216641 (1 muM), the IC50 values for 5-CT in the presence of SB-258719 and SB-216641 were 94.23 +/- 4.84 and 47.81 +/- 4.66 nM. The apparent pA(2) values for SB-258719 and SB-216641 against 5-CT were 6.43 and 7.12, respectively. The inhibitory effect of 5-CT on [H-3]5-HT overflow was weakly antagonized by 10 muM of WAY-100635, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (IC50 6.65 +/- 0.56 nM, apparent pA(2) 4.99). The antagonist effect of SB-258719 (10 muM) on 5-CT-evoked [H-3]5-HT overflow inhibition was also determined in the presence of 1 muM SB-216641 or 1 muM SB-216641 and 10 muM WAY-100635, and additive interactions were found between the antagonists of 5-HT7 and 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Addition of the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 muM) in the presence of SB-216641 (1 muM) and WAY-100635 (10 muM) attenuated the inhibitory effect of 5-CT on KCl-induced [H-3]5-HT overflow. These findings indicate that 5-CT inhibits [H-3]5-HT overflow from raphe nuclei slices of the rat by stimulation of 5-HT7 and 5-HT1B/1D receptors, whereas the role of 5-HT1A receptors in this inhibition is less pronounced. They also suggest that 5-HT7 receptors are probably not located on serotonergic neurons and thus may serve as heteroreceptors in regulation of 5-HT release in the raphe nuclei. 5-CT (0.1 muM) also inhibited [ 3H] glutamate release, and SB-258719 (10 muM) suspended this effect. We therefore speculated that the axon terminals of the glutamatergic cortico-raphe neurons may possess 5-HT7 receptors that inhibit glutamate release, which consequently leads to decreased activity of serotonergic neurons. The postulated glutamatergic-serotonergic interaction in the raphe nuclei was further evidenced by the finding that N-methyl-D-aspartate and AMPA enhanced [H-3]5-HT release.
