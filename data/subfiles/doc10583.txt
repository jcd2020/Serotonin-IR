Stancampiano, R., et al. (1994). "PENILE ERECTION AND YAWNING INDUCED BY 5-HT1C RECEPTOR AGONISTS IN MALE-RATS - RELATIONSHIP WITH DOPAMINERGIC AND OXYTOCINERGIC TRANSMISSION." European Journal of Pharmacology 261(1-2): 149-155.

	1-(3-Chlorophenyl)piperazine (m-CPP) (0.1-4 mg/kg s.c.) and N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine (TFMPP) (0.5-4 mg/kg s.c.), 5-HT1C receptor agonists, but not 8-hydroxy-dipropylamino-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg s.c.), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, induced penile erection and yawning with a U-inverted dose-response curve in male rats. The maximal effect was found with 0.5 mg/kg s.c. of m-CPP and with 1 mg/kg s.c. of TFMPP. The m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) and TFMPP (1 mg/kg s.c.) responses were prevented by mianserin (0.2 mg/kg s.c.) and by ritanserin (1 mg/kg s.c.) given 15 min before m-CPP and TFMPP. In contrast, m-CPP- or TFMPP-induced penile erection and yawning were not antagonized by haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) or by [d(CH2)(5)Tyr(Me)(2),Orn(8)]vasotocin (5 mu g i.c.v.). Apomorphine- and oxytocin-induced penile erection, but not yawning, was also antagonized by mianserin and less effectively by ritanserin. The results suggest that 5-HT1C receptor agonist-induced penile erection and yawning are not mediated by increased dopaminergic and/or oxytocinergic transmission, and raise the possibility that a neuronal dopamine-oxytocin-5-HT link is involved in the control of penile erection and not necessarily of yawning in male rats.
