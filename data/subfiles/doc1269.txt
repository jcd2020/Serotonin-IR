	Milnacipran is a serotonin/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) which has not yet been systematically studied preclinically or clinically for the treatment of anxiety disorders. In the four-plate test (FPT) which is known to predict anxiolytic-like activity in mice, milnacipran (4, 8, 16 and 32 mg/kg) demonstrated strong anti-punishment effects following acute administration. The anxiolytic-like effect of milnacipran was not reversed by the selective GABA(A) receptor antagonist, flumazenil (2 and 4 mg/kg), the selective alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin (0.5 and 2 mg/kg), the selective alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan (1 and 4 mg/kg) or the selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist, SB 206553 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). In contrast, the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, SR 46349B (0.1 and 1 mg/kg), and the non-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (0.125 and 0.5 mg/kg), completely abolished the anxiolytic-like effect of milnacipran in FPT. Neurochemical depletion of NA or 5-HT completely abolished the activity of milnacipran. These results strongly suggest that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is critically involved in the anxiolytic activity of milnacipran. On the other hand the lack of activity of milnacipran after depletion of NA or 5-HT is consistent with milnacipran acting on the locus coeruleus to induce 5-HT release. The present data suggest a strong connection between 5-HT2A receptors and NA neurotransmission.
