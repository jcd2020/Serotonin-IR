Li, X., et al. (2020). "Depressive-like state sensitizes 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) auto-receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus sub-system." Behav Brain Res 389: 112618.

	Dorsal raphe (DR) and median raphe (MR) 5-HT neurons are two distinct sub-systems known to be regulated by 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) auto-receptors. Whether the auto-receptors in each sub-system are functionally altered in depressive-like state remains unknown. The present study is aimed to study a specific circuit (DR-ventral hippocampus and MR-dorsal hippocampus) within each sub-system to investigate changes in receptor sensitivity in the pathogenesis of depression. A mouse model of depression was developed through the social defeat paradigm, and was then treated with fluoxetine (FLX). 5-HT(1A) auto-receptor in the neuronal cell body (DR or MR) and 5-HT(1B) auto-receptor in the axonal terminal (ventral or dorsal hippocampus) were directly targeted by local perfusion of antagonists (5-HT(1A): WAY100635; 5-HT(1B): GR127935) through reverse microdialysis. Time courses of dialysate 5-HT measured at the axonal terminal were subsequently determined for each circuit. At baseline, 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) antagonists dose-dependently increased dialysate 5-HT, with sub-circuit specificity. In the depressive-like state, greater increases in dialysate 5-HT were observed only in the DR-ventral hippocampus circuit following local delivery of both antagonists, which were then fully restored following the FLX treatment. In contrast, no changes were observed in the MR-dorsal hippocampus circuit. Our results demonstrate differential changes in sensitivities of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) auto-receptors in the DR-ventral hippocampus and MR-dorsal hippocampus circuits. 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) auto-receptors in the DR-ventral hippocampus circuit are sensitized in the depressive-like state. Taken together, these results suggest that the DR sub-system maybe the neural substrate mediating depressive phenotypes.
