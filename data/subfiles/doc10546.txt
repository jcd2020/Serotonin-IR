Sprouse, J. S., et al. (1999). "Comparison of the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone with clozapine and olanzapine: Inhibition of dorsal raphe cell firing and the role of 5-HT1A receptor activation." Neuropsychopharmacology 21(5): 622-631.

	Ziprasidone is a novel antipsychotic agent which binds with high affinity to 5-HT1A receptors (K-i = 3.4 nM), in addition to 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, and D-2 sites. While it is an antagonist at these latter receptors, ziprasidone behaves as a 5-HT1A agonist in vitro in adenylate cyclase measurements. The goal of the present study was to examine the 5-HT1A properties of ziprasidone in vivo using as a marker of central 5-HT1A activity the inhibition of firing of serotonin-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. In anesthetized rats, ziprasidone dose-dependently slowed raphe unit activity (ED50 = 300 mu g/kg IV) as did the atypical antipsychotics clozapine (ED50 = 250 mu g/kg IV) and olanzapine (ED50 = 1000 mu g/kg IV). Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100,635 (10 mu g/kg IV) prevented the ziprasidone-induced inhibition; the same dose of WAY-100,635 had little effect on the inhibition produced by clozapine and olanzapine. Because all three agents also bind to alpha(1) receptors, antagonists of which inhibit serotonin neuronal firing, this aspect of their pharmacology was assessed with desipramine (DMI), a NE re-uptake blocker previously shown to reverse the effects of alpha(1) antagonists on raphe unit activity. DMI (5 mg/kg IV) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of ziprasidone but produced nearly complete reversal of that of clozapine and olanzapine. These profiles suggest a mechanism of action for each agent, 5-HT1A agonism for ziprasidone and alpha(1) antagonism for clozapine and olanzapine. The 5-HT1A agonist activity reported here clearly distinguishes ziprasidone from currently available antipsychotic agents and suggests that this property may play a significant role in its pharmacologic actions.
