	BACKGROUND: (+/-)Pindolol is a beta-adrenergic/5-HT1A receptor antagonist used in combination with certain antidepressant drugs to accelerate the onset of the antidepressive response. METHODS: The aim of the present study was to assess, using an in vivo electrophysiologic paradigm, the effect of (+/-)pindolol on the spontaneous firing activity of rat dorsal raphe serotonin (5-HT) and locus coeruleus noradrenaline (NA) neurons. RESULTS: (+/-)Pindolol did not modify the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons at low doses (10 and 200 micrograms/kg, i.v.), but it prevented the suppressant effect of the 5-HT autoreceptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD, 10 micrograms/kg, i.v.) but not that of the 5-HT1A receptor 8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-aminotetralin (8-OHDPAT, 5 micrograms/kg, i.v.). At a higher dose (500 micrograms/kg, i.v.), (+/-)pindolol decreased 5-HT neuronal firing and this effect was reversed by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.), suggesting that it could act as a partial 5-HT1A autoreceptor agonist. In the locus coeruleus, the high dose of (+/-)pindolol decreased the firing activity of NA neurons and this effect was reversed by the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL 100907 (200 micrograms/kg, i.v.). Finally, both a lesion of NA neurons and the administration of MDL 100907 prevented the suppressant effect of (+/-)pindolol on the firing of 5-HT neurons. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that, at low doses, (+/-)pindolol acts as a somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor antagonist whereas at a higher dose, it decreases the tonic excitatory input from NA neurons to 5-HT neurons.
