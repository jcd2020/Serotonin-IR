	Positron emission tomography (PET) ligands that are sensitive to transient changes in serotonin (5-HT) concentration are desirable for studies of neuropsychiatric diseases. Few studies, however, have sought to demonstrate that variations in 5-HT concentration can be closely tracked with available serotonergic ligands. Microdialysis studies in rats have shown a maximal increase in 5-HT concentration in raphe nuclei after systemic infusion of selective serotonergic re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs). We performed PET scans with [(18)F]FPWAY, an intermediate-affinity antagonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors, in 4 anesthetized rhesus monkeys in control studies and after systemic paroxetine administration (5 mg/kg, i.v.). In addition, a paired [(11)C]DASB study revealed that this paroxetine regimen produced an occupancy of 54-83% of the serotonin transporters. According to the conventional receptor competition model, increased 5-HT concentration produces decreased binding of the radioactive ligand. Over a 3-h period following paroxetine infusion, a progressively increasing reduction (ranging from 8 +/- 6% to 27 +/- 10%) of [(18)F]FPWAY-specific binding was found in the raphe nuclei. This result is interpreted as an SSRI-induced increase in 5-HT concentration, potentially combined with reduced binding to internalized 5-HT(1A) receptors. In addition, a transient (1 h) increase in cerebral cortical binding was observed, attributed primarily to a reduction in cortical 5-HT due to the effects of raphe autoreceptor inhibition. This study is the first demonstration of the feasibility of quantifying dynamic changes in 5-HT neurotransmission in the raphe and the cortex with PET. These results lend promise to the use of these serotonergic neuroimaging techniques to study neuropsychiatric disorders.
