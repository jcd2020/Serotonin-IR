	Nerve growth factor, a neurotrophin, may have other functions, including a role in depressive disorders. The present study sought to determine whether NGF would (1) have antidepressant-like effects and (2) behave similarly to or differently from other well-recognized antidepressants. Over a broad dose-range, NGF reduced the exaggerated swim test immobility exhibited by the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats, but at a standard dose of 40 ng/ml, it was not as effective as desipramine (DMI, 5 mg/kg). The low social interaction behavior and locomotor activity of the FSL rats were less affected by NGF than was the immobility. Acute treatment with NGF did not induce c-fos expression in brain regions known to be activated by other acute antidepressants. The fact that chronic treatment with DMI blunted the corticosterone response to fluoxetine was replicated in this study. However, chronic treatment with NGF did not alter this response. Similarly, chronic treatment with fluoxetine blunted 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor-mediated responses, whereas chronic treatment with NGF was without effect. Thus, NGF has antidepressant-like effects but does not appear to have biochemical actions typical of other antidepressants. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
