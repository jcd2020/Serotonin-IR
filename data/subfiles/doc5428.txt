	The two diphenylbutylpiperazinepyridinyl derivatives, FG5865 and FG5893, have a unique receptor binding profile in that they show very high and essentially equipotent affinities for both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. The present report describes the acute effects of FG5865 and FG5893 on presynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neuronal function in the rat CNS, using established ex vivo and in vivo neurochemical techniques. Post-mortem measurements of tissue levels of 5-HT, its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), and of the formation of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP; after inhibition of aromatic amino acid decarboxylase by NSD 1015) showed that FG5865 (0.1-20 mg/kg, s.c.) and FG5893 (0.1-20 mg/kg, s.c.) dose dependently decreased the synthesis and the metabolism/turnover of 5-HT--this to an extent comparable to the reference 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. Reserpine (5 mg/kg, s.c.) pretreatment did not prevent the FG5893-induced decrease of 5-HT synthesis rate. In contrast, about 25-50 times higher doses of FG5865 were required to produce a comparable decrease in brain 5-HT synthesis in reserpinized vs. non-pretreated rats. In in vivo microdialysis experiments, both FG5865 (0.1-3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) and FG5893 (0.03-1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) caused a marked and dose-dependent decrease of 5-HT release in the ventral hippocampus. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, (+/-)-pindolol (8 mg/kg, s.c.), abolished the FG5865 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced reduction of 5-HT release, and (-)-pindolol (8 mg/kg, s.c.) similarly reversed the FG5893 (0.3 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced decrease. Local infusion of FG5865 into the ventral hippocampus (10 microM, 20-min pulse) resulted in a rapid and transient elevation of the 5-HT output, an effect that was independent of extracellular Ca2+. FG5893, on the other hand, did not affect the 5-HT release upon local administration. The results demonstrate that FG5865 and FG5893 potently affect a range of neurochemical indices of rat brain 5-HT neuronal activity in vivo, in a way consistent with indirect (FG5865) and direct (FG5865 and FG5893) stimulation of the 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei.
