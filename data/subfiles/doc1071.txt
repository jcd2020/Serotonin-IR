	Defensive rage behavior is a form of aggressive behavior occurring in nature in response to a threatening stimulus. It is also elicited by stimulation of the medial hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) and mediated through specific neurotransmitter-receptor mechanisms within these regions. Since interleukin (IL)-2 modulates the release of neurotransmitters linked to aggression and rage, we sought to determine whether IL-2 microinjected into the medial hypothalamus would modulate defensive rage. Microinjections of relatively low doses of IL-2 into the medial hypothalamus significantly suppressed defensive rage elicited from the PAG in a dose-dependent manner and in the absence of signs of sickness behavior. Pre-treatment with an antibody directed against IL-2Ralpha or a GABA(A) receptor antagonist blocked IL-2's suppressive effects upon defensive rage. Since the suppression of defensive rage is also mediated by 5-HT(1) receptors in the medial hypothalamus, a 5-HT(1) antagonist was microinjected into this region as a pretreatment for IL-2; however, it did not block IL-2's suppressive effects. Immunocytochemical data provided anatomical support for these findings by revealing extensive labeling of IL-2Ralpha on neurons in the medial hypothalamus. IL-2 microinjected into the medial hypothalamus did not modulate predatory attack elicited from the lateral hypothalamus. In summary, we provide evidence for a novel role for IL-2 in the medial hypothalamus as a potent suppressor of defensive rage behavior. These effects are mediated through an IL-2-GABA(A) receptor mechanism.
