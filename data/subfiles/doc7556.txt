	Early-life stress increases susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD), in which the dysfunction of 5-hydroxytryptamine plays an important role. miRNA-135a in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and miRNA-16 in the hippocampus (HIP) are closely related to the 5-HT neurotransmitter system. Here, we investigated behavior, miRNA-135a in the PFC, miRNA-16 in the HIP, and 5-HT1AR expression in both brain regions in adolescent and adult rats that were exposed to inescapable stress during their adolescence. Paroxetine hydrochloride and corticotropin-releasing factor antagonist (CP-154,526) were used as intervening measures. Our study demonstrated that early adolescent stress induced anxiety-like behaviors and spatial memory damage, a reduction in miRNA-135a expression was associated with increased 5-HT1AR expression in PFC, and increased miRNA-16 expression in the HIP of stressed rats. Drug treatments alleviated behaviors and reversed the miRNA-135a, miRNA-16, and 5-HT1AR expression in stressed rats.
