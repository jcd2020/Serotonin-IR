Cutrera, R. A., et al. (1996). "Phase-shifting effect of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor agonist, on locomotor activity in golden hamster in constant darkness." Neurosci Lett 210(1): 1-4.

	The present results show that under constant darkness the endogenous circadian pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei can be affected by administration of 8-hydroxy-2-[di-n-propylamino] tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a well known 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor agonist. A single i.p. injection (0.1 ml) with 8-OH-DPAT (5 mg/kg) induced significant phase-advances of hamster locomotor activity at circadian time (CT) 6 and 8 and a significant phase-delay at CT11. Saline injections by themselves induced a significant phase-advance at CT10-11. The dose-response curve for 8-OH-DPAT showed a maximal phase-shifting effect for doses of at least 2.5 mg/kg at CT8. Thus, in golden hamsters. (1) 8-OH-DPAT has a chronobiological effect with sensitivity depending upon the circadian time of injection, and (2) a single saline injection is able to induce regular phase-advances at the end of the subjective day (CT10-11).
