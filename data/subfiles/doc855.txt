	We investigated whether 5-HT1B receptor-mediated inhibition of evoked. glycinergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) in hypoglossal motoneurons (HMs) changed postnatally. In HMs from postnatal days 2-3 (P2-3, neonate) and P10-11 (juvenile) rats bath application of 5-HT (10 muM) caused a not significantly different large reduction in eIPSC amplitude to 35.0+/-22.5% (mean +/-S.D.) and 35.4+/-10.6% of control; respectively. The dose-response relationship for the 5-HT,,, receptor agonist, CP-93,129, revealed that the mean agonist concentration at half-maximal inhibition (IC50) was similar, 1.6 and 2.0 nM, respectively. Additionally, strong antibody labeling of 5-HT,. receptors in the hypoglossal motor nucleus was observed in neonates, juveniles and adults. These results demonstrate that over the postnatal period studied, 5-HT,. receptor-mediated inhibition of glycinergic eIPSCs is not age dependent. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.
