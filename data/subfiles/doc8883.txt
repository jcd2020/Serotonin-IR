	Catalepsy induced by neuroleptics in rats can be modified by 5-hydroxytryptaminergic (5-HTergic) manipulation. For example, buspirone (BUS) and other central 5-HT1A receptor ligands reduce neuroleptic-induced catalepsy (NIC). The dorsal (DRN) and median (MRN) raphe nuclei are reported to be important sources of 5-HTergic projections to the basal ganglia, the site of action of neuroleptics in producing NIC. A previous study showed that lesion of DRN did not affect NIC or the anticataleptic effect of BUS. The present study was designed to evaluate the participation of MRN in NIC and in the anti-NIC effect of BUS. Twenty-four male Wistar rats (N = 6/group) weighing 220-250 g were used. Electrolytic lesion of MRN was carried out in anesthetized rats along with sham operations (electrode inserted but no current applied). Ten days later, the rats were injected with BUS (5 mg/kg, ip) or saline (1 ml, ip). Catalepsy was induced 20 min later with haloperidol (H; 1 mg/kg, ip) and measured at 30-min intervals by means of a bar test. The Costall & Naylor method of scoring (range 0-5 points) was used. Saline-injected MRN-lesioned rats displayed significantly lower catalepsy scores than sham-lesioned rats (1.5 +/- 0.2 vs 3.8 +/- 0.3 at 90 min after H). In sham-lesioned rats, BUS significantly reduced the catalepsy scores in comparison with saline-treated animals (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 3.8 +/- 0.3 at 90 min after H). However, BUS was not able to further reduce NIC in the MRN-lesioned animals.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
