	Microtubule-associated protein 1A (MAP1A) is essential during the late differentiation phase of neuronal development. Here, we demonstrated the presence of two MAP1A isoforms with a differential spatial distribution in the adult mouse barrel cortex. Antibody A stained MAP1A in pyramidal and stellate cells, including dendrites that crossed layer IV in the septa between barrels. The other antibody, BW6 recognized a MAP1A isoform that was mainly confined to the barrel hollow and identified smaller caliber dendrites. Previously, an interaction of MAP1A and the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor was shown in the rat cortex. Here, we identified, by double-immunofluorescent labeling, MAP1A isoform and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor distribution. MAP1A co-localized mainly with 5-HT(2A) receptor in larger apical dendrites situated in septa. This differential staining of MAP1A and a serotonin receptor in defined barrel compartments may be due to changes in the expression or processing of MAP1A during dendritic transport as a consequence of functional differences in processing of whisker-related sensory input.
