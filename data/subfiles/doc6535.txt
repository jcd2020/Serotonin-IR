	Depression, a severe mental disease, is greatly difficult to treat and easy to induce other neuropsychiatric symptoms, the most frequent one is cognitive impairment. In this study, a series of novel vilazodonetacrine hybrids were designed, synthesized and evaluated as multitarget agents against depression with cognitive impairment. Most compounds exhibited good multitarget activities and appropriate blood-brain barrier permeability. Specifically, compounds 1d and 2a exhibited excellent 5-HT1A agonist activities (1d, EC50 = 0.36 +/- 0.08 nM; 2a, EC50 = 0.58 +/- 0.14 nM) and 5-HT reuptake inhibitory activities (1d, IC50 = 20.42 +/- 6.60 nM; 2a, IC50 = 22.10 +/- 5.80 nM). In addition, they showed moderate ChE inhibitory activities (1d, AChE IC50 = 1.72 +/- 0.217 mu M, BuChE IC50 = 0.34 +/- 0.03 mu M; 2a, AChE IC50 = 2.36 +/- 0.34 mu M, BuChE IC50 = 0.10 +/- 0.01 mu M). Good multitarget activities with goodt blood-brain barrier permeability of 1d and 2a make them good lead compounds for the further study of depression with cognitive impairment.
