Cohen, M. L., et al. (1986). "In vitro receptor specificity of the 5HT1A selective phenylpiperazine, LY165163." Life Sci 39(25): 2441-2446.

	LY165163, a ligand reported to be selective for the 5HT1A subtype of serotonin receptor, was examined for its ability to interact with 5HT2 receptors in the rat jugular vein and alpha-receptors in the rat aorta. In these smooth muscle preparations, no agonist activity of LY165163 occurred in concentrations up to 10(-5) M. However, LY165163 was an antagonist of serotonin-induced contractions in the jugular vein and of norepinephrine-induced contractions in the rat aorta. The dissociation constant calculated for LY165163 at 5HT2 receptors in the rat jugular vein was 10(-8) M and at alpha-receptors in the rat aorta was 2 X 10(-7) M. Thus, LY165163 is a relatively potent antagonist at vascular 5HT2 sites and possesses appreciable affinity at alpha-receptors. Based on these data, the multiple receptor interactions of LY165163 must be taken into consideration when utilizing this agent as a probe for the 5HT1A subtype of serotonin receptor.
