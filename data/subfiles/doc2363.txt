	Hypoglossal (XII) motoneurons are activated by type 2 receptors for serotonin (5-HT). This activation is especially strong during wakefulness which facilitates diverse motor functions of the tongue, including the maintenance of upper airway patency in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. We tested whether 5-HT(2) receptor levels in the XII nucleus vary with intensity of tongue use. Three groups of rats were housed overnight under conditions of increasing oromotor activity: W-water available ad lib; S-sweetened water to stimulate drinking; S + O-sweetened water + oil applied on fur to increase grooming. After the exposures, immunostaining for 5-HT(2C), but not 5-HT(2A), receptors was higher in the XII nucleus in S + O than in W rats (65 ± 1.8 (SE) vs. 60 ± 2.0 arbitrary units; p = 0.008). In the medullary raphé obscurus region, the percentage of c-Fos-positive 5-HT cells was 13% higher (p = 0.03) in S + O than in W rats. The positive feedback between tongue use and 5-HT(2C) receptor immunostaining reveals a novel mechanism potentially relevant for OSA and neuromuscular disorders.
