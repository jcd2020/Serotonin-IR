	Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors (5-HT(2A)Rs and 5-HT(2C)Rs), which innervate the dopamine mesoaccumbens pathway, may play an important role in the behavioral effects of cocaine. To test this hypothesis, the present study measured cocaine-evoked locomotor activity after bilateral microinjection of selective 5-HT(2A)R and 5-HT(2C)R antagonists into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell. Locomotor activity was measured after intracranial microinjection of saline (0.2 microl/side), the selective 5-HT(2A)R antagonist R-(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine methanol (M100907) (0.1 or 0.3 microg. 0.2 microl(-1). side(-1)), or the selective 5-HT(2C)R antagonist 8-[5-(2,4-dimethoxy-5-(4-trifluoromethylphenylsulfon-amido)phenyl-5-oxopentyl)]-1 ,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]decane-2,4-dione hydrochloride (RS 102221) (0.05-0.5 microg. 0.2 microl(-1). side(-1)) followed by an injection of saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.) or cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). Microinjection of M100907 (0.1-0.3 microg/side) into the VTA or RS 102221 (0.15-0.5 microg/side) into the NAc shell attenuated cocaine-induced hyperactivity in a dose-related manner. However, hyperactivity evoked by cocaine was not altered by microinjection of RS 102221 into the VTA or M100907 into the NAc shell. No changes in basal activity were observed after microinjection of M100907 or RS 102221 into either brain region. These findings are the first to demonstrate that the behavioral effects of cocaine are generated in part by activation of 5-HT(2A)Rs in the VTA and by activation of 5-HT(2C)Rs in the NAc shell. The selective regulation of the mesoaccumbens circuit by 5-HT(2A)Rs and 5-HT(2C)Rs implicates these 5-HT receptors as important in the behavioral outcomes of systemic cocaine administration.
