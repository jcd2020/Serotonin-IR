	1. Talipexole showed moderate displacement activity of H-3-GR 65630 binding to 5-HT3 receptors in both rat cortical and intestinal membrane fractions with Ki values of 0.35 mu M and 0.22 mu M, respectively. 2. Bromocriptine failed to displace the binding activity in either experimental system even at a concentration of 10 mu M 3. Both talipexole and tropisetron were found to significantly inhibit 5-HT3 receptor-mediated effects of 5-HT in isolated guinea-pig ileum or atrium; however, the effect of talipexole was weaker than that of tropisetron. 4. Bromocriptine, in contrast, had no antagonistic effects on 5-HT3 receptor-mediated activity in guinea-pig ileum or atrium. 5. It was concluded that talipexole might act as an antagonist on 5-HT3 receptors in both brain and intestinal tissues.
