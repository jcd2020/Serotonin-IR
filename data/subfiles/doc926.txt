	This paper aimed at reviewing publications investigating the involvement of genetic factors in anxiety behavior, using a meta-analysis of rodent studies involving targeted mutations of neurotransmission genes. We summarized 311 experiments investigating the involvement of GABAergic, serotoninergic, glutamatergic, and neuropeptidergic targets, and then analyzed these tables according several questions such as: Are some particular behavioral tests used in these studies? Which genetic method has been used? Which phenotypes are observed? Can these results be explained by the species or the strain used? Did this strategy enable to precise the brain area involved in these processes? Is the contribution of the genetic factor limited to the developmental period? Do the effects of the mutation correlate with the results of pharmacological challenge? Does the mutation modify the response to anxiolytic or anxiogenic agents? We propose some conclusions on the genes involved in normal and pathological anxiety behavior.
