Najar, F., et al. (2015). "The involvement of medial septum 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors on ACPA-induced memory consolidation deficit: Possible role of TRPC3, TRPC6 and TRPV2." Journal of Psychopharmacology 29(11): 1200-1208.

	The present study evaluates the roles of serotonergic receptors of the medial septum on amnesia induced by arachidonylcyclopropylamide (ACPA; as selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) in adult male Wistar rats. Cannulae were implanted in the medial septum of the brain of the rats. The animals were trained in a passive avoidance learning apparatus, and were tested 24 hours after training for step-through latency. Results indicated that post-training medial septum administration of CP94253 (5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist) and cinancerine (as 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) reduced the step-through latency showing an amnesic response, while GR127935 (5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist) and m5htm (as 5-HT2A/2B/2D receptor agonist) did not alter memory consolidation by themselves. On continuing the test, the results showed that CP94253 increased and GR127935 did not alter ACPA (0.02 mu g/rat)-induced memory impairment, respectively. Other data indicated that m5htm induced a modulatory effect, while cinancerine restored ACPA-induced amnesia. Using SKF-96365 (inhibitor of transient receptor potential TRPC3/6 and TRPV2 channels) demonstrated that TRPC3, TRPC3 and TRPV2 channels have a significant role, according to our results.
