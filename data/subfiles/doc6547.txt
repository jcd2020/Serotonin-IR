King, G. R., et al. (1999). "Withdrawal from continuous cocaine administration: time dependent changes in accumbens 5-HT3 receptor function and behavioral tolerance." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 142(4): 352-359.

	We have previously reported that continuous cocaine administration functionally down regulates 5-HT3 receptors in the nucleus accumbens. The current experiments evaluated the duration of behavioral tolerance to cocaine and whether the duration of behavioral tolerance and 5-HT3 receptor down-regulation covaried. Rats were withdrawn from a pretreatment regimen (40 mg/kg/per day cocaine or 0.9% saline for 14 days) for 1, 7 or 14 days. The rats were either sacrificed, and slices from the nucleus accumbens obtained, or were exposed to behavioral rating procedures. The results indicated that continuous cocaine administration significantly attenuated the ability of mCPBG to facilitate K+-stimulated DA release on days 1 and 7, but not day 14, of withdrawal. Furthermore, continuous cocaine administration induced behavioral tolerance to a cocaine challenge on days 1 and 7, but not day 14, of withdrawal. These results suggest that continuous cocaine administration functionally downregulates 5-HT3 receptors in the nucleus accumbens, and this functional down-regulation co-varies with the behavioral tolerance induced by continuous cocaine administration. Hence, a functional down-regulation of accumbens 5-HT3 receptors may represent a partial mechanism for the tolerance following continuous cocaine administration.
