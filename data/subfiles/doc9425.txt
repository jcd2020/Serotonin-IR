	Research in Alzheimer's disease is going through a big turnaround. New palliative therapies are being reconsidered for the effective management of disease because of setbacks in the development of disease-modifying therapies. Serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor has long been pursued as a potential target for the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. SUVN-502 is a novel 5-HT6 receptor antagonist (Ki=2.04 nmol/l) with high receptor affinity and high degree of selectivity. SUVN-502 at doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg, per os (p.o.) demonstrated procognitive effects in various behavioral animal models (object recognition task, water maze, and radial arm maze), and it acts on three phases of cognition, viz., acquisition, consolidation, and retention (object recognition task). SUVN-502 (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) modulated glutamate levels when administered alone (microdialysis). At doses ranging from 1 to 10 mg/kg p.o., SUVN-502 potentiated the effects of donepezil (microdialysis). SUVN-502 [1 mg/kg, intravenous (i.v.)] also potentiated pharmacological effects of memantine (1 mg/kg, i.v.) and/or donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) (theta modulation). The beneficial effects of SUVN-502 on learning and memory might be mediated through the modulation of cholinergic and/or glutamatergic neurotransmission in relevant brain regions. In summary, behavioral, neurochemical, and electrophysiological outcomes indicate that SUVN-502 may augment the beneficial effects of donepezil and memantine combination.
