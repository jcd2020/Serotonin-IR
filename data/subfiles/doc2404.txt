Dawson, L. A. and P. Li (2003). "Effects of 5-HT(6) receptor blockade on the neurochemical outcome of antidepressant treatment in the frontal cortex of the rat." J Neural Transm (Vienna) 110(6): 577-590.

	Using in vivo microdialysis in the freely moving rat we have examined the effects of 5-HT(6) receptor antagonism on the neurochemical outcome of antidepressant treatment. Acute administration of both desipramine (10 mg/kg s.c.) and venlafaxine (10 mg/kg s.c.) produced a 2 fold increase in extracellular noradrenaline (NA) but no change in frontal cortex dopamine (DaA), 5-HT or glutamate. Fluoxetine (20 mg/kg s.c.) produced no change in extracellular levels of any of the neurotransmitters examined. SB-271046 produced a 3 fold increase in extracellular glutamate. Combination treatment of SB-271046 with each antidepressant produced no change in the antidepressant-induced changes in NA, DA or 5-HT. In contrast, both fluoxetine and venlafaxine attenuated the SB-271046-induced increase in extracellular glutamate, suggesting that 5-HT and possibly NA may be having an inhibitory action on the excitatory pathways enhanced by 5-HT(6) receptor blockade. Furthermore, these data indicate that the neurochemical effects induced by NA and/or 5-HT reuptake inhibitors are not enhanced by 5-HT(6) receptor blockade indicating that 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists are unlikely to augment the therapeutic efficacy of these types of antidepressants.
