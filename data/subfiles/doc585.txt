Bali, A., et al. (2014). "Synthesis, docking and pharmacological evaluation of novel indole based potential atypical antipsychotics." Eur J Med Chem 74: 477-490.

	A series of substituted indole derivatives have been synthesized and the target compounds evaluated for atypical antipsychotic activity in apomorphine induced mesh climbing and stereotypy assays in mice. The compounds 11 and 12 have emerged as important lead compounds showing potential atypical antipsychotic profile. In silico (docking studies) have been carried out to postulate a hypothetical binding model for the target compounds with respect to the dopaminergic D2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Theoretical ADME profiling of the compounds based on selected physicochemical parameters has suggested an excellent compliance with Lipinski's rules. The potential of these compounds to penetrate the blood brain barrier (log BB) was computed through an online software program and the values obtained for the compounds suggest good potential for brain permeation.
