Ji, G. C. and V. Neugebauer (2019). "Contribution of Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor 1 (CRF1) to Serotonin Receptor 5-HT2CR Function in Amygdala Neurons in a Neuropathic Pain Model." International Journal of Molecular Sciences 20(18).

	The amygdala plays a key role in emotional-affective aspects of pain and in pain modulation. The central nucleus (CeA) serves major amygdala output functions related to emotional-affective behaviors and pain modulation. Our previous studies implicated the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system in amygdala plasticity and pain behaviors in an arthritis model. We also showed that serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtype 5-HT2CR in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) contributes to increased CeA output and neuropathic pain-like behaviors. Here, we tested the novel hypothesis that 5-HT2CR in the BLA drives CRF1 receptor activation to increase CeA neuronal activity in neuropathic pain. Extracellular single-unit recordings of CeA neurons in anesthetized adult male rats detected increased activity in neuropathic rats (spinal nerve ligation model) compared to sham controls. Increased CeA activity was blocked by local knockdown or pharmacological blockade of 5-HT2CR in the BLA, using stereotaxic administration of 5-HT2CR short hairpin RNA (shRNA) viral vector or a 5-HT2CR antagonist (SB242084), respectively. Stereotaxic administration of a CRF1 receptor antagonist (NBI27914) into the BLA also decreased CeA activity in neuropathic rats and blocked the facilitatory effects of a 5-HT2CR agonist (WAY161503) administered stereotaxically into the BLA. Conversely, local (BLA) knockdown of 5-HT2CR eliminated the inhibitory effect of NBI27914 and the facilitatory effect of WAY161503 in neuropathic rats. The data suggest that 5-HT2CR activation in the BLA contributes to neuropathic pain-related amygdala (CeA) activity by engaging CRF1 receptor signaling.
