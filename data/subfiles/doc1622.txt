	The psychostimulant effects of cocaine critically depend on the serotonergic (5-HT) system, of which the 5-HT1A receptor is an essential component. We recently showed divergent contributions of various pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor populations to the behavioral effects of cocaine. Here, we further investigate the role of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the acute and chronic stimulant effects of cocaine using 5-HT1A receptor ligands in autoreceptor preferring doses. In experiment 1, four groups of rats (N = 10) received either saline or the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OHDPAT (0.05 mg/kg) 20 min prior to a saline or cocaine (10 mg/kg) injection on 9 consecutive days. In experiment 2, six groups (N = 10) were given either saline, the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.05 mg/kg) or 8-OHDPAT (0.05 mg/kg) plus WAY 100635 (0.05 mg/kg) 20 min before a saline or cocaine (10.0 mg/kg) treatment on 9 consecutive days. Initially, both the 8-OHDPAT and WAY 100635 pretreatments completely blocked the locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine whereas the combined 8-OHDPAT plus WAY 100635 pretreatment had no effect. In saline treated groups, neither the WAY 100635 nor the 8-OHDPAT plus WAY 100635 pretreatment influenced spontaneous activity levels, whereas the 8-OHDPAT alone severely reduced spontaneous activity. These effects persisted over the course of the 9 test sessions. A different pattern of results was obtained for the cocaine treatment groups. With repeated treatments, the WAY 100635 treatment always blocked the locomotor activation effect of cocaine, whereas the effects of 8-OHDPAT were transformed from an inhibition to an enhancement of cocaine locomotor stimulation. The combined 8-OHDPAT plus WAY 100635 pretreatment did not affect the stimulant effect of cocaine. These findings demonstrate that low dose autoreceptor preferring treatments with a 5-HT1A agonist and antagonist can strongly modify the behavioral stimulant effects of cocaine and suggest that the 5-HT1A autoreceptor may be an important pharmacological target for the development of treatments for cocaine addiction.
