Davidson, C., et al. (2002). "5-HT2 receptor antagonists given in the acute withdrawal from daily cocaine injections can reverse established sensitization." European Journal of Pharmacology 453(2-3): 255-263.

	Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given two separate sensitizing regimens of cocaine (7 days on, 7 days off, 7 days on at 40 mg/kg/day, s.c.) or saline injections. Half of the animals also received a drug with 5-hydroxytryptamine-2 (5-HT2) receptor antagonist properties (clozapine, 3 mg/kg; mianserin 6 mg/kg, ketanserin 1 mg/kg, all s.c.) or saline during the second cocaine dosing regimen in the acute withdrawal period, 3.5 h after each cocaine injection. On day 10 of withdrawal animals were challenged with cocaine (7.5 mg/kg, i.p.) and assessed by a behavioral rating scale and locomotor activity monitoring. The 5-HT2, receptor antagonists, but not saline, reversed behavioral sensitization and had little effect on behavior in the control animals. 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, therefore, may be a useful treatment for cocaine addicts that have undergone previous sensitization periods. The pharmacological profile of these antagonists suggests that the 5-HT2A receptor subtype may mediate this effect. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
