Bowers, B. J., et al. (2006). "Regulation of 5-HT2A/C receptors and DOI-induced behaviors by protein kinase Cgamma." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 85(2): 441-447.

	Protein kinase Cgamma (PKCgamma) null mutant mice demonstrate increased behavioral impulsivity and ethanol consumption. Pharmacological studies have shown that 5-HT(2A/C) receptors modulate impulsivity and ethanol consumption in rodents and that PKC can regulate 5-HT(2A/C) receptors. To determine whether PKCgamma plays a selective role in 5-HT(2A/C) receptor regulation, biochemical and behavioral experiments were performed in PKCgamma mutant and wild-type mice. DOI-stimulated phosphoinositol hydrolysis and [(125)I]-DOI saturation binding in the PFC, and quantitative autoradiography of [(125)I]-DOI binding sites in 15 brain regions were analyzed. DOI-induced head twitch responses (HTR) were measured in naive mice after an acute 2.5 mg/kg injection of DOI. Results indicated that DOI-induced HTR was significantly greater in mutant mice compared to wild-type mice. Results of the phosphoinositol hydrolysis, membrane binding, and autoradiography experiments indicated that in mutant mice, increased HTR was associated with increased 5-HT(2A/C) receptor function in the PFC, but not increased receptor number or affinity suggesting that PKCgamma regulates receptor function but not receptor number. These data support a role for 5-HT(2A/C) receptors in the PFC in mediating some of the behavioral differences observed between PKCgamma mutant and wild-type mice.
