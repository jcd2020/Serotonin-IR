Quaglia, W., et al. (1999). "Structure-activity relationships in 1,4-benzodioxan-related compounds. 6. Role of the dioxane unit on selectivity for alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor subtypes." J Med Chem 42(15): 2961-2968.

	WB 4101-related benzodioxans 3-9 were synthesized, and their biological profiles at alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor subtypes and 5-HT(1A) serotoninergic receptors were assessed by binding assays in CHO and HeLa cells membranes expressing the human cloned receptors. Furthermore, receptor selectivity of selected benzodioxan derivatives was further determined in functional experiments in isolated rat vas deferens (alpha(1A)) and aorta (alpha(1D)) and guinea pig spleen (alpha(1B)), in additional receptor binding assays in rat cortex membranes containing alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors and 5-HT(2) serotoninergic receptors, and in rat striatum membranes containing D(2) dopaminergic receptors. An analysis of the results of receptor binding experiments for benzodioxan-modified derivatives 3-9 showed high affinity and selectivity toward the alpha(1a)-adrenoreceptor subtype for compounds 3-5 and 7 and a reversed selectivity profile for 9, which was a selective alpha(1d) antagonist. Furthermore, the majority of structural modifications performed on the prototype 1 (WB 4101) led to a marked decrease in the affinity for 5-HT(1A) serotoninergic receptors, which may have relevance in the design of selective alpha(1A)-adrenoreceptor antagonists. The exception to these findings was the chromene derivative 8, which exhibited a 5-HT(1A) partial agonist profile.
