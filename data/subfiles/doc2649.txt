Di Matteo, V., et al. (1998). "Selective blockade of serotonin2C/2B receptors enhances dopamine release in the rat nucleus accumbens." Neuropharmacology 37(2): 265-272.

	The effects of mesulergine (100 and 200 microg/kg s.c.), SB 206553 (1 and 2.5 mg/kg i.p.), RP 62203 (2.5 and 4 mg/kg i.p.) and ritanserin (630 microg/kg i.p.) were studied on the extracellular concentration of dopamine (DA) and dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the nucleus accumbens of chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats, using intracerebral microdialysis. Mesulergine, a non selective serotonin2C/2B/2A (5-HT2C/2B/2A) receptor antagonist, significantly increased DA release, which reached a peak level (+ 20%) 60 min after drug injection and slowly returned back to baseline values. Mesulergine also caused a dose-dependent increase in DOPAC outflow. Pretreatment with mesulergine (200 microg/kg) did not change the inhibition of DA release induced by apomorphine (100 microg/kg), whereas it prevented the reduction of DOPAC outflow induced by apomorphine (100 microg/kg). Administration of SB 206553, a selective blocker of 5-HT2C/2B receptors, dose-dependently increased DA outflow. The dose of 2.5 mg/kg SB 206553 caused a linear increase of DA output which reached a peak (+75%) 40 min after injection, while 1 mg/kg induced a more gradual increase of DA release which peaked (+54%) 60 min after administration of the drug. Treatment with RP 62203, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, did not produce any significant effect on DA outflow. Administration of ritanserin, a mixed 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, did not cause any significant change of DA and DOPAC outflow. Taken together, these data indicate that selective blockade of 5-HT2/2B receptor subtypes increases DA release in the rat nucleus accumbens.
