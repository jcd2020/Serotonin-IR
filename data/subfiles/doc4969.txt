	Background/Aims: Atypical antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine are known to induce metabolic disturbance. We have already shown that olanzapine induces hepatic glucose production through the activation of hypothalamic adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). However, it is unclear how olanzapine activates hypothalamic AMPK. Since olanzapine is known to antagonize several receptors, including histaminergic, muscarinic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors, we examined the effect of each receptor antagonist on blood glucose levels in mice. Moreover, we also investigated whether these antagonists activate hypothalamic AMPK. Methods: Male 6-week-old ICR mice were used. Blood glucose levels were determined by the glucose oxidase method. AMPK expression was measured by Western blotting. Results: Central administration of olanzapine (5-15 nmol i.c.v.) dose-dependently increased blood glucose levels in mice, whereas olanzapine did not change blood insulin levels. Histamine H1 receptor antagonist chlorphenira- mine (1-10 pg i.c.v.), dopamine D2 receptor antagonist L-sulpiride (1-10 pg i.c.v.) and aradrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (0.3-3 pg i.c.v.) also significantly increased blood glucose levels in mice. In contrast, the blood glucose levels were not affected by nnuscarinic M1 receptor antagonist dicyclomine (110 pg i.c.v.) or serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 (1-10 ng i.c.v.). Olanzapine-induced hyperglycemia was inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor compound C, and AMPK activator AICAR (10 ng to 1 pg i.c.v.) significantly increased blood glucose levels. Olanzapine (15 nnnol), chlorpheniramine (10 pg), L-sulpiride (10 pg) and prazosin (3 pg) significantly increased phosphorylated AMPK in the hypothalamus of mice. Condusion:These results suggest that olanzapine activates hypothalamic AMPK by antagonizing histamine H1 receptors, dopamine D2 receptors and alpha(1)-aradrenoceptors, which induces hyperglycemia.
