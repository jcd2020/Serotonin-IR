	The serotonin-6 (5-HT6) receptor is the most recently discovered serotonin receptor, and it represents an increasingly promising target for improving cognition in both normal and disease states. Recently, a new selective 5-HT6 receptor agonist, 2-(5 chloro-2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine (ST1936), with nanomolar affinity for 5-HT6 receptors was described. We performed in-vivo electrophysiological studies to investigate the physiological role of 5-HT6 receptors in the control of the function of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA). Extracellular single-unit recordings were performed from putative dopamine-containing neurons in the SNc and VTA of anesthetised rats. In the SNc, acute systemic administration of ST1936 had no effects on basal firing activity of these dopamine neurons; however, in the VTA, ST1936 induced either dose-related increases (45% of cells) or decreases in basal activity of these dopaminergic neurons. Local application of ST1936 into the VTA caused excitation in all of the dopamine neurons, but had no effects on non-dopamine VTA neurons. Both effects of systemic and microiontophoretic ST1936 were completely reversed by the potent and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist 5-chloro-N-(4-methoxy-3-piperazin-1-ylphenyl)-3-methyl-2- benzothiophene-sulfonamide (SB271046). Systemic application of another 5-HT6 agonist, 2-(1-{6-chloroimidazo[2,1-b] [1,3]thiazole-5-sulfonyl}-1H-indol-3-yl)ethan-1-amine (WAY-181187), induced dose-dependent inhibition of these VTA dopaminergic neurons. ST1936 and WAY-181187 appear to have different effects on these VTA dopaminergic neurons, potentially due to different mechanisms of action or to the complexity of 5-HT6 receptor functions. Our data demonstrate the need for further investigations into the use of 5-HT6 receptor agonists to control cognitive disfunction, such as in schizophrenia and depression.
