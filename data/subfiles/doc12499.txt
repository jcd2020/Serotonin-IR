	The 5-HT, receptor antagonist properties of the novel compound L-683,877 (-) (2'-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-)spiro(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3,5'(4'H)-oxazole) have been characterised in vitro and in vivo. In radioligand binding studies, L-683,877 displaced [H-3]quaternized ICS 205-930 binding to membranes of rat cortex with a pK(i) of 8.71. L-683,877 was essentially inactive (pK(i) < 5) at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2, and dopamine D1 and D2 binding sites. In the rat isolated vagus nerve and superior cervical ganglion (SCG) preparations, L-683,877 antagonized 5-HT3 agonist-induced depolarizations with apparent pK(B) values of 9.30 and 8.25, respectively. Similarly L-683,877 antagonized the positive chronotropic effects of 5-HT in the isolated rabbit heart preparation (apparent pK(B) 10.10). In the anaesthetized rat, L-683,877 (10-100-mu-g kg-1 i.v.) antagonized the Bezold Jarisch reflex evoked by 5-HT; at a dose of 10-mu-g kg-1 i.v. L-683,877 caused a twofold shift in the dose response curve. The retching and vomiting response induced in the ferret by cisplatin (10 mg kg-1 i.v.), was markedly attenuated by L-683,877 (0.1 mg kg-1 i.v. and p.o.) and completely prevented by higher doses (10 mg kg-1 i.v. and p.o.). These data indicate that L-683,877 is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.
