Franchini, S., et al. (2017). "Synthesis, biological evaluation and molecular modeling of 1-oxa-4-thiaspiro- and 1,4-dithiaspiro[4.5]decane derivatives as potent and selective 5-HT1A receptor agonists." Eur J Med Chem 125: 435-452.

	Recently, 1-(1,4-dioxaspiro[4,5]dec-2-ylmethyl)-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (1) was reported as a potent 5-HT1AR agonist with a moderate 5-HT1AR selectivity. In an extension of this work a series of derivatives of 1, obtained by combining different heterocyclic rings with a more flexible amine chain, was synthesized and tested for binding affinity and activity at 5-HT1AR and alpha1 adrenoceptors. The results led to the identification of 14 and 15 as novel 5-HT1AR partial agonists, the first being outstanding for selectivity (5-HT1A/alpha1d = 80), the latter for potency (pD2 = 9.58) and efficacy (Emax = 74%). Theoretical studies of ADME properties shows a good profile for the entire series and MDCKII-MDR1 cells permeability data predict a good BBB permeability of compound 15, which possess a promising neuroprotective activity. Furthermore, in mouse formalin test, compound 15 shows a potent antinociceptive activity suggesting a new strategy for pain control.
