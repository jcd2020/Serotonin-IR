	Our previous findings in female rats suggest that the potent effects of sex steroids on mood and mental state may be mediated, in part, by the effect of estrogen on the 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor (5-HT2AR) in brain. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of acute (approximately 32h) sex steroid manipulation on central 5-HT2AR in the adult male Wistar rat. Castration (under halothane anesthesia) decreased while testosterone or estrogen, but not 5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (5alpha-DHT), increased significantly the 5-HT2AR mRNA content in dorsal raphe nucleus and the density of 5-HT2AR binding sites in frontal, cingulate and primary olfactory cortex and nucleus accumbens. The lack of effect of 5alpha-DHT, a potent androgen which cannot be converted to estrogen, suggests that the action of testosterone depends upon its conversion to estrogen by aromatase. This may also explain why estrogen, but not testosterone or 5alpha-DHT, increased the density of 5-HT2AR binding sites in the caudate-putamen, a brain region where aromatase is scarce. These findings are discussed in relation to the possible role of the 5-HT2AR in depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease.
