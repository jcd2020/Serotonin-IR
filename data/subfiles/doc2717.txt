	Slow-wave sleep is defined as sleep stages 3 and 4 that characteristically show slow delta EEG activity during polysomnography. The percentage of slow-wave sleep normally declines with age. Sleep disorders are a common symptom of many psychiatric disorders. In polysomnographic recordings they mostly manifest as disturbances of sleep continuity. In some disorders changes in REM sleep are also found. A reduction of slow-wave sleep has most often been described in patients with depression and addictive disorders. More recent research implicates slow-wave sleep as an important factor in memory consolidation, especially the contents of declarative memory. Psychotropic drugs influence sleep in different ways. Hypnotic substances can reduce the deep sleep stages (e.g. benzodiazepines), whereas 5-HT2C antagonists increase the percentage of slow-wave sleep. Whether a selective impairment/alteration of slow-wave sleep is clinically relevant has not yet been proved.
