Majczynski, H., et al. (2005). "Serotonin-related enhancement of recovery of hind limb motor functions in spinal rats after grafting of embryonic raphe nuclei." J Neurotrauma 22(5): 590-604.

	Recently, we demonstrated improvements in hind limb locomotor-like movements following grafting of embryonic raphe nuclei cells into the spinal cord below the level of total transection in adult rats. The purpose of the present study was to clarify whether this improvement was due to newly established serotonergic innervation between the graft and the host. Two months after intraspinal grafting of the embryonic raphe nuclei, the spinalized rats, when put on a treadmill, could be induced to walk with regular alternating hind limb movements with the plantar contact with the ground during the stance phase, and ankle dorsiflexion during the swing phase of each step cycle. In the same situation the spinal rats, that did not receive the graft, were not able to initiate the dorsiflexion of the ankle joint during the swing phase and very often the dorsal surface of the foot was dragged along the ground. Intraperitoneal application of directly acting 5-HT2 antagonist Cyproheptadine (1 mg/kg) impaired reversibly the hind limb locomotor-like movements in grafted rats. This impairment lasted for 2-3 h. The same procedure in control rats did not markedly alter the hind limb locomotor-like movements. The effect of Cyproheptadine in grafted rats was reversed by i.p. injections of the 5-HT2 agonist Quipazine (0.5 mg/kg). These results show that the graft-induced restitution of hind limb locomotor abilities in adult spinal rats is brought about by the new serotonergic innervation of the host spinal cord circuitry from the grafted neurons and is mediated by 5-HT2 receptors.
