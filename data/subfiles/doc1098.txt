Boer, G. J., et al. (1993). "ALPHA-2-ADRENOCEPTOR ASSAYED IN RAT-BRAIN BY THE NEW LIGAND H-3 RX821002." Biogenic Amines 9(4): 259-269.

	Binding of the new alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist ligand [H-3]RX821002 was investigated in crude membrane fractions of rat brain regions. Membranes prepared from the amygdala/piriform cortex area were used to characterize binding which was found to be saturable with a single high affinity binding site revealing a K(d) of 0.9 nM, a very low percentage of non-specific binding and a rapid association/dissociation. Twenty-four drugs, among which 11 known alpha2-adrenergic compounds, were used in subsequent displacement studies and confirmed the probable alpha2A-selectivity of binding with the order of displacement potency oxymetazoline > phentolamine > prazosin > isoprotenerol. [H-3]RX821002 did not label non-adrenergic ''imidazole-preferring'' binding sites, nor could binding to alpha2B-adrenergic sites be seen. The reported binding to 5-HT1A binding sites in the brain could not be established either. The distribution of alpha2-adrenoceptor density revealed the highest levels in the amygdala/piriform cortex (B(max) 156 fmol/mg protein) and the lowest levels in the medulla/pons area (21 fmol/mg). The study shows that [H-3]RX821002 is a powerful ligand, allowing specific and sensitive assay of alpha2-adrenoceptors in rat brain, too, as it has been shown for a variety of other tissues.
