Elliott, J. and G. P. Reynolds (1999). "Agonist-stimulated GTP gamma S-35 binding to 5-HT1A receptors in human post-mortem brain." Eur J Pharmacol 386(2-3): 313-315.

	In this study, we have demonstrated that the technique of agonist-stimulated guanosine-5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)-triphosphate (GTP gamma[S-35]) binding can be successfully used to study the functional activity of the human 5-HT1A receptor in post-mortem tissue. Full agonist and antagonist actions of ligands specific for this site have been shown. Utilising 4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-( n-2"-pyridinyl)-p-fluorobenzamido]-ethyl-piperazine ([H-3]MPPF), the affinity of several antipsychotics for the 5-HT1A receptor was determined; clozapine and quetiapine were found to have K-i values at this receptor that, relative to their dopamine D-2 receptor affinities, indicated at least partial receptor occupancy at clinical doses. The agonist/antagonist activity of these two antipsychotics was studied using GTP gamma[S-35] binding. Both compounds show partial agonism, and in addition, clozapine exhibited a larger degree of antagonism against 5-HT-stimulated binding than did quetiapine. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
