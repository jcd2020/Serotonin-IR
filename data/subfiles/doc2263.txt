Currie, P. J. and D. V. Coscina (1997). "Stimulation of 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors within specific hypothalamic nuclei differentially antagonizes NPY-induced feeding." Neuroreport 8(17): 3759-3762.

	The present study examined the impact of the 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) on the feeding-stimulant action of neuropeptide Y (NPY) injected into three hypothalamic sites, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the perifornical hypothalamus (PFH) and the ventromedial nucleus (VMH). Injections of NPY (100-200 pmol) into each region potentiated food intake. Pretreatment with DOI (5-20 nmol) into the PVN effectively suppressed feeding elicited by PVN NPY (100 pmol). In contrast, DOI injections into the PFH and VMH failed to modify NPY-stimulated eating. This suggests that 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor modulation of NPY feeding within the hypothalamus is localized to the PVN.
