Artaiz, I., et al. (2005). "Preclinical pharmacology of F-98214-TA, a novel potent serotonin and norepinephrine uptake inhibitor with antidepressant and anxiolytic properties." Psychopharmacology 182(3): 400-413.

	Rationale: Serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been proposed to have a higher efficacy and/or faster onset of action than previously available antidepressants. Objectives: We examined in biochemical, electrophysiological and behavioural assays the antidepressant properties of (S)-(-)-4+3fluorophenoxy)-phenyl]methyl-piperidine (F-98214-TA), a compound that displays very high affinity for 5-HT and NE transporters. Results: F-98214-TA potently inhibited the uptake of both 5-HT and NE into rat brain synaptosomes (IC50=1.9 and 11.2 nM, respectively) and decreased the electrical activity of dorsal raphe serotonergic neurones (ED50=530.3 mu g/kg i.v.), an effect completely abolished by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100,635. In acute behavioural assays in mice, the orally administered compound potentiated the 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-HTP)-induced syndrome [minimal effective dose (MED)=10 mg/kg], antagonized the hypothermia induced by a high dose of apomorphine (ED50=2 mg/kg) and reduced the immobility in the tall suspension test (MED= 10 mg/kg). Moreover, it also decreased the immobility in the forced swimming test in mice and rats (30 mg/kg, p.o.). Chronic administration of F-98214-TA (14 days, 30 mg kg(-1) day(-1) p.o.) attenuated the hyperactivity induced by olfactory bulbectomy in rats, confirming its antidepressant-like properties. Interestingly, the same dosage regimen significantly increased the social interaction time in rats, suggesting an additional potential anxiolytic activity. In most assays the compound was more potent than fluoxetine, venlafaxine and desipramine. Conclusions: F-98214-TA is a novel SNRI that displays greater potency than other reference antidepressants in animal models predictive of antidepressant and anxiolytic activities.
