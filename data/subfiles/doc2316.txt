	An attempt to determine the central site of the sympathoinhibitory effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, has been made in normotensive anesthetized dogs. Intravenous and central (cisterna magna, vertebral artery) administration of 8-OH-DPAT induced dose-dependent decreases in blood pressure and sympathetic (splanchnic and renal) nerve activity in intact and baroreceptor denervated dogs. In contrast, 8-OH-DPAT was ineffective when injected into the nucleus tractus solitarii or into the raphe nuclei. Administration of 8-OH-DPAT into the ventrolateral pressor area (VLPA) decreased blood pressure and renal sympathetic nerve activity. The sympathoinhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT injected into the vertebral artery (v.a.) were antagonized by methiothepin and (+/-)pindolol injected into the v.a. Likewise, the effects of 8-OH-DPAT administered into the VLPA were antagonized by methiothepin injected into the same site. Depletion of central catecholamines and 5-HT content did not change the sympathoinhibitory effects of 8-OH-DPAT. These results suggested that 8-OH-DPAT has a direct effect on 5-HT1A receptors located in the VLPA in dogs.
