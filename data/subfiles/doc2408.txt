Dawson, L. A., et al. (2001). "The 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-271046 selectively enhances excitatory neurotransmission in the rat frontal cortex and hippocampus." Neuropsychopharmacology 25(5): 662-668.

	Preclinical evidence has suggested a possible role for the 5-HT6 receptor in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction. However, currently there is little neurochemical evidence suggesting the mechanism(s) which may be involved. Using the selective 5-HT6 antagonist SB-271046 and in vivo microdialysis, we have evaluated the effects of this compound on the modulation of basal neurotransmitter release within multiple brain regions of the freely moving rat. SB-271046 produced no change in basal levels of dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE) or 5-HT in the Striatum, frontal cortex, dorsal hippocampus or nucleus accumbens. Similarly, this compound had no effect on excitatory neurotransmission in the striatum or nucleus accumbens. Conversely, SB-271046 produced 3- and 2-fold increases in extracellular glutamate levels in both frontal cortex and dorsal hippocampus, respectively. These effects were completely attenuated by infusion of tetrodotoxin but unaffected by the muscarinic antagonist, atropine. Here we demonstrate for the first time the selective enhancement of excitatory neurotransmission by SB-271046 in those brain regions implicated in cognitive and memory function, and provide mechanistic evidence in support of a possible therapeutic role for 5-HT6 receptor antagonists in the treatment of cognitive and memory dysfunction.
