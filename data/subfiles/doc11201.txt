Salmi, P., et al. (1994). "Antagonism by SCH 23390 of clozapine-induced hypothermia in the rat." Eur J Pharmacol 253(1-2): 67-73.

	Clozapine (7.5-30.0 mumol kg-1 s.c.) produced a decrease in core temperature in the rat. The temperature decrease caused by clozapine (7.5 mumol kg-1 s.c.) was fully antagonized by the selective dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.3 mumol kg-1) s.c.) and a partial antagonism was obtained by the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride (1.6 mumol kg-1 s.c.). On the other hand, the hypothermia was not antagonized by alpha-adrenoceptor antagonists (idazoxan and prazosin), 5-HT receptor antagonists ((-)-pindolol and ritanserin) or by the muscarinic M1 receptor antagonist scopolamine. The hyperthermia produced by the 5-HT1C/2 receptor agonist DOI (0.75 mumol kg-1) was blocked by clozapine (3.0 mumol kg-1 s.c.). Clozapine did not antagonize hypothermia produced by selective dopamine D1 and D2 receptor agonists (A 68930 and quinpirole), the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) or the muscarinic M1 receptor agonist oxotremorine. The present results suggest that clozapine may be a partial agonist at brain dopamine D1 receptors.
