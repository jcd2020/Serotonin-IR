Yamada, J., et al. (2001). "Role of 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in depletion of 5-HT induced by p-chloroamphetamine in the mouse frontal cortex." Brain Res 911(2): 141-145.

	A serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)-releasing drug, p-chloroamphetamine elicited decreases in 5-HT levels in the mouse frontal cortex. 5-HT reduction elicited by p-chloroamphetamine was inhibited by the 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptor antagonist, LY 53857 and the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin. However, the 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonist, SB 206553, enhanced it. LY 53857 and ketanserin can inhibit hyperthermia elicited by p-chloroamphetamine, although SB 206553 enhances it. The effects of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists on neurotoxicity are very similar to those on hyperthermia. Since hyperthermia facilitates neurotoxicity induced by amphetamine analogue, these 5-HT2 receptor antagonists may modify 5-HT depletion induced by p-chloroamphetamine through responses to body temperature.
