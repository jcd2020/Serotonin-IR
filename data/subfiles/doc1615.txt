	The cognitive-enhancing potential of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, was investigated in a model of cognitive impairment induced by the muscarinic receptor antagonist, scopolamine. For this purpose, marmosets were trained in an object discrimination task utilizing the Wisconsin General Test Apparatus. Administration of scopolamine (0.01-0.04 mg/kg, SC) caused a dose-dependent impairment in the acquisition of the object discrimination task in that marmosets required more trials to reach criterion, made more errors, and took longer to choose the objects. Administration of arecoline (0.06-0.1 mg/kg, SC) or 1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-9-methyl-3-[(2-methyl-1H-imidazol-1-yl)methyl]-4H-carbazol-4-one,HCl.2H2O (ondansetron) (0.1-1-mu-g/kg, SC) prevented the scopolamine-induced impairment in task acquisition in that the performance of marmosets was indistinguishable from that of saline-treated animals and was significantly better than that following scopolamine/saline. From these studies, we conclude that ondansetron prevents impairment in the cognitive performance of marmosets induced by administration of scopolamine.
