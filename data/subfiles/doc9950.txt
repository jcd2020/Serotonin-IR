	Regional distributions of ligand binding sites of 12 different neurotransmitter receptors (glutamatergic: AMPA, kainate, NDMA; GABAergic: GABA(A), GABA(B); cholinergic: muscarinic M2, nicotinic; adrenergic: alpha(1), alpha(2); serotonergic: 5-HT1A, 5-HT2; dopaminergic: D1) were studied in human postmortem brains by means of quantitative receptor autoradiography. Binding site densities were measured in the superior parietal lobule (SPL) (areas 5L, 5M, 5Ci, and different locations within Brodmann's area (BA) 7), somatosensory (BA 2), and visual cortical areas (BA 17, and different locations within BAs 18 and 19). Similarities of receptor distribution between cortical areas were analyzed by cluster analysis, uni- and multivariate statistics of mean receptor densities (averaged over all cortical layers), and profiles representing the laminar distribution patterns of receptors. A considerable heterogeneity of regional receptor densities and laminar patterns between the sites was found in the SPL and the visual cortex. The most prominent regional differences were found for M2 receptors. In the SPL, rostrocaudally oriented changes of receptor densities were more pronounced than those in mediolateral direction. The receptor distribution in the rostral SPL was more similar to that of the somatosensory cortex, whereas caudal SPL resembled the receptor patterns of the dorsolateral extrastriate visual areas. These results suggest a segregation of the different SPL areas based on receptor distribution features typical for somatosensory or visual areas, which fits to the dual functional role of this cortical region, i.e., the involvement of the human SPL in visuomotor and somatosensory motor transformations.
