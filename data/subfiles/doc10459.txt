Pullarkat, S. R., et al. (1998). "Coupling of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-2) and p70 S6 kinase signaling systems." J Neurochem 71(3): 1059-1067.

	Little is known about the coupling of serotonin 5-HT1B receptors to cellular signals other than cyclic AMP, In the present studies, the activation by 5-HT1B receptors of p70 S6 kinase and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) ERK-2 was investigated. Studies were performed by using both nontransfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which express endogenous receptors at a very low density, and a stable transfected CHO cell line expressing 5-MT1B receptors at 230 fmol/mg of membrane protein, a density similar to that expressed in cortex. In nontransfected cells, 5-HT was found to stimulate a greater than twofold increase in MAP kinase activity with an EC50 of 20 nM, Reflecting increased density of receptors, 5-HT caused a greater than eightfold activation of ERK-2 in transfected cells with an EC50 of 2 nM. 5-HT was found to also stimulate p70 S6 kinase in both nontransfected and transfected cells. The stimulation was sixfold in both types of cells, but the ECS, for 5-HT was fourfold lower in transfected cells. The coupling of 5-HT1B receptors to ERK-2 and to p70 S6 kinase was inhibited by pertussis toxin, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and by the inhibitor of MAP kinase kinase PD098059. Activation of p70 S6 kinase, but not ERK-2, was also inhibited by rapamycin. These findings demonstrate that 5-MT1B receptors couple to ERK-2 and p70 S6 kinase through overlapping, but noniclentical, pathways.
