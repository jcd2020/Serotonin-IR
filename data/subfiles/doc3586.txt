Garabette, M. L., et al. (2000). "Circadian variation in the activity of the 5-HT1B autoreceptor in the region of the suprachiasmatic nucleus, measured by microdialysis in the conscious freely-moving rat." British Journal of Pharmacology 131(8): 1569-1576.

	1 Intracerebral microdialysis was used to examine the function of the terminal 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) (5-HT1B) autoreceptor in the region of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of freely moving conscious rats at six time points or zeitgeber times (ZTs) across the light:dark cycle. 2 Infusion of the 5-HT1A/1B agonist 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-1H-indole (RU24969) (1 muM) via the microdialysis probe produced a decrease in 5-HT output when applied at ZTs 3, 6, 15 and 21 (69.8 +/- 11.9, 59 +/- 11.7, 43.9 +/- 17.2 and 45.7 +/- 17.0% respectively). At ZTs 9 and 18 RU24969 (1 mum) failed to affect the 5-HT output significantly (28.0 +/- 11 and 32.8 +/- 24.6% decrease respectively). 3 The profile of inhibition of 5-HT output following infusion of RU24969 (1 muM) at ZT 6 was unaffected by concurrent infusion of the specific 5-HT1A antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY100635) (1 muM) (52.48 +/- 17.5% decrease). 4 The data demonstrate a circadian rhythm in the activity of the 5-HT1B autoreceptor in the region of the SCN.
