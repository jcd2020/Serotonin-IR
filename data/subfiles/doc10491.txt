	Systemic administration of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin HBr (8-OH-DPAT) increases waking and reduces slow wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in the freely; moving rat. The selective 5-HT1A antagonist 4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-(n-2"-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]-ethyl-piperazine (p-MPPI) induces a dose-related decrease in REM sleep. The present study examined p-MPPI's potential as an antagonist of the sleep and waking responses elicited by 8-OH-DPAT. Also, the experiments explored the ability of p-MPPI to block behavioural reactions of the 5-HT syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT, and whether p-MPPI induced any behavioural effects of its own. This study demonstrated that pre-treatment with p-MPPI (5 mg/kg intraperitoneal (i.p.)) 30 min before 8-OH-DPAT (0.375 mg/kg subcutaneously (s.c.)) reduced the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on waking and REM sleep. Also, p-MPPI (5 and 10 mg/kg i.p.) reduced the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on locomotion and partially or completely antagonized hindlimb abduction and flat body posture. No overt behavioural change was produced by p-MPPI alone. Thus, p-MPPI behaved as a true 5-HT1A antagonist. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
