	Background: The aggregation of amyloid-beta (A beta) into insoluble plaques is a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous work has shown increasing serotonin levels with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) compounds reduces A beta in the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) in a mouse model of AD and in the cerebrospinal fluid of humans. We investigated which serotonin receptor (5-HTR) subtypes and downstream effectors were responsible for this reduction. Results: Agonists of 5-HT4R, 5-HT6R, and 5-HT7R significantly reduced ISF A beta, but agonists of other receptor subtypes did not. Additionally, inhibition of Protein Kinase A (PKA) blocked the effects of citalopram, an SSRI, on ISF A beta levels. Serotonin signaling does not appear to change gene expression to reduce A beta levels in acute timeframes, but likely acts within the cytoplasm to increase a-secretase enzymatic activity. Broad pharmacological inhibition of putative alpha-secretases increased ISF A beta and blocked the effects of citalopram. Conclusions: In total, these studies map the major signaling components linking serotonin receptors to suppression of brain ISF A beta. These results suggest the reduction in ISF A beta is mediated by a select group of 5-HTRs and open future avenues for targeted therapy of AD.
