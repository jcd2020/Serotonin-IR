Jesse, C. R., et al. (2010). "Evidence for the involvement of the serotonergic 5-HT2A/C and 5-HT3 receptors in the antidepressant-like effect caused by oral administration of bis selenide in mice." Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 34(2): 294-302.

	The present study investigated a possible antidepressant-like activity of bis selenide using two predictive tests for antidepressant effect on rodents: the forced swimming test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST). Bis selenide (0.5-5 mg/kg, p.o.) decreased the immobility time in the mouse FST and TST. The anti-immobility effect of bis selenide (1 mg/kg, p.o.) in the TST was prevented by the pretreatment of mice with p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA; 100 mg/kg, i.p., an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis), ketanserin ( 1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist), and ondasentron (11 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist). Pretreatment of mice with prazosin (1 mg/kg, i.p., an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist), yohimbine (I mg/kg, i.p.. an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), propranolol (2 mg/kg, i.p., beta-adrenoceptor antagonist), SCH23390 (0.05 mg/kg, s.c., a dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist), sulpiride (50 mg/kg, i.p., a dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist), or WAY 100635 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist) did not block the antidepressant-like effect of bis selenide ( I mg/kg, p.o.) in the TST. Administration of his selenide (0.1 mg/kg, p.o.) and fluoxetine (1 mg/kg), at subeffective doses, produced an antidepressant-like effect in the TST. Bis selenide did not alter Na+ K+ ATPase, MAO-A and MAO-B activities in whole brains of mice. Bis selenide produced an antidepressant-like effect in the mouse TST and FST, which may be related to the serotonergic system (5-HT2A/2C and 5-HT3 receptors). (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
