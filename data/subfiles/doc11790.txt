	Drugs such as PCP and MK-801 can cause psychotic reactions in humans by antagonizing NMDA receptors. This action is ultimately toxic to certain cortical neurons and may be one mechanism underlying neurodegenerative diseases, including schizophrenia. It has been reported that hallucinogens such as LSD, DOM, and DOI can block the neurotoxic effects of NMDA antagonists, possibly by activating inhibitory 5-HT2A receptors on GABAergic interneurons that normally inhibit glutamatergic projections to the retrosplenial and cingulate cortexes. The purpose of this experiment was to determine the extent to which similar drugs might also alter the behavioral effects of one NMDA antagonist, PCP. Rats were trained to discriminate this compound (2.5 mg/kg) from saline and were then given a series of antagonist tests. It was found that LSD (0.32 mg/kg) and DOM (4.0 mg/kg) blocked the PCP cue completely; DMT (8.0 mg/kg) and a structural congener of LSD, lisuride (LHM; 0.4 mg/kg), blocked the effects of PCP partially. The 5-HT/DA antagonists spiperone and ritanserin had no effect on the PCP cue. These data suggest that LSD, DOM, and, less effectively, DMT and LHM can block the behavioral as well as the neurotoxic effects of NMDA antagonists most likely through agonist actions at 5-HT2 receptors.
