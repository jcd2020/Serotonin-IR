	This paper summarizes our work on WAY-100635 and analogues, labeled either with carbon-11 or fluorine-18, as potential radioligands for the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) neuroreceptors. Other facets of our work include: (1) human studies with [O-methyl-C-11]WAY-100634, the major radioactive metabolite of [O-methyl-C-11]WAY-100635, and with [C-11]CPC 222; (2) use of a human liver metabolism model to screen in vitro potential metabolic problems in humans; (3) modification of the "dry method" to prepare [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635; and (4) validation studies in humans with [carbony-C-11]WAY-100635.
