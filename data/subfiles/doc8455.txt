	The analgesic effect of calcitonin when serotonin (5-HT) concentration is increased and the involvement of some 5-HT receptors were studied using the writhing test in mice. 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) administration increased both 5-HT levels in the central nervous system (CNS) and calcitonin analgesia. The 5-HT(1A) agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) diminished calcitonin analgesia, this effect being antagonised by the 5-HT(1A) antagonist (WAY 100, 135). As the stimulation of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors reduces the turnover of 5-HT, the effect of 8-OH-DPAT on calcitonin analgesia may be attributed to this decrease. The 5-HT(2A-2C) agonist (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI) diminished calcitonin analgesia. A sub-analgesic dose of the 5-HT(2A) antagonist ketanserin failed to prevent this effect. The 5-HT(3) agonist (+/-)-2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine maleate (2-methyl-5-HT) potentiated calcitonin analgesia, whereas it was significantly reduced by the 5-HT(3) antagonist tropisetron. The effect of 2-methyl-5-HT on calcitonin analgesia was also reversed by tropisetron, This result suggests that the 5-HT(3) receptor may play an important role in the relationship between calcitonin and the serotonergic system. Tropisetron also reversed the analgesia induced by calcitonin plus 5-HTP corroborating importance of the 5-HT(3) receptors.
