Nayak, S. V., et al. (2000). "Nicotinic receptors co-localize with 5-HT(3) serotonin receptors on striatal nerve terminals." Neuropharmacology 39(13): 2681-2690.

	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and 5-HT(3) serotonin receptors are present on presynaptic nerve terminals in the striatum, where they have been shown to be involved in the regulation of dopamine release. Here, we explored the possibility that both receptor systems function on the same individual nerve terminals in the striatum, as assessed by confocal imaging of synaptosomes. On performing sequential stimulation, nicotine (500 nM) induced changes in [Ca(2+)](i) in most of the synaptosomes ( approximately 80%) that had previously responded to stimulation with the 5-HT(3) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG; 100 nM), whereas mCPBG induced [Ca(2+)](i) responses in approximately half of the synaptosomes that showed responses on nicotinic stimulation. The 5-HT(3) receptor-specific antagonist tropisetron blocked only the mCPBG-induced responses, but not the nicotinic responses on the same synaptosomes. Immunocytochemical staining revealed extensive co-localization of the 5-HT(3) receptor with the alpha4 nicotinic receptor subunit on the same synaptosomes, but not with the alpha3 and/or alpha5 subunits. Immunoprecipitation studies indicate that the 5-HT(3) receptor and the alpha4 nicotinic receptor subunit do not interact on the nerve terminals. The presence of nicotinic and 5-HT(3) receptors on the same presynaptic striatal nerve terminal indicates a convergence of cholinergic and serotonergic systems in the striatum.
