	With the use of the degenerated nucleotides that contain the conserved sequence of G protein-coupled receptor, we have identified a 648-bp clone (HDGRC02) from human genomic DNA with significant sequence homology to human neurotransmitter receptors. HDGRC02 was then used as a probe for the screening of full length gene. From human Lambda DASH II genomic library, a 1.6 Kb clone encoded a full length gene was isolated and named putative neurotransmitter receptor (PNR). PNR has a single open reading frame which predicts a 38.3 KD protein of 338 amino acids with seven transmembrane domain topography. The amino acid sequence of PNR exhibits considerable homology to the rat 5-HR1D receptor with 35% amino acid identity and 56% amino acid similarity. PNR also shows significant sequence homology to the 5-HT1D receptor from Japanese puffer fish fugu, to the 5-HT4L receptor from mouse, to the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor and to the D2 dopamine receptor. Northern blot analysis indicates that PNR is expressed in skeletal muscle and selected areas of the brain. A chromosome mapping study located the PNR gene with human chromosome band of 6q23. The findings in the present study demonstrate that PNR is a putative neurotransmitter receptor.
