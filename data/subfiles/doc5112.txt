	1. A study was conducted to develop an in vitro model for examining the basal and electrical-stimulation-induced release of [H-3] monoamines from chicken hyperstriatal neurones in order to demonstrate the presence of presynaptic autoreceptors for the three main monoamine transmitters: noradrenaline, dopamine and 5-HT. 2. Two sets of experiments were carried out: the first was to evaluate the effect of calcium and tetrodotoxin (TTX, sodium channel conductance inhibitor) in order to demonstrate that evoked release of monoamines was a consequence of exocytotic processes; the second to investigate the effect of selective agonists and antagonists on neurotransmitter release. 3. Ross and Cobb broiler chickens of either sex (similar to 7 to 8 weeks old) were used. Slices of hyperstriatal tissue were preincubated with [H-3] noradrenaline, [H-3] dopamine or [H-3] 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), washed, perfused and electrically stimulated at three time points (S-1, S-2 and S-3) which released [H-3] noradrenaline, [H-3] dopamine and [H-3] 5-HT, as determined by scintillation spectrometry. 4. When calcium was removed from, or TTX added to, the superfusion medium prior to and including the second period of electrical stimulation (S-2) the evoked releases of [H-3] noradrenaline, [H-3] dopamine and [H-3] 5-HT at S-2 were abolished. 5. In the presence of the selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK 14304 during the S-2 period, the S-2/S-1 ratio was lower than the control ratio due to a reduction in the stimulated release of [H-3] noradrenaline. The selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist RX 821002 blocked the UK 14304-induced reduction of evoked release and the S-2/S-1 ratio was similar to the control ratio. 6. The D-2-like receptor agonist quinpirole reduced the S-2/S-1 ratio for [H-3] dopamine release, an effect blocked by the antagonist AJ 76. The 5-HT1B receptor agonist CP 94253 during S-2 reduced the S-2/S-1 ratio due to a reduction in evoked [H-3] 5-HT. This effect was blocked by the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist GR 55562. 7. The results demonstrate, for the first time, the functional presence of presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, presynaptic 5-HT1B autoreceptors and presynaptic D-2-like autoreceptors in broiler chicken hyperstriatal neurones in vitro.
