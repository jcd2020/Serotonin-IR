Daughters, R. S., et al. (2001). "Ondansetron attenuates CCK induced satiety and c-fos labeling in the dorsal medulla." Peptides 22(8): 1331-1338.

	Serotonin 5-HT(3) antagonists have been suggested for treatment of several disorders involving altered gastrointestinal (GI) function. CCK also has well documented GI actions on both food intake and vago-vagal reflexes. To evaluate potential interactions, the effect of a 5-HT(3) antagonist, ondansetron, on exogenous CCK induced satiety and c-fos activation was determined. Ondansetron reduced both actions of CCK by approximately 50%. The reduction in c-fos was localized to a specific subregion of the dorsal medulla, suggesting that a distinct subpopulation of CCK receptive fibers are modulated by 5-HT(3) ligands. Treatments using 5-HT(3) antagonists also may affect endogenous CCK functions.
