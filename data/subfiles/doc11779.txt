	The serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor has been under intense investigation, mostly due to its putative role in both the etiology and therapeutic treatments of depression and anxiety-related behaviors. However, the exact contribution of this receptor to normal brain physiology and disease processes remains poorly understood, due to a complex expression pattern and multiple functions. Recent development in genetic and genomic approaches allows not only for more refined functional dissection, but also for probing large gene databases for unknown gene product interactions. Here, we describe an experimental approach that is based on a combination of regional and temporal genetic manipulations of the 5-HT1A receptor with large-scale gene expression profiling to attempt to untangle the distinct roles for this receptor in particular brain regions, as well as to identify molecular partners that mediate its function. In turn, new leads for understanding mechanisms of anxiety, depression and their pharmacological treatments may be generated.
