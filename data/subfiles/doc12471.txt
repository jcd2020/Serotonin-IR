Tanaka, K., et al. (2015). "Modulation of osteoblast differentiation and bone mass by 5-HT2A receptor signaling in mice." Eur J Pharmacol 762: 150-157.

	Recent studies reported that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) may be an endogenous paracrine and/or autocrine factor that is used for intercellular communication in bone cells and between multiple organs regulating bone homeostasis. In the present study, we showed that the administration of MDL11939, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, reduced bone mass in mice. The loss of bone mass in MDL11939-treated mice was associated with impaired bone formation in vivo, as demonstrated by the lower expression of osterix (Osx) and osteocalcin than that in vehicle-treated mice. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in osteoclast numbers between MDL11939- and vehicle-treated mice. The pharmacological blockade of 5-HT2A receptor signaling significantly decreased alkaline phosphatase activity in osteoblastic cells. In addition, the knockdown of the 5-HT2A receptor by a siRNA treatment decreased Osx, but not Runx2 gene expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. These results suggest that 5-HT2A receptor signaling mediated bone mass by regulating osteoblast differentiation.
