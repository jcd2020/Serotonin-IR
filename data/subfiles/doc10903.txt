Tan, P. Z., et al. (1999). "Rapid synthesis of F-18 and H-2 dual-labeled altanserin, a metabolically resistant PET ligand for 5-HT2A receptors." Journal of Labelled Compounds & Radiopharmaceuticals 42(5): 457-467.

	F-18 and H-2 dual-labeled altanserin (3, [F-18]d-ALT), a novel PET tracer for 5-HT2A receptors with metabolically resistant properties, was synthesized by [F-18]fluoride displacement of the corresponding deuterated nitro precursor in 32% yield (EOB) in 108 min with radiochemical purity 95% and specific activity >1000 mCi/mu mol (EOS). The key intermediate ethyl N-(2-chloroethyl-2,2-d(2))carbamate (7 was obtained by LiAlD4 reduction of a glycine ester (93%), chlorination and carbamoylation (79%). 4-(4-Nitrobenzoyl)piperidine (13) was synthesized (60%) by improving the published coupling reaction of p-nitrophenyltrimethylstannane (10), obtained from p-iodonitrobenzene and (CH3)(6)Sn-2 (94%), with 1-benzoylisonipecotic acid chloride (11) followed by acid hydrolysis. 13 was alkylated with 7 (82%), hydrolyzed and condensed with methyl o-isothiocyanatobenzoyate to provide with the precursor deuteronitmaltanserin (4, 75%).
