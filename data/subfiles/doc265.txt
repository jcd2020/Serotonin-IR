	A feature of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders is motor impulsivity. Recent studies have implicated serotonin (5-HT) systems in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in mediating individual differences in motor impulsivity, notably the 5-HT2AR receptor (5-HT2AR) and 5-HT2cR. We investigated the hypothesis that differences in the ratio of 5HT(2A)R:5-HT2cR protein expression in mPFC would predict the individual level of motor impulsivity and that the engineered loss of the 5-HT2cR would result in high motor impulsivity concomitant with elevated 5-HT2AR expression and pharmacological sensitivity to the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist M100907. High and low impulsive rats were identified in a 1-choice serial reaction time task. Native protein levels of the 5-HT2AR and the 5-HT2cR predicted the intensity of motor impulsivity and the 5-HT2AR:5-HT2cR ratio in mPFC positively correlated with levels of premature responses in individual outbred rats. The possibility that the 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2cR act in concert to control motor impulsivity is supported by the observation that high phenotypic motor impulsivity associated with a diminished mPFC synaptosomal 5-HT2AR:5-HT2cR protein:protein interaction. Knockdown of mPFC 5-HT2cR resulted in increased motor impulsivity and triggered a functional disruption of the local S-HT2AR:5-HT2cR balance as evidenced by a compensatory upregulation of 5-HT2AR protein expression and a leftward shift in the potency of MI00907 to suppress impulsive behavior. We infer that there is an interactive relationship between the mPFC 5-HT2AR and 5-HT2cR, and that a 5-HT2AR:5HT(2c)R imbalance may be a functionally relevant mechanism underlying motor impulsivity.
