Kidd, E. J., et al. (1990). "Chronic 5-HT2 receptor antagonist treatment alters 5-HT1A autoregulatory control of 5-HT release in rat brain in vivo." J Neurosci Methods 34(1-3): 91-98.

	Rats treated chronically (14 days) with the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin, show decreased 5-HT2 receptor numbers in the frontal cortex. The present experiments were designed to investigate the effects of acute and chronic ritanserin treatment on the autoregulatory control of the release of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-HIAA in vivo in rats using intracerebral dialysis. Neither acute nor chronic ritanserin treatment altered basal extracellular levels of 5-HT or 5-HIAA, suggesting that 5-HT2 receptors do not directly influence 5-HT release. In the control animals, systemic stimulation of somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT, inhibited the release of 5-HT presumably via inhibitory feedback autoregulation; an effect also seen in animals treated acutely with ritanserin. However, in the animals treated chronically with ritanserin, administration of 8-OH-DPAT produced an initial increase in extracellular 5-HT which declined gradually to the end of the experiment. These results suggest that chronic, but not acute, 5-HT2 receptor antagonist treatment attenuates the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated autoregulation of 5-HT release. The underlying mechanisms have yet to be ascertained.
