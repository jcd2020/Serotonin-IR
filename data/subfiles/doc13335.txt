	Neurotransmitter receptors are often colocalized in a neuron with other receptors, and activation of one receptor can either amplify or antagonize the response to a colocalized receptor. The aim of this study was to investigate the cross-regulation of synaptic transmission by beta-adrenergic and serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptors and to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Stimulation of presynaptic beta-adrenergic receptors with isoproterenol (Iso) in the basolateral amygdala resulted in a long-lasting increase in synaptic transmission. This effect was mimicked by forskolin, an activator for adenylyl cyclase and a cAMP analog. In addition, the effect of forskolin was blocked by catalytic and regulatory site antagonists for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), indicating a PKA-mediated mechanism. Application of 5-HT depressed the synaptic transmission and blocked Iso- and forskolin-induced potentiation. The effect of 5-HT was mimicked by the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and was blocked by the selective 5-HT1A antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine, indicating its mediation by 5-HT1A receptors. To determine the locus of interaction, Sp-cAMPS, a membrane-permeable activator of PKA, was applied, and the potentiation produced by Sp-cAMPS was completely blocked in slices pretreated with 5-HT. These results suggest that the interaction between the intracellular signaling pathways activated by 5-HT1A and beta-adrenergic receptors occurs at a step downstream from cAMP production.
