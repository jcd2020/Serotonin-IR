	Short-term adrenalectomy induces a loss of mature granular neuronal phenotypes in the hippocampal dentate gyrus; injection of 5-HT1A receptor agonist reverses this effect. Adrenalectomy also induces an increase of expression of 5-HT1A receptor mRNA in the dentate gyrus. This study tested the effect of 5-HT1A agonist on this adrenalectomy-induced increase of 5-HT1A mRNA. Five, 9 and 18 days after adrenalectomy, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA is increased in the granular layer of the dentate gyrus. The increase is nearly 100% at day 18 after adrenalectomy. 5-HT1A agonist treatment decreased 5-HT1A mRNA both at 9 (20%) and 18 days (34%) after adrenalectomy. Our results indicated that a 5-HT1A agonist can partly reverse the adrenalectomy-induced increase of 5-HT1A mRNA and loss of mature granular neuronal phenotypes in hippocampal dentate gyrus.
