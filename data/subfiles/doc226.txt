	Exposure to a novel environment is a stressor which modulates behavior, increases stress hormones and enhances the release of several neurotransmitters; including serotonin (5-HT). Exposing rabbits to a novel environment significantly increases head-bob behavior but fails to alter either grooming or wet dog shakes compared with those observed in the home-cage. The goal of this study was to determine the role of 5-HT and its receptors in mediating novelty-elicited head-bob behavior. Reduction of central 5-HT levels after treatment with the serotonergic neurotoxin 5,7-DHT significantly decreased novelty-elicited head bobs by 40% compared with those in sham-lesioned rabbits, indicating that 5-HT mediates, in part, this behavior. Additionally, pretreatment with the 5-HT1A partial agonist and clinically used anxiolytic buspirone also significantly attenuated novelty-elicited head bobs. Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT2A antagonist M 100,907 significantly reduced novel environment-elicited head bobs by 40%. Furthermore, agonist-induced reduction of cortical 5-HT2A receptor density resulted in a significant 40% reduction in the number of head bobs elicited by the novel environment. These data demonstrate that rabbit head-bob behavior, an index of the response to novelty stress, is mediated, in part, by 5-HT activation of 5-HT2A receptors.
