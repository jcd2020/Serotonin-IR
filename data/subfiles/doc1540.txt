Cambj-Sapunar, L., et al. (2003). "Contribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) receptors and 20-hydroxyeiscosatetraenoic acid to fall in cerebral blood flow after subarachnoid hemorrhage." Stroke 34(5): 1269-1275.

	Background and Purpose-This study examined the interaction between 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) (5-HT1B)receptors and 20-hydroxyeiscosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) in contributing to the acute fall in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in rats. Methods-The effects of intracisternal injection of 0.3 mL of arterial blood, artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and 5-HT on rCBF and the levels of 20-HETE and 5-HT in cerebrospinal fluid were measured in rats pretreated with vehicle, a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (isamoltane hemifumarate), or an inhibitor of the synthesis of 20-HETE (HET0016). The effects of HET0016 and isamoltane on the vasoconstrictor response and changes in [Ca2+](i) to 5-HT were also studied in middle cerebral arteries and vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from these vessels. Results-20-HETE and 5-HT levels in cerebrospinal fluid rose from 172+/-10 to 629+/-44 ng/mL and from 6+/-4 to 1163+/-200 nmol/mL, respectively, after SAH. rCBF fell by 30% 10 minutes after SAH, and it remained at this level for the next 2 hours. Blockade of 5-HT1B receptors prevented the sustained fall in rCBF seen after SAH. Intracisternal injection of 5-HT mimicked SAH by increasing 20-HETE levels in cerebrospinal fluid to 475+/-94 ng/mL and reducing rCBF by 30%. Blockade of the synthesis of 20-HETE with HET0016 prevented the fall in rCBF produced by 5-HT. Isamoltane and HET0016 reduced the vasoconstrictor response of isolated MCA to 5-HT by >60% and diminished the rise in [Ca2+](i) produced by 5-HT in vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from these arteries. Conclusions-These results suggest that the release of 5-HT after SAH activates 5-HT1B receptors and the synthesis of 20-HETE and that 20-HETE contributes to the acute fall in rCBF by potentiating the vasoconstrictor response of cerebral vessels to 5-HT.
