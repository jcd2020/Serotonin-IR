	Desensitization of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B autoreceptors is thought to be the mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors when these are administered chronically. The blockade of 5-HT1A autoreceptors occurring on administration of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor together with a 5-HT1A autoreceptor antagonist is responsible for the acute increase in 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin, 5-HT) levels observed under these circumstances. The effects of repeated administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors together with 5-HT1A receptor antagonists have not been widely studied. in this work, we found that the effects of fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, i.p., daily for 12 days) to desensitize 5-HT1B autoreceptors in the frontal cortex, as measured by the effect of the locally administered 5-HT1B receptor agonist, 3-(1,2,5,6- tetrahydropyrid-4-yl)pyrrolo [3,2-b]pyrid-5-one (CP 93129), and to desensitize 5HT(1A) autoreceptors as measured by the action of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 50 mug/kg, s.c.) to reduce 5-HT levels in cortex, were prevented by concomitant administration of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635; 0.3 mg/kg, s.c.). 5-HT1B receptor activity in the hypothalamus, as measured by the effects of locally administered CP 93129, and 5-14T(1A) autoreceptor activity, as determined by the effects of subcutaneous 8-OH-DPAT to reduce 5-HT levels in hypothalamus, were not altered either by fluoxetine alone or by fluoxetine in the presence of WAY-100635. The data suggest that the regulation of extracellular levels of 5-HT in the cortex and hypothalamus is subject to different autoregulatory mechanisms. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
