	The present study investigated the involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptors in Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced catalepsy-like immobilization in mice. THC (10 mg/kg, i.p.) induced catalepsy-like immobilization but had no effect on motor coordination in the rota-rod test. The selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant (3 mg/kg, i.p.) completely antagonized THC-induced catalepsy-like immobilization. The 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist buspirone (0.06 and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited this THC-induced catalepsy-like immobilization. Moreover, the selective 5HT(1A) receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohezane carboxamide dihydrochloride (WAY100635; 0.3 or 1 mg/kg, i.p.) reversed the inhibition of THC-induced catalepsy-like immobilization by 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) or buspirone (0.06 mg/kg). In contrast, the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist (R)-3-[2-[2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)ethyl]pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl] phenol hydrochloride (SB269970) had no effect on this inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT. On the other hand, WAY100635 (0.3 and 1 mg/kg, i.p.) enhanced the catalepsy-like immobilization induced by THC (6 mg/kg, i.p.). These findings suggest that the 5-HT1A receptors are involved in THC-induced catalepsy-like immobilization. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
