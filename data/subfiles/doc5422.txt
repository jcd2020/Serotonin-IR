	In order to determine the state of dopamine (DA) derived from exogenously administered L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in the striatum of Parkinson's disease, we have applied an in vivo brain microdialysis method to rats with dopaminergic denervation with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), the rat model of Parkinson's disease, and measured extracellular DA levels in the striatum after L-DOPA administration. We obtained the following results: (1) Inhibitory effect of the potent D-2 agonist quinpirole on L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA was not detected in the denervated striatum; (2) reserpine pretreatment greatly reduced L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA; (3) additional serotonergic denervation to rats with dopaminergic denervation induced a significant reduction in L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA; and (4) activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HT)(1A) receptors attenuated an increase in L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA. These results suggest that the conversion of exogenous L-DOPA to DA and the storage and release of converted DA occur in serotonergic nerve terminals when dopaminergic neurons are denervated. It is possible that serotonergic neurons play a critical role in the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
