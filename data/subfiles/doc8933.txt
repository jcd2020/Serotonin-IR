Poland, R. E., et al. (1995). "PRENATAL STRESS PREVENTS THE DESENSITIZATION OF THE CORTICOSTERONE RESPONSE TO TFMPP BY DESMETHYLIMIPRAMINE, BUT NOT BY PHENELZINE, IN ADULT MALE OFFSPRING." Life Sciences 57(23): 2163-2170.

	Gravid female rats were subjected to one hour of restraint stress twice daily or left undisturbed from days 14-21 of gestation. Adult 105-day old male non-stressed (NS) and stressed (S) offspring were treated once daily with saline, desipramine (DMI) (10 mg/kg, sc) or phenelzine (5.0 mg/kg, sc) for 14 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, animals were challenged with saline or 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) (5.0 mg/kg, sc), a serotonin(1B/2C) (5-HT1B/2C) agonist, and plasma prolactin and corticosterone concentrations were measured one hour later. As compared to acute saline administration, TFMPP significantly increased prolactin and corticosterone concentrations in all groups. In NS offspring, both DMI and phenelzine treatment augmented the prolactin response, but blunted the corticosterone response, to TFMPP. In S offspring, the prolactin response to TFMPP also was augmented by phenelzine or DMI treatment, whereas the corticosterone response to TFMPP was blunted during phenelzine treatment. However, DMI treatment was not able to desensitize the corticosterone response to TFMPP in the S rats. The results indicate the adaptive capacity of 5-HT systems to DMI administration was compromised in adult animals exposed to stress in utero.
