	GR67330 potently inhibited 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced depolarizations of the rat isolated vagus nerve. At the higher concentrations used (0.3 nmol/l-1 nmol/l) this was accompanied by a marked reduction in the maximum response to 5-HT. The calculated pKB value was 10.2. The binding of the tritiated derivative of GR67330 to homogenates of rat entorhinal cortex was examined. Kinetic analysis revealed that specific [3H] GR67330 (0.1 nmol/l) binding was rapid and reversible. Association and dissociation rate constants were 1.48 +/- 0.36 x 10(8) mol/l-1 s-1 and 7.85 +/- 0.41 x 10(-3) s-1 respectively. Equilibrium saturation analysis revealed specific binding was to a single site (Bmax 22.6 +/- 0.21 fmol/mg protein) of high affinity (Kd 0.038 +/- 0.003 nmol/l). At low ligand concentrations, specific binding was up to 90% of total binding. If unlabelled GR67330 was used to define non-specific binding two sites were evident (Kd1 0.066 +/- 0.007 nmol/l, Kd2 20.1 +/- 9.7 nmol/l; Bmax1 31.5 +/- 3.2 fmol/mg protein, Bmax2 1110 +/- 420 fmol/mg protein). [3H] GR67330 binding was inhibited potently by 5-HT3 antagonists and agonists. Ligands for other 5-HT receptors and other neurotransmitter receptors were either only weakly active or inactive at inhibiting binding. Hill numbers for antagonist inhibition of binding were close to unity, except for quipazine which was significantly greater than one. In common with other 5-HT3 binding studies, all 5-H-agonist tested had Hill numbers greater than one (1.51-1.71). GR38032 and GR65630 inhibited a greater proportion of binding than other 5-HT3 antagonists, this additional binding was interpreted as inhibition from a second saturable site unrelated to the 5-HT3 receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
