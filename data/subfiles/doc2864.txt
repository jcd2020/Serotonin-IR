	Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) are designed to treat adults, but are increasingly prescribed for adolescents. SSRIs might cause permanent changes in serotonin-related behavior in adolescents, since their serotonergic system is stilt developing. Mate Wistar rats were treated with paroxetine (15 mg/kg p.o.) or fluvoxamine (30 mg/kg p.o.) throughout adolescence. After a washout period their behavior in the elevated plus-maze, prepulse inhibition test, Forced swimming test and elevated T-maze were studied. In addition, the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT on sexual behavior and tower lip retraction were measured. Paroxetine mildly inhibited weight gain during treatment. Both SSRIs caused a reduction in ejaculation frequency and in time spent on the open arm of the elevated plus-maze in adult rats. Fluvoxamine slightly increased avoidance latency in the elevated T-maze compared to paroxetine. No differences between the groups were found in the other tests. Apparently, chronic treatment with SSRIs during adolescence may cause mild changes in adult behavior. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.
