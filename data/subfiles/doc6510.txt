Liu, I. S., et al. (1998). "A serotonin-4 receptor-like pseudogene in humans." Brain Res Mol Brain Res 53(1-2): 98-103.

	During a search for new G-protein-linked receptors for dopamine and serotonin, we found a serotonin-4 receptor-like pseudogene. This receptor-like pseudogene is intronless, contains an in-frame stop codon following transmembrane-3, and has two one-nucleotide insertions between transmembrane-5 and -6 regions which alter the reading frame. The predicted amino acid sequence of the human pseudogene is about 35% identical with that of the rat serotonin-4 receptor.
