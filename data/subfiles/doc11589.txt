	The effects of chlorpromazine and the lidocaine derivative QX222, which block nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, were examined on 5-HT3 receptors in N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma cells, using whole cell voltage-clamp and radioligand binding. Electrophysiological studies examining the effects of chlorpromazine and QX222 on 5-HT3 agonist-induced responses revealed IC50s of 0.2 and 8.5 microM respectively. The action was not voltage- or use-dependent and there was no blocking action when chlorpromazine was applied from inside the cell. Chlorpromazine and QX222 inhibited the binding of a radiolabelled 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, [3H]GR65630, with IC50s of 0.9 and 29 microM respectively. Scatchard plots revealed a decrease in affinity (Kd) in the presence of chlorpromazine, but no change in the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax). The results suggest differential actions of the compounds at 5-HT3 and acetylcholine receptors.
