	Midbrain raphe nuclei provide strong serotonergic projections to the hippocampus, in which serotonin (5-HT) exerts differential effects mediated by multiple 5-HT receptor subtypes. The functional relevance of this diversity of information processing is poorly understood. Here we show that serotonin via 5-HT(1B) heteroreceptors substantially reduces synaptic excitation of cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons in area CA1 of the rat hippocampus, in contrast to parvalbumin-expressing basket cells. The reduction is input specific, affecting only glutamatergic synaptic transmission originating from CA1 pyramidal cells. As a result, serotonin selectively decreases feedback inhibition via 5-HT(1B) receptor activation and subsequently increases the integration time window for spike generation in CA1 pyramidal cells. Our data imply an important role for serotonergic modulation of GABAergic action in subcortical control of hippocampal output.
