	Recent evidences show that activation of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2A R) by agonists is significant in improving therapeutic activity of disease conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Though the exact molecular mechanism is still not well understood, it is thought to involve agonist-driven, enhanced expression of 5-HT2A R in certain areas of brain, such as the pre-frontal cortex (PFC). Several other reports have also demonstrated association of OCD with lower dopamine receptor (D2 R) availability, primarily in the striatum of the brain along with dysfunction of 5-HT2A R-D2 R heteromer regulation. We thus hypothesized that compound(s) interacting with this molecular mechanism could be developed as drugs for long-term beneficial effects against OCD. In the present study, we have obtained experimental evidence in cultured neuronal cells (CLU213) that aqueous extract (AE, 50 mug/mL, P < 0.05) of the Australian cane toad skin significantly increased the levels of 5-HT2A R and D2 R protein and mRNA expression. AE was also found to enhance the interaction between 5-HT2A R and D2 R and formation of expression of 5-HT2A R-D2 R heteromer using co-immunoprecipitation and Western blot. Further investigation showed the involvement of classical signaling pathway (Gq/11 -PLCbeta) along with c-FOS transcription factor preferentially in 5-HT2A -mediated agonist activation. These results obtained demonstrated that AE upregulates 5-HT2A R by a mechanism that appears to involve Gq/11 -PLCbeta signaling pathway and c-FOS transcription factor activation. We indicate this enhanced 5-HT2A R and D2 R expression and their interaction to induce increased 5-HT2A R-D2 R heteromer formation by exposure to AE might provide a molecular mechanism to develop potential novel drug candidates to ameliorate OCD symptoms.
