	Schizophrenics commonly demonstrate abnormalities in central filtering capability following repetitive sensory stimuli. Such sensory inhibition deficits can be mirrored in rodents following administration of psycho-stimulatory drugs. In the present study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with brain surface electrodes to record auditory evoked EEG potentials in a paired-stimulus paradigm, using 87 dB clicks delivered 0.5s apart. Amphetamine (1.83mg/kg, i.p.) produced the expected loss of sensory inhibition, as defined by an increase in the ratio between test (T) and conditioning (C) amplitudes at N40, a mid-latency peak of the evoked potentials. Also, the 5-HT1A agonist (R)-8-OH-DPAT caused a significant increase in the TC ratio at the highest dose studied (0.5 mg/kg s.c.), while the 5-HT1A antagonist (S)-UH-301 did not significantly affect the TC ratio at any dose studied (0.1 - 5mg/kg s. c.). When administered with amphetamine, a lower dose of 8-OH-DPAT (0.1mg/kg) and the highest dose of UH-301 tested (5mg/kg, s. c.) were able to reverse the amphetamineinduced increase in TC ratio. The findings suggest that 5-HT1A signaling is involved in sensory inhibition and support the evaluation of 5-HT1A receptor active compounds in conditions with central filtering deficits, such as schizophrenia.
