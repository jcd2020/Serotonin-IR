Ito, H., et al. (1998). "PET imaging of central 5-HT2A receptors with carbon-11-MDL 100,907." Journal of Nuclear Medicine 39(1): 208-214.

	Serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors are of central interest in the complex pathophysiology of schizophrenia, These receptors have also been proposed as putative targets for atypical antipsychotic drugs. Suitable radioligands for 5-HT2A receptors are required to evaluate this hypothesis in vivo with PET, MDL 100,907 is a highly selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist that is currently being developed as a potential antipsychotic drug. We have previously reported on the preparation of [C-11]MDL 100,907 and initial characterization of [C-11]MDL 100,907 binding in the monkey brain, In this preliminary PET study, the regional distribution and binding kinetics of [C-11]MDL 100,907 were examined in healthy men. Methods: A PET examination was performed in each of three subjects after intravenous injection of [C-11]MDL 100,907. The metabolite-corrected arterial input function was used in a kinetic analysis according to the standard three-compartment model. Results: The highest radioactivity concentration was observed in the neocortex, whereas radioactivity was lower in the cerebellum, pens, thalamus, striatum and white matter, The binding potential (BP) in the neocortical regions was 4-6 times higher, whereas BP in the striatum was slightly higher than that in the cerebellum, demonstrating a regional distribution in good agreement with 5-HT2A receptor densities measured in vitro, The BP in the cerebellum was small but not negligible. Conclusion: This preliminary study suggests that [C-11]MDL 100,907 is a suitable PET radioligand for studies on 5-HT2A receptors in man, The high selectivity of MDL 100,907 represents a major advantage as compared to presently available radioligands with poor selectivity, Thus, [C-11]MDL 100,907 is recommended in the future for PET studies in healthy subjects and schizophrenic patients, including the determination of drug-induced 5-HT2A receptor occupancy.
