	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiologic roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are five receptor subtypes within the G protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E and 5-HT1F. 5-HT1A receptors are abundantly present in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, frontal cortex, raphe nucleus and septum with the lowest densities are observed in the basal ganglia, substantia nigra and cerebellum (5). Some thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei have intermediate densities. 5-HT1A receptors are involved in the mediation of emotion and the function of the hypothalamus. 5-HT1A receptors are implicated in anxiety, depression, hallucinogenic behavior, motion sickness and eating disorders. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacologic role of 5-HT1A receptors. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT1A radioligands [PubMed], such as [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY 100635, [(18)F]FPWAY and [(18)F]MPPF, for positron emission tomography imaging. However, some of these compounds lack good resistance to in vivo metabolism (6) or exhibit substantial cleavage of the (18)F-fluorine bond (7), causing difficulties in using the reference region method for determination of brain 5-HT1A receptor densities . N-{2-[4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(4-fluoromethylcycloh exane)carboxamide (MeFWAY), a fluoromethyl derivative to the cyclohexyl-ring of WAY-100635, was reported to be a potent inhibitor of 5-HT1A receptors and to provide more resistance towards defluorination and metabolism in vivo. This led to the development of N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(4-[(18)F]-fluorometh ylcyclohexane)carboxamide ([(18)F]MeFWAY) as a useful tool for 5-HT1A receptor positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in vivo (8).
