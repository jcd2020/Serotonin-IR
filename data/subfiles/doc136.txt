	Effects of lisuride, a derivative of ergot alkaloid, on central 5-HT1A receptors were investigated biochemically, behaviorally and electroencephalographically (EEG) in rats and rabbits. Effects of lisuride in water-lick conflict tests were also investigated in rats. Lisuride was found to strongly inhibit the bindings of [3H]8-OH-DPAT to 5-HT1A receptors in the raphe nucleus, hippocampus, cortex, amygdala and hypothalamus of rat brain. Inhibitory effects of lisuride on bindings of [3H]8-OH-DPAT in the hippocampus was almost the same as that of 5-HT (Ki = 0.5 nM) and stronger than those of the 5-HT agonist 5-MeO-DMT (Ki = 2.1 nM) or other ergot derivatives (bromocriptine and pergolide, Ki = 3.0 nM). Lisuride (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, i.p.), like 8-OH-DPAT, dose-dependently induced a 5-HT behavioral syndrome in rats. Lisuride affected locomotor activity in rats, whereas 8-OH-DPAT did not. In hippocampal EEG of rabbits, lisuride (0.01-0.03 mg/kg, i.v.), like 8-OH-DPAT and diazepam, dose-dependently inhibited rhythmical slow activity (RSA) induced by acoustical stimulation (3100 Hz) and also inhibited the RSA increased by administration of anxiogenic FG7142. In water-lick conflict tests, lisuride (0.05-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), like diazepam, increased the number of shocks. These findings indicated that lisuride acts as a strong agonist on central 5-HT1A receptors and suggested that lisuride might be a potential anxiolytic.
