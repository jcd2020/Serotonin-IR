Miller, A. D. and S. Nonaka (1992). "MECHANISMS OF VOMITING INDUCED BY SEROTONIN-3 RECEPTOR AGONISTS IN THE CAT - EFFECT OF VAGOTOMY, SPLANCHNICECTOMY OR AREA POSTREMA LESION." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 260(2): 509-517.

	The locations of serotonin-3 (5-HT3) receptors involved in initiating vomiting (emesis) were assessed by cutting visceral afferents or lesioning the area postrema. The 5-HT3 receptor agonists phenylbiguanide (PBG) and 2-methyl-5-HT were shown to induce vomiting and related prodromal signs (e.g., licking, swallowing) in nonoperated cats. Two-methyl-5-HT, but not PBG, also usually produced defecation and sometimes urination. Most studies were conducted using PBG, which induced vomiting in 40/49 (82%) cats at doses of 8.0 mg/kg i.p. or less (thresholds ranged from 2-8 mg/kg, median 5 mg/kg). Latencies to the first episode ranged from 4 to 21 min (median 7.5 min). PBG-induced vomiting was blocked by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist MDL 72222. Lesions of the area postrema had no apparent effect on vomiting induced by PBG or by electrical stimulation of abdominal vagal afferents. In contrast, the threshold of PBG-induced vomiting was increased by supradiaphragmatic vagotomy and greatly increased by splanchnic nerve section. Thus, abdominal visceral afferents, but not the area postrema, play an important role in mediating vomiting induced by i.p. injection of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist PBG. The mechanisms by which vomiting is induced by PBG as compared to the cancer chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin are discussed.
