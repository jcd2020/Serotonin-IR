	The effects of the electrically evoked serotonin release were evaluated on the binding of F-18-MPPF in the hippocampus of anesthetized rats. The specific binding of F-18-MPPF was measured by an implanted beta-microprobe and the serotonin (5-HT) extracellular concentration was measured by microdialysis under the same conditions. Our results showed that the 10-, 20-, or 30-min electrical stimulation of the raphe nucleus elicited a significant increase in extracellular 5-HT, only detectable in the presence of a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor in the perfusate (5 muM clomipramine). Interestingly, the raphe stimulations were associated with a 27-76% reversible decrease of the F-18-MPPF specific binding in the hippocampus, but an unchanged extracellular F-18-MPPF collected in dialysates. Considered together, these observations suggest that F-18-MPPF binding is sensitive to 5-HT released at a neuronal level. This compartment, explored by the beta-microprobe, is probably distinct from the extracellular compartment, explored by microdialysis. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
