	Serotonin (5-HT) is a major neurotransmitter in mammalian brains and is involved in brain development and psychiatric disorders. The 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) associated with an inhibitory G-protein (G(i)) with the widest and most abundant expression. It is not known; however, how expression or activity of 5-HT(lA)R is regulated. We studied here phosphorylation of 5-HT(1A)R by cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a neuron-specific membrane-bound Ser/Thr kinase that is activated by binding of the p35 Cdk5 activator. 5-HT(1A)R was phosphorylated by the Cdk5-p35 complex at Thr314 in the third cytoplasmic loop. The phosphorylation stimulated the degradation of 5-HT(1A)R by the proteasome, resulting in neutralization of the inhibitory action of 5-HT(1A)R on intracellular cAMP concentration. These results suggest that Cdk5-p35 modulates 5-HT signaling through phosphorylation-dependent degradation of 5-HT(lA)R.
