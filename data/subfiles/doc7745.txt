Moroi, K., et al. (1998). "Characterization of [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine and [3H]spiperone binding sites in clathrin-coated vesicles from bovine brain." Brain Res 794(2): 291-298.

	Coated vesicles prepared from bovine brain cerebral cortex exhibited [3H]5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) and [3H]spiperone binding activities. The binding activities were localized in the inner core vesicles. Binding reached an equilibrium level by 30-45 min at 30 degreesC, and was reversed by the addition of 100 microM 5-HT for [3H]5-HT binding or 10 microM ketanserin for [3H]spiperone binding. The saturation binding experiments indicated a single class of binding sites for [3H]5-HT and [3H]spiperone with apparent Kd values of 2.4 and 1.75 nM, respectively. The binding of [3H]5-HT was displaced by 5-HT and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), but not by ketanserin. The binding of [3H]spiperone was displaced by spiperone and ketanserin but not by 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT even at 1 mM. The coated vesicles were shown by immunoblotting assay to contain alpha-subunits of GTP-binding proteins, Galphas, Galphai2, Galphai3, Galphao and Galphaq/11. Forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the coated vesicles was inhibited to 80% of the control level by 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT. These results suggested that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors are present in bovine brain coated vesicles and that the 5-HT1A receptors are coupled to adenylate cyclase activity via GTP binding proteins.
