	To gain further insight into the operation of 5-HT autoreceptor-mediated feedback control of 5-HT biosynthesis in serotonergic nerve terminal areas, the effect of the 5-HT1B and the 5-HT1A receptor agonists, TFMPP and 8-OH-DPAT, respectively, were investigated in the rat central nervous system (CNS) using in vivo and in vitro neurochemical approaches. TFMPP suppressed 5-HT synthesis (5-HTP accumulation after decarboxylase inhibition) both in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the 5-HT synthesis-suppressing effect of the drug (3.0 mg/kg, s.c.) proved resistant to either acute hemitransection or reserpine (5 mg/kg, i.p.; 90 min before) pretreatment. In vitro, in cortical, hippocampal and striatal slice preparations, TFMPP (0.1-10 mu M) decreased 5-HT synthesis under basal and stimulated (30 mM K+) conditions, an effect which was unaltered by prior in vivo reserpine-induced 5-HT depletion but was attenuated in the presence of 5-HT1B receptor antagonists such as methiothepin, cyanopindolol or propranolol. The 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.)-induced decrease of 5-HT synthesis in vivo was abolished by hemitransection but resistant to acute reserpine pretreatment; 8-OH-DPAT (10 mu M) did not decrease 5-HT synthesis in vitro. In conclusion, the present study confirms the importance of 5-HT autoreceptors in the feedback control of nerve terminal 5-HT biosynthesis. Specifically, our data indicate: (1) that the reduction of rat brain 5-HT synthesis after TFMPP is mediated by 5-HT1B autoreceptors located on the serotonergic axon terminals, and (2) that the effect is directly mediated and occurs independently of 5-HT neuronal firing and intact monoamine stores.
