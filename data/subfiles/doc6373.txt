	Background Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorder characterized by abdominal pain and abnormal bowel habits, both of which are exacerbated by psychological stress. The translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) is a marker of reactive gliosis in a number of central nervous system (CNS) diseases and responsible for many cellular functions, including neurosteroidogenesis. Although it has been reported that psychological stress disturbs neurosteroids levels, the pathophysiological relevance of TSPO in IBS is poorly understood. MethodsKey ResultsWe examined the effects of a TSPO antagonist, ONO-2952, on stress-induced stool abnormality and abdominal pain in rats, and on anxiety-related behavior induced by cholecystokinin. Oral administration of ONO-2952 attenuated stress-induced defecation and rectal hyperalgesia in rats with an efficacy equivalent to that of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. In addition, ONO-2952 suppressed cholecystokinin-induced anxiety-like behavior with an efficacy equivalent to that of psychotropic drugs. On the other hand, ONO-2952 did not affect spontaneous defecation, gastrointestinal transit, visceral nociceptive threshold, and neurosteroid production in non-stressed rats even at a dose 10 times higher than its effective dose in the stress models. Conclusions and InferencesThese results suggest that TSPO antagonism results in antistress action, and that ONO-2952 is a promising candidate for IBS without side effects associated with current treatment.
