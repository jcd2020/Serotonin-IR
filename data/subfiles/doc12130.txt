Yonehara, N. (2001). "Influence of serotonin receptor antagonists on substance P and serotonin release evoked by tooth pulp stimulation with electro-acupuncture in the trigeminal nucleus cudalis of the rabbit." Neurosci Res 40(1): 45-51.

	We studied the effect of NAN-190 (5-HT(1A) antagonist), ketanserin (5-HT(2) antagonist) and ICS 205-930 (5-HT(3) antagonist) on tooth pulp stimulation (TPS)-induced 5-HT release and substance P (SP) release in the superficial layers of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (SpVc-I,II) in the presence or absence of electro-acupuncture (EAP). TPS slightly increased 5-HT release and significantly increased SP release. In combination with EAP, TPS-induced 5-HT release was remarkably enhanced, whereas SP release was significantly suppressed. Pretreatment with NAN-190 (3.5 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly enhanced the increase in TPS-induced 5-HT release in the presence of EAP. On the other hand, the increase of 5-HT release induced following TPS in the presence of EAP was inhibited by pretreatment with ketanserin (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) and ICS 205-930 (1 mg/kg, i.v.). When NAN-190 was pre-treated in the animals combined TPS and EAP, the amount of SP release was significantly reduced compared with the absence of this drug. On the other hand, pretreatment with ketanserin and ICS 205-930 reversed the inhibitory effect of EAP on the TPS-generated SP release, especially ICS 205-930, which remarkably enhanced TPS-induced SP release compared with the absence of this drug. On the basis of the obtained results, we concluded that NAN-190 and ICS 205-930 act on EAP-induced analgesia positively and suppressively, respectively, by regulation of TPS-generated SP release through activation of their subtype receptors. On the other hand, ketanserin does not affect TPS-induced 5-HT release and SP release in the presence of EAP.
