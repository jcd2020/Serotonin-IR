Ponomarenko, A. A., et al. (2003). "Aminergic control of high-frequency (approximately 200 Hz) network oscillations in the hippocampus of the behaving rat." Neurosci Lett 348(2): 101-104.

	Hippocampal high-frequency (200 Hz, 'ripple') oscillations were recorded in the CA1 area of behaving rats. The histamine H1-receptor antagonist pyrilamine facilitated while the H2-antagonist zolantidine (5 mg/kg i.p) transiently decreased ripple occurrence. Thioperamide, an H3 antagonist, had no effect. The 5-HT1A-receptor antagonist WAY100635 (50 microg i.c.v.) reduced the occurrence and the intrinsic frequency of ripples. The 5-HT3-receptor antagonist Y-25130 (i.c.v.) increased the number but reduced the amplitude of ripples. All the treatments affected sharp-waves and ripple oscillations to the same extent. Changes of ripple occurrence were not secondary to alterations of behavior. In the light of these divergent actions via different receptor subtypes the net effect of aminergic innervations will be determined by their state-dependent activities and mutual interactions as well as receptor localizations.
