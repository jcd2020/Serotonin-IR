	Depression is prospectively associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease in individuals initialty free of clinical cardiovascular disease probably by an increased platelet activity. The serotonergic receptors mainly implied in depression are 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. Activation of 5HT(2) receptor induces platelet aggregation. Drugs with 5-HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist effects reduced the receptor-mediated platelet aggregation. There are only indirect data about 5-HT1A receptors presence in platelet membranes, thus our aims were to study the characteristics of the platelet membranes 5-HT1A binding sites of both healthy volunteers and patients with cardiac valve disease and ischemic cardiopathy. The bound of the 5-HT1A selective agonist H-3-80H-DPAT to the platelet membranes 5-HT1A binding sites of patients with cardiac valve disease and ischemic cardiopathy were compared with a control group of healthy voluntaries using radioligand binding methods. The patients with cardiovascular disease showed a reduction (-50.401%) (p < 0.01) of the H-3-80H-DPAT bound to the platelet membranes 5-HT1A receptors (1.652 +/- 0.79 fmol/mg protein) with respect to the control group (3.331 +/- 0.16 fmol/mg protein). H-3-80H-DPAT binding to human platelet membranes is saturable, of high affinity, and seems selective for 5-HT1A receptors, and similar to that described in animal brain and in other human cells. Patients with ischemic cardiopathy and cardiac valve disease showed a reduction of the 80H-DPAT bound to the platelet membranes. Taken together, these findings suggest that the 80H-DPAT bound to the human platelet membranes is modulated by modifications produced by cardiovascular disease conditions. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
