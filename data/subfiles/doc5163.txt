	Serotonin 5-HT2C receptor null mutant mice were generated to assess the contribution of this receptor to the actions of serotonin, Mutant mice displayed both an epilepsy and obesity phenotype. The epilepsy syndrome was characterized by spontaneous seizures. lowered seizure threshold, enhanced seizure propagation and sound-induced seizure susceptibility, These findings implicate 5-HT2C receptors in the regulation of neuronal network excitability. It was also observed that body weight and adipose tissue deposition were elevated in adult mutant mice relative to their wild type littermates. Paired-feeding studies suggest that the obesity syndrome is a result of increased food intake. In addition, mutants displayed reduced sensitivity to the appetite suppressant actions of nonspecific serotonergic agonists, These studies establish a role for 5-HT2C receptors in the serotonergic regulation of body weight and food intake.
