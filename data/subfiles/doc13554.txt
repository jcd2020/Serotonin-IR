Winter, J. C. and R. A. Rabin (1992). "YOHIMBINE AS A SEROTONERGIC AGENT - EVIDENCE FROM RECEPTOR-BINDING AND DRUG DISCRIMINATION." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 263(2): 682-689.

	Stimulus control was established in rats trained to discriminate either 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (DPAT) (0.2 mg/kg) or yohimbine (3 mg/kg) from saline. Tests of generalization were then conducted with a group of drugs thought to act via the 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor and a group of drugs thought to act as antagonists at alpha2 adrenoceptors. In addition, each drug was characterized in terms of its affinity for 5-HT1A and alpha2 adrenoceptors by means of radioligand binding techniques. It was observed that the stimulus effects of DPAT generalized fully to those of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists, yohimbine, rauwolscine and L-657,743, but not to idazoxan or atipamezole. The dissociation constants (K(d), nM) of the alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonists at the 5-HT1A receptor were 74, 52, 80, 199 and 13,000, respectively. Thus, the discrimination data are explicable in terms of a direct action of yohimbine and some other alpha2 adrenoceptor antagonists upon 5-HT1A receptors. In yohimbine-trained rats, full generalization to DPAT, flesinoxan and tandospirone was observed. In light of the negligible affinity of flesinoxan and tandospirone for the alpha2 adrenoceptor (9000 and 8800 nM, respectively), and high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (0.3 and 43 nM, respectively), a mechanism mediated by the latter site is suggested. We would emphasize two implications of the present study. First, the present data suggest that rats trained with yohimbine as a discriminative stimulus generalize to drugs with minimal affinity for the alpha2 adrenoceptor but with high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. Second, studies in which yohimbine is used to assess the function of the alpha2 adrenoceptor should also consider the possible involvement of 5-HT1A receptors.
