Takahashi, K., et al. (2018). "Antidepressant-like effect of aripiprazole via 5-HT(1A), D(1), and D(2) receptors in the prefrontal cortex of olfactory bulbectomized mice." J Pharmacol Sci 137(3): 241-247.

	Olfactory bulbectomized (OBX) mice exhibit depressive-like behaviors and memory deficits. We have reported that aripiprazole (ARI) ameliorates the behavioral hyper-responsivity to dopamine agonists and memory deficits in OBX mice; however, it is unclear whether ARI affects OBX-induced depressive-like behavior. To address this question, we evaluated the effect of ARI on depressive-like behavior in OBX mice using the forced swim test (FST). In addition, we investigated the effect of ARI on c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), striatum, and hippocampus of OBX mice using western blotting. OBX mice exhibited a longer immobility duration in the FST 14 days after surgery. Depressive-like behavior in OBX mice was reversed 30 min after administration of ARI (0.01 or 0.03 mg/kg). In addition, c-Fos expression was increased in the PFC, but not the striatum or hippocampus, 30 min after acute administration of ARI. These effects were inhibited by administration of the selective 5-HT1A, D1, and D2 receptor antagonists, WAY100635, SCH23390, and L-741,626, respectively. These findings suggest that ARI produces an antidepressant effect in OBX mice that may be mediated by 5-HT(1A), D(1), and D(2) receptors in the PFC.
