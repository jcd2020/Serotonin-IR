Langlois, M., et al. (1992). "DERIVATIVES OF NAPHTHALIMIDE - NEW POTENT CONFORMATIONALLY RESTRICTED ANTAGONISTS OF 5-HT3 RECEPTORS." Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 2(7): 691-694.

	New potent 5-HT3 antagonists were synthesized from naphthalic anhydride and racemic or (R) and (S) 3-aminoquinuclidines. In contrast to zacopride, the activity resided essentially in the (R) enantiomer. Conformational studies demonstrated the presence of a locked structure. The reduction of one carbonyl function yielded equipotent compounds with a loss of enantioselectivity.
