Hayashi, S., et al. (2001). "Serotonin modulates expression of VIP and GRP mRNA via the 5-HT(1B) receptor in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the rat." Exp Neurol 171(2): 285-292.

	The expression of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) changes depending on light. VIP mRNA increases and GRP mRNA decreases in the light phase, while they do not show change without light. In the present study we investigated the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in the expression of VIP and GRP messenger RNA in the SCN of the rat. The decrease in VIP mRNA and the increase in GRP mRNA in the light phase were amplified by 5-HT depletion using 5,6-dihydroxytryptamine injected into the lateral ventricle. These enhancements due to 5-HT depletion were reversed to control levels by applying 5-HT(1B) agonists TFMPP and CGS12066A, but not a 5-HT(1A)/5-HT(7) agonist, 8-OH-DPAT. The 5-HT(1B) receptor is known to exist on the terminals of the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Therefore, next we investigated the morphological relationship of RHT and 5-HT terminals by double-labeling immunocytochemistry and demonstrated that 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers and cholera toxin B subunit-labeled RHT terminals were intermingled in the ventrolateral SCN, and 5-HT axon processes had close contact with RHT terminals. Collectively, these pharmacological and morphological results suggest that 5-HT afferents from raphe nuclei modulate VIP and GRP expression in neurons of the ventrolateral SCN by activating the 5-HT(1B) receptor in the RHT.
