	Background and PurposeIn vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated a protective effect of cannabidiol (CBD) in reducing infarct size in stroke models and against epithelial barrier damage in numerous disease models. We aimed to investigate whether CBD also affects blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability following ischaemia. Experimental ApproachHuman brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) and human astrocyte co-cultures modelled the BBB. Ischaemia was modelled by oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and permeability was measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. Key ResultsCBD (10M) prevented the increase in permeability caused by 4h OGD. CBD was most effective when administered before the OGD, but protective effects were observed up to 2h into reperfusion. This protective effect was inhibited by a PPAR antagonist and partly reduced by a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, but was unaffected by antagonists of cannabinoid CB1 or CB2 receptors, TRPV1 channels or adenosine A(2A) receptors. CBD also reduced cell damage, as measured by LDH release and by markers of cellular adhesion, such as the adhesion molecule VCAM-1. In HBMEC monocultures, CBD decreased VCAM-1 and increased VEGF levels, effects which were inhibited by PPAR antagonism. Conclusions and ImplicationsThese data suggest that preventing permeability changes at the BBB could represent an as yet unrecognized mechanism of CBD-induced neuroprotection in ischaemic stroke, a mechanism mediated by activation of PPAR and 5-HT1A receptors.
