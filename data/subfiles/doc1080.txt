Bockaert, J., et al. (1987). "Piperazine derivatives including the putative anxiolytic drugs, buspirone and ipsapirone, are agonists at 5-HT1A receptors negatively coupled with adenylate cyclase in hippocampal neurons." Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 335(5): 588-592.

	Two putative anxiolytic drugs [ipsapirone (TVXQ 7821) and buspirone], structurally unrelated to benzodiazepines, have negligible ataxic and sedative side effects. These drugs are piperazine analogs which interact at 5-HT1 binding sites. It is demonstrated here that these drugs and two other piperazine derivatives, trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), are agonists at 5-HT1A receptors, a subclass of the 5-HT1 receptor, mediating inhibition of forskolin (100 microM) stimulated adenylate cyclase in particulate fractions of guinea pig hippocampus as well as inhibition of the formation of cyclic AMP promoted by vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (0.1 microM) plus forskolin (1 microM) in mouse hippocampal neurons in primary culture. This study demonstrates that these piperazine based drugs act in both brain homogenate preparations and in intact neurons in a similar manner. The biochemical models described here may aid in the development of even more active drugs in this class.
