	RATIONALE: Serotonin 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptors may play a role in regulating motivation and reward-related behaviours. To date, no studies have investigated the possible role of 5-HT(2C) receptors in ventral tegmental area (VTA) intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated the hypotheses that 5-HT(2C) receptors play an inhibitory role in VTA ICSS, and that 5-HT(2C) receptors within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell may be involved. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with a VTA electrode and bilateral NAc shell cannulae for the experiment involving microinjections, and trained to respond for electrical self-stimulation. The systemic effects of the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist WAY 161503 (0-1.0 mg/kg), the 5-HT(1A/1B/2C) receptor agonist TFMPP (0.3 mg/kg) and the selective 5-HT(2C) receptor antagonist SB 242084 (1.0 mg/kg) were compared using rate-frequency threshold analysis. Intra-NAc shell microinjections of WAY 161503 (0-1.5 microg/side) were investigated and compared to amphetamine (1.0 microg/side). RESULTS: WAY 161503 (1.0 mg/kg) and TFMPP (0.3 mg/kg) significantly increased rate-frequency thresholds (M50 values) without altering maximal response rates (RMAX values). SB 242084 attenuated the effects of TFMPP; SB 242084 had no affect on M50 or RMAX values. Intra-NAc shell WAY 161503 had no effect on M50 or RMAX values; intra-NAc amphetamine decreased M50 values. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 5-HT(2C) receptors play an inhibitory role in regulating reward-related behaviour while 5-HT(2C) receptor activation in the NAc shell did not appear to influence VTA ICSS behaviour under the present experimental conditions.
