	This study determined the in vitro functional profile of 1-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-5-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2quinolinone monomethanesulfonate (OPC-14523) at rat and human serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT1A receptors and binding affinity of OPC-14523 at human frontocortical 5-HT1A receptors. OPC-14523 (1 mu M) increased guanosine-5'-O-(S-35]thio)-triphosphate ([S-35]GTP gamma S) binding to 5-HT1A receptor-containing regions of rat brain tissue sections (similar to 53% of the effect of 1 mu M (+)8-liydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ((+)8-OH-DPAT) that were blocked by the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2 -methoxyphenyl)-l-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635). OPC-14523 also behaved as a partial agonist in its stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding to membranes from rat hippocampus (pEC(50)=7.60 +/- 0.23, E-max =41.1% of the effect of 10 mu M (+)8-OH-DPAT), human frontal cortex (pEC(50)=7.89 +/- 0.08; E-max =64% of the effect of 10 mu M (+)8-OH-DPAT), and Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing cloned human 5-HT1A receptors (pEC(50)=8.0 +/- 0.11; E-max=85.5% of the effect of 10 mu M 5-HT), and all of these effects of OPC-14523 were blocked by WAY-100635. Taken together, these data support the development of OPC-14523 as an antidepressant whose mechanism of action involves potent partial agonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors.
