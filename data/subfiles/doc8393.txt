Okumura, T., et al. (2020). "Adenosine A(1) receptor agonist induces visceral antinociception via 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, dopamine D-1 or cannabinoid CB1 receptors, and the opioid system in the central nervous system." Physiology & Behavior 220.

	We have recently demonstrated that N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), an adenosine A1 receptor agonist, acts centrally to induce a visceral antinociception. Since serotonin (5-HT), cannabinoid (CB), dopamine or opioid signaling in the central nervous system is involved in the regulation of visceral sensation, we made a hypothesis that the signaling may play a role in the CPA-induced visceral antinociception. Visceral sensation was evaluated by colonic distension-induced abdominal withdrawal reflex (AWR) in conscious rats. Subcutaneously administered CPA significantly increased the threshold of colonic distension-induced AWR. Intracisternal injection of either 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocked the CPA-induced visceral antinociception while 5-HT1B antagonist did not block the CPA-induced visceral antinociception. Subcutaneous injection of dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist, CB1 receptor antagonist or naloxone significantly blocked the CPA-induced visceral antinociception while neither subcutaneous injection of dopamine D-2 receptor antagonist nor CB2 receptor antagonist blocked the CPA-induced anti-pain action. These results suggest that 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, dopamine D-1, CB1 receptors and the opioid system in the CNS may specifically mediate the CPA-induced visceral antinociception. These findings may help in understanding the physiological relevance of central adenosine with special reference to the pathophysiology of altered visceral sensation especially in irritable bowel syndrome.
