	Recent evidence suggests that non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonists may regulate serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor neurotransmission in brain. The molecular mechanisms of this regulation are unknown, but could involve cannabinoid-induced enhanced interaction between 5-HT(2A) and dopamine D2 (D(2)) receptors. Here, we present experimental evidence that Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a non-selective cannabinoid receptor agonist (CP55,940, 50 microg/kg, 7 days, i.p.) showed enhanced co-immunoprecipitation of 5-HT(2A) and D(2) receptors and enhanced membrane-associated expression of D(2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors in prefrontal cortex (PFCx). Furthermore, 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA levels were increased in PFCx, suggesting a cannabinoid-induced upregulation of 5-HT(2A) receptors. To date, two cannabinoids receptors have been found in brain, CB1 and CB2 receptors. We used selective cannabinoid agonists in a neuronal cell line to study mechanisms that could mediate this 5-HT(2A) receptor upregulation. We found that selective CB2 receptor agonists upregulate 5-HT(2A) receptors by a mechanism that seems to involve activation of Galpha(i) G-proteins, ERK1/2, and AP-1 transcription factor. We hypothesize that the enhanced cannabinoid-induced interaction between 5-HT(2A) and D(2) receptors and in 5-HT(2A) and D(2) receptors protein levels in the PFCx might provide a molecular mechanism by which activation of cannabinoid receptors might be contribute to the pathophysiology of some cognitive and mood disorders.
