	Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can form multiprotein complexes (heteromers), which can alter the pharmacology and functions of the constituent receptors. Previous findings demonstrated that the G(q/11)-coupled serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and the G(i/o)-coupled metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) receptor-GPCRs that are involved in signaling alterations associated with psychosis-assemble into a heteromeric complex in the mammalian brain. In single-cell experiments with various mutant versions of the mGlu2 receptor, we showed that stimulation of cells expressing mGlu2-5-HT2A heteromers with an mGlu2 agonist led to activation of G(q/11) proteins by the 5-HT2A receptors. For this crosstalk to occur, one of the mGlu2 subunits had to couple to G(i/o) proteins, and we determined the relative location of the G(i/o)-contacting subunit within the mGlu2 homodimer of the heteromeric complex. Additionally, mGlu2-dependent activation of G(q/11), but not G(i/o), was reduced in the frontal cortex of 5-HT2A knockout mice and was reduced in the frontal cortex of postmortem brains from schizophrenic patients. These findings offer structural insights into this important target in molecular psychiatry.
