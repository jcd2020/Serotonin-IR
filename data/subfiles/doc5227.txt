	The widespread distribution of the tumor suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) in the adult brain(1) suggests its role in a broad range of brain functions. Here we show evidence supporting a physical interaction of PTEN with a region in the third intracellular loop (3L4F) of the serotonin 5-HT2C receptor (5-HT2cR, formerly 5-HT1c receptor(2)) in cell cultures. PTEN limits agonist-induced phosphorylation of 5-HT2cR through its protein phosphatase activity. We showed the probable existence of PTEN:5-HT2cR complexes in putative dopaminergic neurons in the rat ventral tegmental area (VTA), a brain region in which virtually all abused drugs exert rewarding effects by activating its dopamine neurons(3,4). We synthesized the interfering peptide Tat-3L4F, which is able to disrupt PTEN coupling with 5-HT2cR. Systemic application of Tat-3L4F or the 5-HT2cR agonist Ro600175 suppressed the increased firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons induced by Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana. Using behavioral tests, we found that Tat-3L4F or Ro600175 blocks conditioned place preference of THC or nicotine, and that Ro600175, but not Tat-3L4F, produces anxiogenic effects, penile erection, hypophagia and motor functional suppression. These results suggest a potential strategy for treating drug addiction with the Tat-3L4F peptide.
