Artigas, F., et al. (2001). "How does pindolol improve antidepressant action?" Trends in Pharmacological Sciences 22(5): 224-228.

	Since 1994, the beta -adrenoceptor and 5-HT1A/1B receptor ligand pindolol has been used to accelerate or enhance the clinical effects of antidepressant drugs, such as the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), that act primarily on 5-HT-containing neurones. Pindolol was initially thought to act by preventing the inhibition of 5-HT release, elicited by SSRIs and other 5-HT-acting drugs, as a result of its ability to antagonize the action of 5-HT at midbrain raphe 5-HT1A autoreceptors that control the activity of ascending 5-HT-mediated pathways. However, the partial agonist properties of pindolol at 5-HT1A receptors and beta -adrenoceptors suggest that other explanations for its action are also possible. In this article, recent controversial data on the mechanism of action of pindolol, which are crucial for the development of more rapid and efficient antidepressant therapies, will be discussed.
