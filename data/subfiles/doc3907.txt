Gothert, M., et al. (1995). "5-HT(3) RECEPTOR ANTAGONISM BY ANPIRTOLINE, A MIXED 5-HT(1) RECEPTOR AGONIST 5-HT(3) RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST." British Journal of Pharmacology 114(2): 269-274.

	1 The aim of this study was to provide evidence that anpirtoline, which is an agonist at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors and also displays submicromolar affinity for 5-HT1A recognition sites, in addition, acts as an antagonist at 5-HT3 receptors. 2 In radioligand binding studies on rat brain cortical membranes, anpirtoline inhibited specific binding of [H-3]-(S)-zacopride to 5-HT3 receptor recognition sites (pK(i): 7.53). 3 In NlE-115 neuroblastoma cells in which [C-14]-guanidinium was used as a tool to measure cation influx through the 5-HT3 receptor channel, the 5-HT-induced influx was concentration-dependently inhibited by anpirtoline. In this respect, anpirtoline mimicked other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists; the rank order of potency was ondansetron> anpirtoline> metoclopramide. 4 The concentration-response curve for 5-HT as a stimulator of [C-14]-guanidinium influx was shifted to the right by anpirtoline (apparent pA(2): 7.78), 5 In urethane-anaesthetized rats, anpirtoline inhibited (at lower potency than zacopride and tropisetron) the 5-HT- or phenylbiguanide-induced bradycardia (Bezold-Jarisch reflex), but did not induce this reflex by itself. 6 Intravenous infusion of cisplatin in the domestic pig caused a consistent emetic response which was antagonized by anpirtoline. 7 It is concluded that anpirtoline, which was previously characterized as a 5-HT1 receptor agonist also proved to be a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist in several experimental models and, hence, exhibits a unique pattern of properties at different 5-HT receptors.
