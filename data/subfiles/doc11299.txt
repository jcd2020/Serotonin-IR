	Serotonin (5-HT) effects on physostigmine (PHY)-induced yawning were studied in LY Sprague-Dawley rats by injecting Lu 10 171 (citalopram), a specific 5-HT uptake blocker, and two antagonists-methiothepine and ritanserin-which differ slightly in the selectivity of their actions on different 5-HT receptor subtypes. Infant and young rats show significant increases in PHY-induced yawning when preinjected with citalopram (5-10 mg/kg). Two-month-old animals show this effect only with 10 mg/kg. With adult animals (3-5 months old), the effect is the opposite: Yawning decreases. The facilitatory effect in infant and young rats was counteracted by methiothepine but not by ritanserin, suggesting that it is mediated through 5-HT1A or 5-HT1B receptor subtypes. The inhibitory effect of citalopram in adult rats was unmodified by the two antagonists used, leaving open the possibility that it is mediated by 5-HT3 receptors.
