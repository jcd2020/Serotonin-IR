Brotto, L. A., et al. (1998). "Effects of housing conditions and 5-HT2A activation on male rat sexual behavior." Physiol Behav 63(4): 475-479.

	Adult male rats were housed individually or in groups for a period of 39 days. In Experiment 1, the effects of housing conditions on sexual behavior and concurrent spontaneous "wet dog shaking" (WDS) were investigated. Individual housing significantly impaired male sexual behavior and resulted in a trend toward increased WDS. In Experiment 2, the effects of housing conditions were examined following administration of the serotonergic type 2A (5-HT2A) agonist DOI. Individual housing significantly increased DOI-induced WDS. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of stress-induced corticosterone secretion and the possible regulatory effect on 5-HT2A receptors. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.
