Ishibashi, H., et al. (2000). "Inhibition of the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inwardly rectifying K+ current by dextromethorphan in rat dorsal raphe neurones." Neuropharmacology 39(12): 2302-2308.

	The effect of dextromethorphan (DM on the inwardly rectifying K+ currents mediated by 5-HT1A receptors in acutely dissociated dorsal raphe (DR) neurones of rats was studied using nystatin-perforated patch and conventional whole-cell patch recording configurations under voltage-clamp conditions. DM rapidly and reversibly inhibited the K+ currents induced by 10(-7) hi 5-HT in a concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximum inhibitory concentration of 1.43x10(-5) M. The inhibitory effect of DM was neither voltage- nor use-dependent. DM caused a suppression of the maximum response of the 5-HT concentration-response curve, thus suggesting a non-competitive type of inhibition. In neurones perfused intracellularly with a pipette-solution containing the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog GTP gamma S, 5-HT activated K+ currents in an irreversible manner. DM suppressed the current irreversibly activated by intracellular GTP gamma S even in the absence of the agonist. DM also inhibited the inwardly rectifying K+ currents regulated by alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in freshly isolated rat locus coeruleus neurones. These results suggest that DM may inhibit the G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels, but not the neurotransmitter receptors, in the central nervous system. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
