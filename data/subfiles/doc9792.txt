Overstreet, D. H., et al. (2003). "A 5-HT1A agonist and a 5-HT2c antagonist reduce social interaction deficit induced by multiple ethanol withdrawals in rats." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 167(4): 344-352.

	Rationale: Repeated withdrawals from chronic forced ethanol exposure sensitize animals to withdrawal-induced deficits in social interaction behavior. The deficits in social interaction behavior following withdrawal from continuous ethanol exposure can be reduced following acute treatments with 5-HT2C antagonists or 5-HT1A agonists. Objectives: The present study investigated whether prior treatment with these serotonergic agents during early withdrawals in rats subjected to repeated withdrawals from ethanol exposure would ameliorate the social interaction deficits observed following the final withdrawal. Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to three cycles of 5 days forced ethanol (7%, w/v), with 2 days of control diet after the first and second cycles. Drugs were administered IP 4 h after removal of ethanol on the first and second cycles but not the third in one group and 4.5 h after removal of ethanol on the third cycle in another. The social interaction test was performed 5 h after removal of ethanol on the third cycle. Drugs tested included SB-242084, a 5-HT2C antagonist; buspirone, a 5-HT1A partial agonist; WAY-100635, a 5-HT1A antagonist; ketanserin, a 5-HT2A antagonist; ritanserin, a mixed 5-HT2A/2C antagonist; and Ro-601075, a 5-HT2C agonist. Results: Both SB-242084 and buspirone reduced ethanol withdrawal-induced deficits in social interaction when given either acutely 30 min before the test or at 4 h after withdrawal from the first and second cycles. WAY-100635 and ketanserin were completely ineffective regardless of mode of treatment. In contrast, the 5-HT2C agonist, Ro-601075, accentuated the withdrawal-induced deficit in social interaction behavior in rats exposed to either 4.5 or 7% ethanol diet. Conclusions: These results support the utility of 5-HT1A agonists and 5-HT2C antagonists in reducing anxiety-like behavior induced by ethanol withdrawal and reducing the adaptive changes associated with repeated withdrawals.
