López-Rodríguez, M. L., et al. (1997). "Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a new model of arylpiperazines. 3.1 2-[omega-(4-arylpiperazin-1-yl)alkyl]perhydropyrrolo- [1,2-c]imidazoles and -perhydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridines: study of the influence of the terminal amide fragment on 5-HT1A affinity/selectivity." J Med Chem 40(16): 2653-2656.

	A series of new arylpiperazine derivatives 2, which are devoid of the terminal amide fragment present in related 5-HT1A ligands, was prepared and evaluated for affinity at 5-HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. All the compounds 2 demonstrated high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and moderate affinity for alpha 1 receptor binding sites. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies suggest that there is influence of electronic factors on the no-pharmacophoric part of the alpha 1 receptor site. However there is no influence of electronic interactions on the stabilization of the 5-HT1A receptor-ligand complex.
