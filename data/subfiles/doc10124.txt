Sestile, C. C., et al. (2017). "B2-kinin receptors in the dorsal periaqueductal gray are implicated in the panicolytic-like effect of opiorphin." Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology & Biological Psychiatry 79: 493-498.

	Reported results have shown that the pentapeptide opiorphin inhibits oligopeptidases that degrade brain neuropeptides, and has analgesic and antidepressant effects in experimental animals, without either tolerance or dependency after chronic administration. In a previous study we showed that opiorphin has a panicolytic-like effect in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG) electrical stimulation test (EST), mediated by the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). This study further analyzes the mechanism of opiorphin panicolytic action, using the EST and drug injection inside the dPAG. The obtained results showed that blockade of the 5-HT1A receptors with WAY-100635 did not change the escape-impairing effect of opiorphin, and combined injection of sub-effective doses of opiorphin and the 5-HT1A-agonist 8-OH-DPAT did not have a significant anti-escape effect. In contrast, the anti-escape effect of opiorphin was antagonized by pretreatment with the kinin B2 receptor blocker HOE-140, and association of sub-effective doses of opiorphin and bradykinin caused a significant anti-escape effect. The anti-escape effect of bradykinin was not affected by previous administration of WAY-100635. Therefore, the anti-escape effect of opiorphin in the dPAG seems to be mediated by endogenous bradykinin, acting on kinin B2 receptors, which previous results have shown to interact synergistically with MOR in the dPAG to restrain escape in two animal models of panic.
