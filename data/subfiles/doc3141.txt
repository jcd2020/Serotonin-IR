Domeney, A. M., et al. (1991). "THE EFFECT OF ONDANSETRON ON COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE MARMOSET." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 38(1): 169-175.

	The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, ondansetron, was administered to marmosets to determine its effect on their performance in a Wisconsin General Test Apparatus using an object discrimination reversal learning task. Briefly, this comprised a test situation in which marmosets were required to select a food rewarded object to reach criterion in performance (this was termed the initial discrimination task); the rewarded object was then changed (in the same test session) and the marmoset was required to abandon its recently learned strategy to gain reward by selection of the second object (this was termed the reversal task). At doses of 1-10 ng/kg SC b.i.d. ondansetron improved performance in both the initial discrimination and reversal tasks. This was indicated as a reduction in the number of trials required to reach criterion, a reduction in choice latency time and a reduction in the number of errors made in each test session. Higher doses of ondansetron impaired performance as measured by several criteria. The major conclusion of this study is, therefore, that ondansetron at low doses is able to improve the performance of marmosets in a cognitive task. This would support the concept that a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist can act as a cognitive enhancer.
