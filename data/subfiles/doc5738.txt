Ichikawa, J. and H. Y. Meltzer (2000). "The effect of serotonin(1A) receptor agonism on antipsychotic drug-induced dopamine release in rat striatum and nucleus accumbens." Brain Res 858(2): 252-263.

	Serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonism may be of interest in regard to both the antipsychotic action and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) of antipsychotic drugs (APD) based, in part, on the effect of 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation on the release of dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAC) and striatum (STR), respectively. We investigated the effect of R(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (R(+)-8-OH-DPAT) and n-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-n-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohe xanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY100635), a selective 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist and antagonist, respectively, on basal and APD-induced DA release. In both STR and NAC, R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.2 mg/kg) decreased basal DA release; R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg) inhibited DA release produced by the 5-HT(2A)/D(2) receptor antagonists clozapine (20 mg/kg), low dose risperidone (0.01 and 0. 03 mg/kg) and amperozide (10 mg/kg), but not that produced by high dose risperidone (0.1 and 1.0 mg/kg) or haloperidol (0.01-1.0 mg/kg), potent D(2) receptor antagonists. This R(+)-8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of the effects of clozapine, risperidone and amperozide was antagonized by WAY100635 (0.05 mg/kg). WAY100635 (0.1-0.5 mg/kg) alone increased DA release in the STR but not NAC. The selective 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist M100907 (1 mg/kg) did not alter the effect of R(+)-8-OH-DPAT or WAY100635 alone on basal DA release in either region. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) receptor stimulation inhibits basal and some APD-induced DA release in the STR and NAC, and that this effect is unlikely to be mediated by an interaction with 5-HT(2A) receptors. The significance of these results for EPS and antipsychotic action is discussed.
