Watson, J. A., et al. (1995). "SEROTONIN ELEVATES INTRACELLULAR CA2+IN RAT CHOROID-PLEXUS EPITHELIAL-CELLS BY ACTING ON 5-HT2C RECEPTORS." Cell Calcium 17(2): 120-128.

	The effects of serotonin (5-HT) on intracellular calcium activity ([Ca2+](i)) in epithelial cells from rat choroid plexuses were examined. Experiments were performed on isolated cells which had been maintained in primary culture. [Ca2+](i) was measured using micro-spectrofluorimetric techniques and the fluorescent indicator Fura-2. 5-HT was found to increase [Ca2+](i) in a dose dependent manner. The [Ca2+](i) response was biphasic, with an initial peak of [Ca2+](i) (due to release from intracellular stores), followed by an elevated plateau phase (the result of calcium influx). The effect of 1 mu M 5-HT was inhibited by mesulergine and mianserin (50 nM), which are antagonists of the 5-HT2C receptor. Spiperone and ketanserin (200 nM), less specific 5-HT2 receptor blockers, caused only a slight reduction in the response to 1 mu M 5-HT. The [Ca2+](i) response decreased upon repeated challenges with 1 mu M 5-HT, probably as a result of receptor desensitisation, Taken together, the data suggest that 5-HT acts at 5-HT2C receptors to increase [Ca2+](i) in choroid plexus epithelial cells, both by liberating Ca2+ from intracellular stores and by activating a Ca2+ influx pathway.
