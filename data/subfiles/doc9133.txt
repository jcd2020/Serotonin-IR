	OBJECTIVE: To explore the interrelationship among dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), locus coeruleus (LC) and raphe magnus nucleus (NRM) in the mechanism of the descending regulation on gastric motility, which may constitute a parasympathetic local circuit, work as a neural center of gastric modulation in brainstem. METHODS: Using nucleus location, electric stimulation and lesion, together with microinjection, and recording the inter-gastric pressure. RESULTS: (1) LC stimulation could inhibit the gastric motility significantly (P < 0.01), DMV lesion weaken this effect, while blocking the a receptor on DMV could reverse the effect. (2) NRM stimulation reduced the amplitude of gastric constriction (P < 0.01), DMV lesion could abolish the effect, but blocking the 5-HT2A receptor on DMV depressed the gastric motility heavily (P < 0.01) like NRM stimulation. While LC lesion could abolish the effect of NRM stimulation, and microinjection of ritanserin into LC could likewise abolish it. CONCLUSION: (1) LC inhibit the gastric motility via a receptor in DMV, and meanwhile may excite it through 5-HT2A receptor in DMV, these two ways work together to keeping the gastric motility amplitude normally. (2) NRM inhibit the gastric motility via 5-HT2A receptor in LC.
