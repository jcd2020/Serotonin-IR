	The anatomy of the 5-HT system in the medulla oblongata is well defined in several vertebrate species, but not in the piglet. A detailed map and developmental profile of this system is particularly important in the piglet because this species increasingly is used as a model for physiological studies of medullary homeostatic control and its disorders in human infancy, especially the sudden infant death syndrome. Tryptophan hydroxylase immunohistochemistry was used to identify 5-HT cells and map their distribution in the medullae of piglets between postnatal days 4 and 30, the putative comparable period to early human infancy. Tritiated (3H)-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) binding to 5-HT1A-D and 5-HT2 receptors and 3H-8-hydroxy-2-[di-N-propylamine]tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) binding to 5-HT1A receptors were used to quantify and map the distribution of these serotonin receptors between 4 and 60 postnatal days. The distribution of 5-HT cells was similar to that observed in other vertebrate species, with cell bodies in and lateral to the caudal raphe. Tritiated-LSD and 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding both showed significant age-related changes in select raphe and extra-raphe subnuclei. Taken together, these findings suggest that while the medullary 5-HT cells are topographically in place at birth in the piglet, changes in 5-HT neurotransmission take place during the first 30 days of life, as reflected by changes in patterns of receptor binding. Therefore, the first 30 days of life represent a critical period in the development of the 5-HT system and the homeostatic functions it mediates.
