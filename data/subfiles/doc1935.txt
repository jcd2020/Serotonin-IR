	In invertebrates, serotonin (5-HT) is involved in both non-associative and associative learning, and thus memory formation. Indeed, as shown in Aplysia californica, snails, leeches, etc., whereas the formation of memories is more difficult after 5-HT depletion, it is facilitated when serotonin functions are stimulated. Although it is generally considered that the evolution can be relatively conservative, the overall picture is much more complicated in higher vertebrates: when 5-HT systems are selectively damaged, the lesions have behavioral consequences, as can be evidenced, for instance, in rats or mice (e.g., on impulsivity), but learning is still possible, and most often memory capabilities appear normal. Serotonergic functions may also be enhanced by pharmacological tools, such as drugs inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT (SSRIs). Although there is no consensus in the literature, SSRIs may have two types of effects according to whether they are given before or after training. When SSRIs are given before training, memory functions appear unchanged in some reports or altered in others; exceptionally, they can be improved. Given immediately after training, such drugs have no effect on memory or may improve it. In higher vertebrates, modifications of 5-HT functions have nevertheless consequences on the mnesic impact of treatments affecting other neurotransmitter functions, such as blockade of cholinergic receptors or cholinergic lesions. Therefore, with regard to learning and memory, one of the roles of the ascending serotonergic system taken as a whole could be to modulate more direct functional implications of other neurotransmitter systems. These modulations could operate in a region-specific and perhaps receptor-specific manner.
