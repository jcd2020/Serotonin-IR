Choi, S., et al. (2004). "Serotonin reuptake inhibitors do not prevent 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-induced depletion of serotonin in rat brain." Brain Res 1007(1-2): 19-28.

	Although the selective toxicity of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) is thought to depend on the drug's transport into serotonin (5HT) neurons via the 5HT transporter, few studies have critically examined this postulation. We therefore evaluated if 5,7-DHT-induced reductions in 5HT concentrations and synthesis rate in rat brain are blocked by pretreatment with 5HT-selective reuptake inhibitors. Rats pretreated with desipramine (DMI) (to prevent norepinephrine depletion) received intracerebroventricular injections of 5,7-DHT (5, 50, 100, 200 microg/rat) 30 min after fluoxetine (20 mg/kg ip). Forty-eight hours later, they received m-hydroxybenzylhydrazine 30 min before sacrifice. The concentrations of 5HT and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP, an index of 5HT synthesis) were measured in hypothalamus, cortex and brainstem. Each 5,7-DHT dose produced significant reductions in 5HT and 5HTP concentrations in all regions examined (5 microg reduced 5HT but not 5HTP), effects that were not blocked by fluoxetine. Two other 5HT reuptake blockers (chlorimipramine, alaproclate) also failed to block the 5HT and 5HTP depleting actions of 5,7-DHT. Desipramine blocked 5,7-DHT-induced norepinephrine (NE) depletion. Pretreatment with the 5HT receptor antagonist metergoline, or the 5HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (to slow 5HT neuronal firing rate) also failed to antagonize the 5HT depleting action of 5,7-DHT. Together, the data strongly suggest that the mechanism by which 5,7-DHT depletes the brain of serotonin does not involve 5HT-transporter-mediated concentration of neurotoxin in 5HT neurons, may not involve 5HT receptor interaction, and does not depend on the firing rate of the 5HT neuron.
