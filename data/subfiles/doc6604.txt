López-Rodríguez, M. L., et al. (1998). "1-[omega-(4-arylpiperazin-1-yl)alkyl]-3-diphenylmethylene-2,5- pyrrolidinediones as 5-HT1A receptor ligands: study of the steric requirements of the terminal amide fragment on 5-HT1A affinity/selectivity." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 8(6): 581-586.

	In the present paper, we report the synthesis and the binding profile on 5-HT1A, alpha 1 and D2 receptors of a new series of imide-arylpiperazines 3. The study of the length of the alkyl chain and the imide substructure allows us to suggest some important differences between the no-pharmacophoric sites of both 5-HT1A and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, which could be of great importance in order to design new selective ligands.
