Blessing, W. W. (2004). "5-hydroxytryptamine 1A receptor activation reduces cutaneous vasoconstriction and fever associated with the acute inflammatory response in rabbits." Neuroscience 123(1): 1-4.

	5-Hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor activation reduces body temperature partially by dilating the thermoregulatory cutaneous vascular bed, thereby increasing heat transfer to the environment. Constriction of this vascular bed, with consequent reduction of heat transfer to the environment, contributes to fever associated with the acute inflammatory response. Thus activation of 5-HT1A receptors might inhibit thermoregulatory cutaneous vasoconstriction and reduce the fever associated with the acute inflammatory response. The present study tested this hypothesis in conscious unrestrained rabbits. The acute inflammatory reaction was induced with i.v. lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.5 mug/kg). Body temperature was measured with an i.p. telemetric probe, and ear pinna blood flow was measured with a chronically implanted Doppler ultrasonic probe. 5-HT1A receptors were activated with i.v. 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). LPS increased body temperature by +1.7+/-0.2 degreesC during the first hour after administration. The ear pinna Doppler blood flow signal fell from 69+/-11 to 5+/-1 cm/s within 15 min (n=7, P<0.01) and remained at a low level for approximately 1 h after LPS. When administered 45 min after LPS, 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) reversed this fall, increasing the Doppler signal from 6+/-1 to 55+/-7 cm/s, (P<0.01, n=6), and reduced the rise in body temperature. Treatment with 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) 5 min before and 30 min after LPS entirely prevented the LPS-induced fall in ear pinna blood flow, and reduced the rise in body temperature from 1.7+/-0.2 degreesC to 0.7+/-0.2 (n=7, P<0.01). Treatment with WAY-100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride) (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) prevented and reversed the effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Thus activation of 5-HT1A receptors reduces thermoregulatory cutaneous vasoconstriction and fever occurring as part of the acute inflammatory response. Our findings elucidate the neurotransmitter mechanisms underlying expression of an important component of the febrile response, and suggest that drugs with 5-HT1A agonist properties might be therapeutically useful when it is clinically important to reduce this response.
