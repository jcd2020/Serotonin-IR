	Dysfunction of the serotonin (5-HT1A) receptor (5-HTR1A) has been implicated in mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychosis and the action of antidepressants. A common C(-1018)G [C(-1019)G] functional polymorphism in the promoter region of the human 5-HT1A receptor gene has been reported, which may be useful in identifying psychopathology associated with altered function of the human 5-HT1A receptor. We studied the relationship of this polymorphism to psychopathology and 5-HT1A binding in prefrontal cortex. The 5-HT1A receptor genotype for the C(-1019)G polymorphism was typed in 696 unrelated psychiatric subjects, 107 unrelated healthy volunteers, and in post-mortem brain samples from 241 cases. 5-HT1A receptor binding was assayed in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, and specific binding determined by 1 mum 5-HT. An association of genotype distribution and allele frequency of the 5-HTR1A C(-1019)G locus was observed in schizophrenia (x(2) = 9.51, d.f. = 2, p = 0.009; x(2) = 9.52, d.f. = 1, p = 0.002; Armitage's trend test: x(2) = 9.07, d.f. = 1, p = 0.003), in substance use disorder (x(2) = 8.41, d.f.=2, p = 0.015; x(2) = 8.35, d.f.=1, p = 0.004; Armitage's trend test: x(2) = 6.27, d.f.=1, p = 0.0012), and in panic attack (x(2) = 6.31, d.f.=2, p = 0.043; x(2) = 6.14, d.f.=1, p = 0.013; Armitage's trend test: x(2) = 6.27, d.f.=1, p = 0.012). An association of the 5-HTR1A C(-1019)G locus with schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and panic attack was suggested by our results. In post-mortem brain samples, 5-HT1A receptor binding in prefrontal cortex and suicide were not associated with genotype. The relationship does not appear to be explained by binding differences, although we cannot rule out altered receptor affinity and transduction.
