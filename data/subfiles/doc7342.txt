	Fluoxetine has been reported to suppress food intake in animal models of feeding. Fluoxetine increases extracellular serotonin in the brain. 5HT1A autoreceptors regulate synaptic levels of serotonin. A combination of a 5HT1A receptor antagonist and fluoxetine has been previously reported to enhance extracellular levels of serotonin over what is obtained with fluoxetine alone. Thus, a combination of fluoxetine and a 5HT1A antagonist could enhance the ability of fluoxetine to suppress appetite. Fluoxetine was tested in a model of feeding, in which CD-1 mice were trained to drink sweetened condensed milk. Fluoxetine was found to attenuate milk drinking, in a dose-dependent manner, at doses greater than 10 mg/kg, i.p. A 10 mg/kg dose of fluoxetine, which was ineffective by itself, was then combined either with 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP), a serotonin precursor, or with S(-) pindolol, a 5HT1A/beta adrenergic receptor antagonist or with LY206130, a more selective 5HT1A receptor antagonist. These treatment paradigms resulted in significant attenuation of the consumption of sweetened condensed milk. Since fluoxetine has been shown to be useful in the treatment of eating disorders and to promote weight loss in obese humans, although at doses greater than those required for the treatment of depression, a combination of fluoxetine with a 5HT1A receptor antagonist could be of clinical utility in the treatment of eating disorders and obesity.
