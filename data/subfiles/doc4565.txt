	Introduction: The 5-HT2A receptor is one of the most interesting targets within the scrotonergic system because it is involved in a number of important physiological processes and diseases. Methods: [F-18]MH.MZ, a 5-HT2A antagonistic receptor ligand, is labeled by F-18-fluoroalkylation of the corresponding desinethyl analogue MDL 105725 with 2-[F-18]fluoroethyltosylate ([F-18]FETos). In vitro binding experiments were performed to test selectivity toward a broad spectrum of neuroreceptors by radioligand binding assays. Moreover, first micro-positron emission tomography (p PET) experiments, ex vivo organ biodistribution, blood cell and protein binding and brain metabolism studies of [F-18]MH.MZ were carried out ill rats. Results: [F-18]MH.MZ showed a K-i of 3 nM toward the 5-HT2A receptor and no appreciable affinity for a variety of receptors and transporters. Ex vivo biodistribution as well as mu PET showed highest brain uptake at similar to 5 min p.i. and steady state after similar to 30 min p.i. While [F-18]MH.MZ undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism which significantly reduces its bioavailability, it is insignificantly metabolized within the: brain. The binding potential in the rat frontal cortex is 1.45, whereas the cortex to cerebellum ratio was determined to be 2.7 after similar to 30 min. Conclusion: Results from mu PET measurements of [F-18]MH.MZ are in no way interior to data known for [C-11]MDL 100907 at least in rats. [F-18]MH.MZ appears to be a highly potent and selective scrotonergic PET ligand in small animals. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
