Avgustinovich, D. F. and M. K. Fomina (2012). "[Effects of buspirone on the behavior of female mice in a model of social discomfort]." Ross Fiziol Zh Im I M Sechenova 98(6): 693-705.

	The influence of acute and chronic (14 days) buspirone administration (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on the behavior of C57BL/6J female mice, being in social discomfort, were studied. The conditions of social discomfort include the permanent habitation of females in the cage with aggressive males through a perforated partition and daily presence during intermale confrontations. The dynamic changes of 5-HT1A-receptor sensitivity in the brain of female mice, estimated by the female behavior after 30 min ofbuspirone administration, were discovered. The sensitivity increased at the early stages of pathological behavior development (10 days) and decreased after 20-30 days. Females who had reduced of 5-HT1A receptor sensitivity after 30 day of maintenance in social discomfort conditions also showed a decreased sensitivity on chronic buspirone administration.
