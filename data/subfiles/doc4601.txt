Hidaka, K., et al. (1996). "In vitro pharmacological profile of YM-43611, a novel D-2-like receptor antagonist with high affinity and selectivity for dopamine D-3 and D-4 receptors." British Journal of Pharmacology 117(8): 1625-1632.

	We investigated some neurochemical properties of a novel benzamide, YM-43611, [(S)-N-(1-benzyl-3-pyrrolidinyl)-5-chloro -4-cyclopropylcarbonylamino-2-methoxybenzamide] in comparison with putative D-2-like receptor antagonists using both rat and human cloned dopamine D-2-like receptors in vitro. 2 Receptor binding studies revealed that YM-43611 had appropriately potent affinities for both rat and human D-2-like receptors, with moderate selectivity for D-3 receptors and high selectivity for D-4 receptors over D-2 receptors (K-i values (nM) for rat receptors: D-2, 165; D-3, 35.5; D-4, 1.85, and for human receptors: D-2, 42.9; D-3, 11.2; D-4, 2.10). 3 YM-43611 displayed weak or negligible affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors, namely D-1, D-5, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT3, H-1, M(1) and M(2) receptors. 4 Dopamine stimulated low-K-m GTPase activity on membranes from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the human D-2-like receptor subtype. This response to dopamine of low-K-m GTPase activity was inhibited by use of putative D-2-like receptor antagonists. YM-43611 showed a moderate selectivity for D-3 receptors (K-i = 45.5 nM) and a high selectivity for D-4 receptors (K-i = 3.28 nM) over D-2 receptors (K-i = 70.6 nM). 5 Dopamine inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in intact CHO cells expressing the human D-2-like receptor subtype. YM-43611 shifted the inhibition curve of dopamine on respective D-2-like receptor subtype-mediated cyclic AMP formation to the right in a parallel fashion, showing a pA(2) value of 7.42 (38.1 nM) for D-2 receptors, a pK(B) value of 8.06 (8.68 nM) for D-3 receptors, and a pA(2) value of 8.42 (3.77 nM) for D-4 receptors. 6 YM-43611 but not the other D-2-like receptor antagonists exhibited good selectivity with respect to dual antagonism for D-3 and D-4 receptors in both receptor binding and functional assays. 7 These results indicate that YM-43611 is a novel D-2-like receptor antagonist with high potency and selectivity for both D-3 and D-4 receptors. YM-43611 is therefore expected to be valuable in exploration of the physiological role of D-3 and D-4 receptors.
