Loiseau, F., et al. (2008). "Pro-cognitive effects of 5-HT6 receptor antagonists in the social recognition procedure in rats: implication of the frontal cortex." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 196(1): 93-104.

	RATIONALE: 5-HT6 receptor antagonists improve cognitive processes in rodents. However, their site(s) of action remains unexplored and their influence upon social memory has been little investigated. OBJECTIVES: We examined the influence of 5-HT6 receptor ligands upon social memory in rats by use of systemic or local administration into the frontal cortex (FCX), striatum, or nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The social recognition test is based upon the ability of an adult rat to recognize a younger conspecific during the second of two 5-min sessions. In a procedure without an inter-session interval, the actions of drugs alone and the ability to reverse "amnesia" induced by the muscarinic antagonist, scopolamine (1.25 mg/kg, s.c.), were examined. The potential promnesic effect of drugs was also investigated in another procedure where a spontaneous deficit of recognition was induced by a 120-min inter-session interval. RESULTS: The 5-HT6 receptor agonist, WAY-181187 (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.), significantly impaired social recognition. This effect was abolished by the 5-HT6 receptor antagonists, SB-271046 (20.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and SB-258585 (10.0 mg/kg, i.p.). These agents also abolished scopolamine-induced amnesia (10.0 and 2.5 mg/kg, i.p., respectively) and reversed the delay-induced deficit (10.0-20.0 and 2.5-10.0 mg/kg, i.p., respectively). WAY-181187 into the FCX significantly impaired social recognition (0.16-0.63 microg/side). Conversely, SB-271046 into the FCX (2.5-5.0 microg/side), but neither into the striatum nor the NBM, significantly reversed spontaneous deficit. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that 5-HT6 receptors modulate social recognition by actions in the FCX and underpin their pertinence as targets for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in which cognitive function is compromised.
