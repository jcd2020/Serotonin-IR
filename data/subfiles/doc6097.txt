	Using PET neuroimaging, we demonstrated that four frontotemporal lobar dementia (FTLD) patients had significantly decreased serotonin 5-HT1A binding potential (BP) compared with controls in all 10 brain regions examined. These pilot data suggest that profound 5-HT1A BP losses may be present and contribute to symptomatology and treatment response in FTLD. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
