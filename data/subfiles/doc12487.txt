	Anxiety disorders are the most common behavioral disorders, and they exhibit high comorbidity rates. The aim of the present study was to confirm the effects of Amibegron, the first selective beta 3 adrenergic agent, on anxiety and to demonstrate that different serotoninergic receptor subtypes are involved in this effect. We administered the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635, the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist Ketanserin and the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist Ondansetron in mice and evaluated their performance in the elevated plus-maze test. Mice administered with Amibegron (5 and 10 mg/kg) showed a dose-dependent prolonged time spent in the open arms and an increase in the number of entries into the open arms during the elevated plus-maze (EPM) test. However, in the control mice, administration of WAY, Ketanserin and Ondansetron demonstrated no effect on the time spent in the open arms and the number of entries into the open arms. In addition, these treatments all significantly reversed the effect of the Amibegron-induced (10 mg/kg) increase in the time spent in the open arms. However, only WAY and Ketanserin treatments reversed the Amibegron-induced increase in the number of entries into the open arms. In conclusion, Amibegron exerted a significant anxiolytic effect, which was as effective as Diazepam, in mice during the EPM test. This effect of Amibegron may be mediated by interactions with the serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
