	The nonergot ligand pardoprunox (SLV308) is a dopamine (DA) D(2)/D(3) and serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonist and a new candidate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. We used in vivo electrophysiological paradigm in the rat to assess the effects of pardoprunox on DA neuronal activity in ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) as well as on 5-HT neuronal activity in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). In the VTA, pardoprunox (2-20 mug kg(-)(1), i.v.) decreased partially the firing activity of DA neurons. Interestingly, the bursting activity of VTA DA neurons was completely suppressed. This compound both reversed and prevented the inhibition of firing rate induced by the full D(2)-like receptor agonist apomorphine, confirming its partial D(2)-like receptor agonistic property. Surprisingly in the SNc, pardoprunox (10 mug kg(-)(1), i.v.) either partially or fully suppressed the firing activity in two separate populations of DA neurons. Finally, in the DRN, pardoprunox (5-40 mug kg(-)(1), i.v.) completely suppressed the firing activity of 5-HT neurons. Moreover, the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 prevented and reversed the effects of pardoprunox. The present study shows that pardoprunox acts in the VTA as a potent partial D(2)-like receptor agonist reducing preferentially the burst activity linked to the phasic activity of DA neurons. Unexpectedly in the SNc, pardoprunox behaves either as apartial or a full D(2)-like receptor agonist. Finally in the DRN, pardoprunox is a potent full 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist. Hence, this in vivo study suggests that pardoprunox represents a promising approach for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
