	1. Azapirones, selective partial agonists at the 5-HT1A receptor subtype, induce hypothermia and corticotropin (ACTH)/cortisol release as specific functional correlates of central 5-HT1A receptor activation. 2. Compared to controls, hypothermic and ACTH/cortisol responses to the azapirone ipsapirone are attenuated in patients with unipolar depression and panic disorder but not in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The impaired thermic and neuroendocrine responses are associated with increased basal cortisol secretion in depressed patients but not in patients with panic disorder. 3. Chronic treatment with the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine decreases 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, while long-term treatment with the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline further decreases hypothermia following ipsapirone but has no effect on ACTH/cortisol release. 4. Alteration of the 5-HT1A receptor and/or its signal transduction pathways may play a role in the pathophysiology and treatment of anxiety disorders and depression.
