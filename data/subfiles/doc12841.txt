Uchiyama, S., et al. (2007). "Effect of sarpogrelate, a 5-HT(2A) antagonist, on platelet aggregation in patients with ischemic stroke: clinical-pharmacological dose-response study." Cerebrovasc Dis 24(2-3): 264-270.

	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: It is widely accepted that antiplatelet therapy is effective for secondary prevention of atherosclerotic vascular diseases. We performed a double-blind, controlled clinical-pharmacological study to investigate the antiplatelet efficacy of sarpogrelate, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(2A)) receptor antagonist, in patients with ischemic stroke, using a new assessment system employing combinations of 5-HT and epinephrine as agonists. METHODS: Forty-seven patients with ischemic stroke were randomly assigned to three groups: 15 patients received 25 mg sarpogrelate (group L), 16 patients received 50 mg (group M), and 15 patients received 100 mg (group H) orally, three times daily for 7 days. The effect was expressed as maximum intensity of platelet aggregation on the last day of medication. Two combinations of agonists, 0.5 micromol/l 5-HT plus 3 micromol/l epinephrine, and 1 micromol/l 5-HT plus 3 micromol/l epinephrine, were used to induce platelet aggregation. RESULTS: With both combinations of agonists, sarpogrelate treatment inhibited platelet aggregation dose-dependently (p < 0.025, Jonckheere test). In multiple-group comparison, the effect in group H was greater than that in group L or M (p < 0.025, Wilcoxon rank-sum test). CONCLUSION: Sarpogrelate treatment inhibited platelet aggregation dose-dependently in patients with ischemic stroke, as judged by a new assessment system employing combinations of 5-HT and epinephrine as agonists.
