	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), commonly known as serotonin, has diverse physiological roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). 5-HT is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are five receptor subtypes within the G-protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F. 5-HT1B Receptors are abundantly present in the pallidum, substantia nigra, ventral striatum, and visual cortex. 5-HT1B Receptors are implicated in anxiety, depression, aggressive behavior, and substance abuse disorders (5-9), and these receptors play an important role in modulation of synaptic release of 5-HT (10). Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of 5-HT1B receptors with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. 5-Methyl-8-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide (AZ10419369) was reported to be a potent ligand of 5-HT1B receptors (inhibition constant (Ki) = 0.8 nM) (11). This led to the development of 5-methyl-8-(4-[(11)C]methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide ([(11)C]AZ10419369) as a useful tool for in vivo PET imaging of the 5-HT1B receptor (11).
