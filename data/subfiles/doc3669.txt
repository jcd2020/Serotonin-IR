	OBJECTIVE: To explore the central mechanisms of anger emotion and the effects of Chinese herbal medicines for regulating liver qi on the anger emotion and the expression level of 5-hydroxytryptamine 3B receptor (5-HT3BR) in rat hypothalamus. METHODS: Rat models of anger-in or anger-out emotions were prepared by the methods of resident intruder paradigm. There were five groups in this study: control, anger-in model, Jingqianshu Granule-treated anger-in, anger-out model and Jingqianping Granule-treated anger-out groups. The treatment groups were orally given Jingqianshu granules and Jingqianping granules respectively, and the model groups and the normal control group were given sterile water. Open-field test and sucrose preference test were used to evaluate behavioristics of the rats. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot methods were used to detect the expression levels of 5-HT3BR mRNA and protein in the rat hypothalamus. RESULTS: The expression of 5-HT3BR in hypothalamus of anger-in model rats increased obviously (P<0.01) and that of anger-out model rats decreased obviously (P<0.01) compared with the normal control group. Compared with the model group, the expressions of 5-HT3BR in the treatment groups were significantly improved (P<0.01) after treatment, and recovered to normal level. CONCLUSION: The anger-in stimulation obviously increases hypothalamic 5-HT3BR expression and the anger-out emotion can obviously reduce its expression. Chinese herbal medicines for regulating liver qi may treat anger emotion in rats by improving the hypothalamic 5-HT3BR protein and gene expression levels.
