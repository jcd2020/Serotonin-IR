Berry, S. A., et al. (1996). "Rapid agonist-induced internalization of the 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) receptor occurs via the endosome pathway in vitro." Molecular Pharmacology 50(2): 306-313.

	The mechanism by which agonists induce 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) (5-HT2A) receptor internalization was investigated in a clonal cell line stably transfected with the 5-HT2A receptor cDNA. Confocal laser microscopy of immunolabeled 5-HT2A receptors in control (untreated) cells demonstrated that most of the immunoreactivity was associated with the cell surface. After quipazine administration, a significant increase in intracellular immunofluorescence was measured. Time course studies demonstrated rapid agonist-dependent internalization of 5-HT2A receptors, with significant internalization occurring as early as 5 min after agonist administration at 37 degrees. In GF-62 cells, agonist-induced internalization was blocked by preincubation with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin. Internalization was also temperature sensitive because agonist-induced internalization did not occur at 4 degrees. Dual-label experiments disclosed that 5-HT2A and transferrin receptors were internalized via the same endocytotic vesicles. These results suggest that 5-HT2A receptors and transferrin receptors are internalized via the endosomal pathway in GF-62 cells. Although 5-HT2A receptors were internalized, down-regulation, or loss of radioligand binding sites, did not occur. Our results demonstrate that agonists rapidly induce 5-HT2A receptor internalization via the endosomal pathway and that internalization can be dissociated from down-regulation.
