Meltzer, H. Y. and M. Maes (1995). "Pindolol pretreatment blocks stimulation by meta-chlorophenylpiperazine of prolactin but not cortisol secretion in normal men." Psychiatry Res 58(2): 89-98.

	Previous reports from this laboratory have shown that pindolol, a partial serotonin1A receptor agonist, inhibited prolactin, but not cortisol secretion induced by administration of the serotonin (5-HT) precursor L-5-hydroxytryptophan or the direct-acting 5-HT2A/5HT2C receptor agonist MK-212. The findings suggest additive or interactive effects of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptors in modulating 5-HT-related prolactin, but not cortisol, responsivity. To examine further the role of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptors in prolactin and cortisol secretion in healthy men, the effects of meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a potent 5-HT receptor agonist, on the above hormones were studied in eight healthy men with and without pindolol pretreatment. It has previously been demonstrated that ketanserin, a 5-HT2A antagonist, and ritanserin, a 5-HT2A/5-HT2C antagonist, block the prolactin and attenuate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responses to mCPP in man or rodents. Administration of mCPP induced a significant increase in plasma concentrations of prolactin and cortisol. The mCPP-induced prolactin concentrations were significantly blocked by pretreatment with pindolol, whereas mCPP-stimulated cortisol levels were not diminished by pindolol pretreatment. Thus, mCPP-induced prolactin secretion appears to require the availability of both 5-HT2C and 5-HT1A receptor activation, since blockade of either of these receptors may diminish the mCPP-induced prolactin response. Cortisol secretion stimulated by mCPP may occur following 5-HT2C receptor stimulation in the presence of 5-HT1A receptor blockade.
