Wooten, D. W., et al. (2012). "Measurement of 5-HT1A receptor density and in-vivo binding parameters of F-18 mefway in the nonhuman primate." Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism 32(8): 1546-1558.

	The goal of this work was to characterize the in-vivo behavior of [F-18]mefway as a suitable positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for the assay of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor density (B-max). Six rhesus monkeys were studied using a multiple-injection (M-I) protocol consisting of three sequential bolus injections of [F-18]mefway. Injection times and amounts of unlabeled mefway were optimized for the precise measurement of B-max and specific binding parameters k(off) and k(on) for estimation of apparent K-D. The PET time series were acquired for 180 minutes with arterial sampling performed throughout. Compartmental analysis using the arterial input function was performed to obtain estimates for K-1, k(2), k(off), B-max, and K-Dapp in the cerebral cortex and raphe nuclei (RN) using a model that accounted for nontracer doses of mefway. Averaged over subjects, highest binding was seen in the mesial temporal and dorsal anterior cingulate cortices with B-max values of 42 +/- 8 and 36 +/- 8 pmol/mL, respectively, and lower values in the superior temporal cortex, RN, and parietal cortex of 24 +/- 4, 19 +/- 4, and 13 +/- 2 pmol/mL, respectively. The K-Dapp of mefway for the 5-HT1A receptor sites was 4.3 +/- 1.3 nmol/L. In conclusion, these results show that M-I [F-18]mefway PET experiments can be used for the in-vivo measurement of 5-HT1A receptor density.
