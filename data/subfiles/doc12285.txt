	DR4446 (1-methyl-2a-[4-(4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[3,2-c]pyridin-5-yl)butyl]-2a,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benz[cd]indole-2-one) is a potent 5-HT7 receptor antagonist (K-i = 9.7 nM) with a high selectivity over other 5-HT family receptors (K-i for 5-HT1A: 770 nM; for other 5-HT receptors: > 1000 nM).As a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for the 5-HT7 receptor, 7 [C-11]DR4446 was synthesized at high radiochemical purity (>98%) with specific activity of 73-120 GBq/mumol at the end of synthesis by the alkylation of the desmethyl precursor (1) with [C-11]CH3I in the presence of NaH. A PET study in monkey demonstrated that [C-11]DR4446 had good permeability into the brain, and had a specific binding component in the brain regions including the thalamus, possibly an area in the 5-HT7 receptors. Metabolite analysis showed that [C-11]DR4446 was relatively stable and low percentages of two radio-labeled metabolites were detected in the plasma of monkey using HPLC.
