Bolaños-Jiménez, F., et al. (1995). "Stress-induced 5-HT1A receptor desensitization: protective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761)." Fundam Clin Pharmacol 9(2): 169-174.

	The effects of sub-chronic cold stress on the functioning of hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors in old isolated rats and the possible protective effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) were investigated. Cold exposure during five days, produced a significant reduction of the inhibitory effect of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT) on forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. In contrast, neither the affinity nor the density of hippocampal [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding sites were affected indicating that the reduced sensitivity of 5-HT1A receptors induced by stress is probably due to a modification of their coupling mechanisms to adenylyl cyclase. The stress-induced desensitization of 5-HT1A receptors was prevented by the administration of EGb 761 (50 mg/kg per os/14 days). These results clearly indicate that 5-HT1A receptors are desensitized by stress and point out the reduced capacity of old rats to cope with the adverse effects of a chronic stressor. EGb 761 appears to restore the age-related decreased capacity to adapt to a chronic stressor.
