	1 Binding of the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist radioligand [H-3]-SB-269970 to human 5-HT7(a) receptors expressed in HEK293 cell membranes (h5-HT7(a)/293) and to guinea-pig cerebral cortex membranes, was characterized and compared with [H-3]-5-CT binding. 2 [H-3]-SB-269970 (1 nM) showed full association with h5-HT7(a)/293 membranes after 40 min. Specific binding at equilibrium represented >90% of total binding and was fully reversible by methiothepin (10 mu M), full dissociation occurring by 100 min. The association (k(+ 1)) and dissociation (k(-1)) rate constants were 0.05 nM(-1) min(-1) and 0.05 min(-1) respectively, giving a K-D (k(-1)/k(+1)) of 1.0 nM. 3 [H-3]-SB-269970 bound saturably and apparently monophasically to both h5-HT7(a)/293 and guinea-pig cortex membranes, with K-D values of 1.25+/-0.05 and 1.7+/-0.3 nM respectively. The B-max for [3H]-SB-269970 to both h5-HT7(a)/293 and guinea-pig cortex membranes (5780+/-380 and 125+/-8.2 fmoles mg protein(-1) respectively) was similar to that for [H-3]-5-CT (6190+/-940 and 143+19 fmoles mg protein(-1) respectively). These data suggest that, in each tissue, both radioligands labelled the same population of receptors, which appear to be present in an agonist high affinity state. 4 The profile of compound inhibition of [H-3]-SB-269970 binding to h5-HT7(a)/293 and guinea-pig cortex membranes correlated well (corr. coeff. 0.98) with those for [3H]-5-CT binding and were consistent with the profiles reported previously for the human 5-HT7(a) and guinea-pig cortex 5-HT7 receptors using [3H]-5-CT. Hill slopes for inhibition of [3H]-SB-269970 and [3H]-5-CT binding were close to.l, consistent with binding to a single receptor population in both tissues. 5 [H-3]-SB-269970 represents the first selective 5-HT7 antagonist radioligand, which should aid further characterization of 5-HT7 receptors in recombinant and native tissues and help establish their role in brain function.
