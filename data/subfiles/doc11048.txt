Roumy, M. and J. M. Zajac (1999). "Neuropeptide FF selectively attenuates the effects of nociceptin on acutely dissociated neurons of the rat dorsal raphe nucleus." Brain Res 845(2): 208-214.

	Intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) was measured in neurons, acutely dissociated from the rat dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), with the fluorescent calcium probe Fluo3. Nociceptin (300 nM) had no effect on resting [Ca2+](i) but reduced the magnitude of the [Ca2+](i) transient triggered by depolarization in 90% of neurons having polygonal or fusiform perikarya. In 94% of neurons with the same morphology 5-HT (30 mu M) also reduced the magnitude of the [Ca2+](i) transient. The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist 4-iodo-N-[2-[4(methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-benzamide hydrochloride (p-MPPI) (0.4 mu M) strongly attenuated (by 72 +/- 7%, n = 4) this effect. The responses to nociceptin and 5-HT were not affected by BaCl2 (100 mu M). The neuropeptide FF analog [D-Tyr(1), (N-Me)Phe(3)]NPFF (1DMe) altered neither the resting [Ca2+](i) nor the [Ca2+](i) transient triggered by depolarization but dose-dependently decreased the effect of nociceptin (EC50 = 1.8 nM, maximal reduction: 68 +/- 5%). 1DMe had no effect on the response to 5-HT. Another neuropeptide FF analog, exhibiting a different pharmacological activity in mice and rats, [D-Tyr(1), D-Leu(2), D-Phe(3)]NPFF (1 mu M) also reduced the effect of nociceptin by 74 +/- 11% (n = 4). Few neurons (5 out of 42), either with polygonal/fusiform or smaller ovoid cell bodies, responded to the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala(2), (N-Me)Phe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin (DAGO) with a decrease in the depolarization-induced [Ca2+](i) transient. 1DMe (100 nM) attenuated this response by 69 +/- 14%, These results suggest that, at the cellular level, neuropeptide FF selectively counteracts the effects of opioid receptor activation.
