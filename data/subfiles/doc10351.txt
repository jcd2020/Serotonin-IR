Pranzatelli, M. R. and P. Razi (1994). "DRUG-INDUCED REGULATION OF I-125 IODOCYANOPINDOLOL-LABELED 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(1B) RECEPTOR-BINDING SITES IN THE CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM." Neuropsychopharmacology 10(4): 259-264.

	Little is known about the regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) (5-HT1B) receptors, a putative terminal autoreceptor in the central nervous system. We studied the regional responses of [I-125]iodocyanopindolol ([I-125]ICYP)-labeled central 5-HT1B sites to chronic treatment with S-HT agonists and antagonists at a dose of 10 mg/kg/d IP for 30 consecutive days in the rat. In controls, there were 3.4-fold regional differences in B-max, with a rank order of brainstem > hippocampus > cortex, striatum > spinal cord, and K(a)s were slightly lower in striatum and spinal cord. RU 24969 significantly reduced B-max 23 to 63% in cortex, hippocampus, striatum, brainstem, and spinal cord without a change in K-a except for a 1.7-fold increase in cortex and spinal cord. The putative 5-H-1B agonist (m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP), but not [1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine] (m-CPP) or the 5-HT1B antagonists pindolol or quipazine, reduced the B-max of cortical 5-HT1B sites (-16%). Chronic treatment with the 5-HT antagonists methysergide, pindolol, propranolol, ritanserin, metergoline, or methiothepin did not significantly affect striatal B-max or K-d compared to respective vehicles. The data demonstrate significant changes in maximum number of 5-HT1B receptors in response to chronic agonist but not antagonist treatments at the dose studied.
