Blokland, A., et al. (2005). "Evaluation of DOI, 8-OH-DPAT, eticlopride and amphetamine on impulsive responding in a reaction time task in rats." Behav Pharmacol 16(2): 93-100.

	We examined the effects of DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine), 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(N,N-dipropylamino)tetralin, eticlopride and amphetamine in a reaction time (RT) task. In this task a trial is initiated after a rat pushes a panel. Rats have to wait (0.5-1.5 s) until a tone is presented before making a response. The number of premature responses, releasing the panel before tone was switched on, was taken as a measure of motor impulsivity. A group of 10 Lewis rats was tested in the RT task after treatment with different doses of drugs which have been shown previously to affect impulsive responding: DOI (0.1, 0.2 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (0.1, 0.3 mg/kg), eticlopride (0.01, 0.03 mg/kg) and D-amphetamine (0.3, 1 mg/kg). A progressive ratio test was used to control for drug effects on food motivation. DOI (0.1 mg/kg) and D-amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg) increased impulsive responding in the RT task. Conversely, 8-OH-DPAT decreased impulsive responding in the RT task. These effects of DOI, D-amphetamine and 8-OH-DPAT on impulsive responding were not associated with changes in food motivation, as assessed by performance in the progressive ratio task. Eticlopride did not affect impulsive responding. The present data suggest that 5-HT2A receptors and dopamine (but not D2 receptors) are associated with motor impulsivity.
