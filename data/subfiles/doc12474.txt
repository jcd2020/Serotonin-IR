Tanaka-Gomi, N., et al. (2007). "Postnatal changes in 5HT and NK1 receptors in rat trigeminal motor nucleus and surroundings." Int J Dev Neurosci 25(7): 427-432.

	Our previous study showed that developmental changes to serotonin and substance P coexist in the trigeminal motor nucleus (Vmo), dorsolateral subnucleus (Vmo.dl), ventromedial subnucleus (Vmo.vm) and the area within 300 microm surrounding Vmo (SVmo). This occurred in rats from embryonic day (E)19 to postnatal day (P)70, with density of these terminals peaking at P7 in these three areas. The present study examined postnatal development of serotonergic 1A receptor (5HT1A receptor) and substance P receptor (NK1 receptor) expression in Vmo and SVmo in rats from E19 to P70. No significant changes in percentages of 5HT1A and NK1 receptor-expressing cells were seen between E19 and P70 by immunohistochemical study or in situ hybridization. In a real-time PCR study, quantities of 5HT1A and NK1 receptor expression peaked at P7, indicating that expression of these receptors was maximized in each neuronal cell body in the Vmo and SVmo at P7. This result corresponds with postnatal changes in serotonin/substance P-coexisting terminals found in our previous study. Furthermore, 5HT1A and NK1 receptors displayed very similar patterns of expression, which may support the hypothesis that potentiation of serotonin and substance P are involved in excitability regulating trigeminal motor functions, including mastication and breathing.
