	Properties of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced current (I5-HT) were examined in neurons of rat dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) by using whole cell patch-clamp techniques. I5-HT was associated with an increase in the membrane conductance of DLSN neurons. The reversal potential of I5-HT was -93 +/- 6 (SE) mV (n = 7) in the artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) and was changed by 54 mV per decade change in the external K+ concentration, indicating that I5-HT is carried exclusively by K+. Voltage dependency of the K+ conductance underlying I5-HT was investigated by using current-voltage relationship. I5-HT showed a linear I-V relation in 63%, inward rectification in 21%, and outward rectification in 16% of DLSN neurons. (+/-)-8-Hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide (30 muM), a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, also produced outward currents with three types of voltage dependency. Ba2+ (100 muM) blocked the inward rectifier I5-HT but not the outward rectifier I5-HT. In I5-HT with linear I-V relation, blockade of the inward rectifier K+ current by Ba2+ (100 muM) unmasked the outward rectifier current in DLSN neurons. These results suggest that I5-HT with linear I-V relation is the sum of inward rectifier and outward rectifier K+ currents in DLSN neurons. Intracellular application of guanosine-5'-O-( 3-thiotriphosphate) (300 muM) and guanosine-5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (5 mM), blockers of G protein, irreversibly depressed I5-HT. Protein kinase C (PKC) 19-36 (20 muM), a specific PKC inhibitor, depressed the outward rectifier I5-HT but not the inward rectifier I5-HT. I5-HT was depressed by N-ethylmaleimide, which uncouples the G-protein-coupled receptor from pertussis-toxin-sensitive G proteins. H-89 (10 muM) and adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphothioate Rp-isomer (300 mM), protein kinase A inhibitors, did not depress I5- HT. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10 muM), an activator of PKC, produced an outward rectifying K+ current. These results suggest that both 5-HT-induced inward and outward rectifying currents are mediated by a G protein and that PKC is probably involved in the transduction pathway of the outward rectifying I5-HT in DLSN neurons.
