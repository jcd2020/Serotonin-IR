Harms, A., et al. (2003). "Synthesis and 5-HT2A radioligand receptor binding assays of DOMCI and DOMOM, two novel 5-HT2A receptor ligands." Arch Pharm (Weinheim) 336(3): 155-158.

	A synthesis of two new active substances, DOMCl (1-(4-chloromethyl-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-propanamine; 2) and DOMOM (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methoxymethyl-phenyl)-2-propanamine; 3), was developed. Unexpectedly, the Blanc reaction permitted successful synthesis of 2,5-dimethoxyphenylpropylamine derivatives having a substituted methyl group in position 4 since solvation of the reactant occurs during the reaction. Afterwards, their affinities towards the 5-HT2A receptor were examined in 5-HT2A radioligand receptor binding assays. The study of these substances is of considerable interest because they were predicted, by preliminary molecular modeling studies based on mescalin units, to be potential new hallucinogens that should be added to the list of substances prohibited by law. It was assumed that DOMCl would be 82 times more potent as a hallucinogen than mescalin, and DOMOM would be 94 times more potent. The 5-HT2A radioligand receptor binding studies showed that the affinities of DOMCl and DOMOM for the 5-HT2A receptor are less than expected but are nevertheless 1.6 and 8.7 times higher, respectively, than that of mescalin. Therefore, scheduling these substances as potential drugs of abuse might be considered.
