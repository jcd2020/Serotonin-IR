	Locomotion can be induced in rodents by direct application 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) onto the spinal cord. Previous studies suggest important roles for 5-HT7 and 5- HT2A receptors in the locomotor effects of 5-HT. Here we show for the first time that activation of a discrete population of 5-HT neurons in the rodent brain stem produces locomotion and that the evoked locomotion requires 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptors. Cells localized in the parapyramidal region (PPR) of the mid-medulla produced locomotor-like activity as a result of either electrical or chemical stimulation, and PPR-evoked locomotor-like activity was blocked by antagonists to 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 receptors located on separate populations of neurons concentrated in different rostro-caudal regions. 5-HT7 receptor antagonists blocked locomotor-like activity when applied above the L-3 segment; 5- HT2A receptor antagonists blocked locomotor-like activity only when applied below the L-2 segment. 5-HT7 receptor antagonists decreased step cycle duration, consistent with an action on neurons involved in the rhythm-generating function of the central pattern generator (CPG) for locomotion. 5-HT2A antagonists reduced the amplitude of ventral root activity with only small effects on step cycle duration, suggesting an action directly on cells involved in the output stage of the pattern generator for locomotion, including motoneurons and premotor cells. Experiments with selective antagonists show that dopaminergic (D-1, D-2) and noradrenergic (alpha(1), alpha(2)) receptors are not critical for PPR-evoked locomotor-like activity.
