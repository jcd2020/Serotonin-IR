Yan, Q. S., et al. (2000). "Enhanced accumbal dopamine release following 5-HT2A receptor stimulation in rats pretreated with intermittent cocaine." Brain Research 863(1-2): 254-258.

	This study was conducted to determine whether dopamine (DA) release in the nucleus accumbens (NACC) following 5-HT2A receptor stimulation is potentiated by intermittent cocaine. Rats received daily injections of either saline or cocaine (30 mg/kg, s.c.) for 14 days. At the 7th day after withdrawal, microdialysis was performed in the NACC. Infusion of (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI, 50 mu M), a 5-HT2 receptor agonist, into the NACC produced greater and longer-lasting increases in extracellular DA in the rats pretreated with cocaine than in the rats pretreated with saline. The DOI-induced increases in NACC DA were attenuated by co-perfusion with ketanserin (50 mu M), a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. The results are consistent with the concept that intermittent cocaine may cause enhanced sensitivity of 5-HT2A receptors within the NACC. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
