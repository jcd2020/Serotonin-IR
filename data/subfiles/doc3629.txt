Fedotova Iu, O., et al. (2012). "[Involvement of some subtypes of 5-HT2-receptors in affective behavior in female rats]." Fiziol Zh 58(6): 75-80.

	The present work was devoted to the comparative analysis of influence of chronic administration of 5-HT(2B/2C) receptors agonist - m-CPP (0,5 mg/kg, i.p.) and 5-HT(2A/2C) receptors antagonist - ketanserine (0,1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14 days on the anxiety and depressive-like behavior in adult female rats. It was established that chronic ketanserine administration rendered antidepressive and anxiolytic effects in females during estrous and proestrous. M-CPP administration also resulted in antidepressive effect in estrous and proestrous. Also, it was noted definite modulation of anxiety behavior in connection of ovary cycle phases in rats treated with m-CPP: at increased level of estrogens was anxiolytic effect while at reduced level of estrogen - anxiogenic effect. It is suggested the involvement of different subtypes of 5-HT receptors in the mechanisms of anxiety-depressive-like behavior at alterations of hormonal balance during ovary cycle. The data obtained indicate a close interaction between the ovary hormonal and serotonergic systems of the brain in the mechanisms of anxiety and depression.
