	The present study was designed to examine the neurochemical effects of (+/-)-mirtazapine (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) and its enantiomers in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received either (+)-mirtazapine, (-)-mirtazapine, (+/-)-mirtazapine or vehicle, by intraperitoneal injection for two weeks. Maximum change in temperature from baseline, following a single dose of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (0.15 mg kg(-1) s.c.), was used to assess the function of the 5-HT1A receptors. Chronic drug treatment potentiated this response, with (+/-)-mirtazapine > (-)-mirtazapine > (+)-mirtazapine. Receptor changes were also observed with a slight decrease in beta(1)-adrenoceptor density, although this failed to reach significance. A significant decrease in beta(1)-adrenoceptor affinity was observed following (-)-mirtazapine treatment. All drugs tested significantly reduced the density of the 5-HT2 receptors. Results of the present study suggest that in so far as alterations in these receptor populations are important for the therapeutic action of antidepressants, neither of the enantiomers appear to be more active than the racemic mixture.
