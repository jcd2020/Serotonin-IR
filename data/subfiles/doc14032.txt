	In this study, we examined the response of spontaneously active as well as quiescent cells (L-glutamate-activated) in the rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFc) to the iontophoresis of 2-methylserotonin (2-Me-5-HT, 5-HT3 receptor agonist), (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-(4-iodo-phenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI, 5-HT2A,2C receptor agonist), 8-hydroxy-N,N-di-propylamino tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT1A receptor agonist) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, a non-selective GABA receptor agonist) after the intracerebral administration of pertussis toxin, an inactivator of the Gi/o protein. This was accomplished using the techniques of extracellular single cell recording and iontophoresis. The administration of pertussis toxin (0.5 microgram, 24 hours before the experiment) into the mPFc did not alter the response of mPFc cells to the iontophoresis of DOI, 2-Me-5HT or GABA compared to saline treated controls. However, the response of mPFc cells to the iontophoresis of 8-OH-DPAT was significantly attenuated in the animals pretreated with pertussis toxin compared to controls. These results suggest that the 5-HT1A but not 5-HT2A,2C or 5-HT3 receptor is coupled to the Gi/o protein.
