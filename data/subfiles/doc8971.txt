Popova, N. K., et al. (2010). "Functional characteristics of serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in the brain and the expression of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor genes in aggressive and non-aggressive rats." Neurosci Behav Physiol 40(4): 357-361.

	The functional activity of serotonin 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors and the expression of the genes encoding them were studied in Norway rats bred for 60 generations for the presence and absence of high levels of stress-evoked aggression to humans. There were no significant differences in the levels of 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA in the midbrain, frontal cortex, and hippocampus and the extents of head twitching evoked by the 5-HT(2A) agonist DOI in rats with and without genetically determined high levels of aggression. Administration of the selective 5-HT(2C) agonist MK-212 weakened reflex startle in response to an acoustic signal (the acoustic startle response) in non-aggressive animals but had no significant effects on the response in aggressive animals. Increases in the level of 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNA were seen in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in non-aggressive rats as compared with aggressive animals. Increases in the expression of the 5-HT(2C) receptor gene and the functional state of 5-HT(2C) receptors were seen in the brains of non-aggressive rats, without any changes in the 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA level or receptor sensitivity; this is evidence for the involvement of 5-HT(2C) receptors in the mechanisms inhibiting fear-evoked aggressive behavior.
