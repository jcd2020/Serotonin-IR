	Quantitative autoradiography was used to examine possible adaptive changes in serotonin 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT2A/2C receptor binding sites in adult rat basal ganglia, after partial or severe lesions of serotonergic neurons produced by intraraphe injections of variable amounts of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. In controls, the 5-HT1B/1D sites labeled with S-CM-G[125I]TNH2 were evenly distributed in the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens. The density of 5-HT1B/1D sites was higher in the ventral than dorsal part of the striatum and no regional differences were detected along the rostrocaudal axis of the structure. The 5-HT2A/2C sites labeled with [125I]DOI were preferentially distributed in the mediodorsal striatum and higher densities were detected in the shell than core of the nucleus accumbens. Following 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine injections, there were no changes in binding of either receptor subtype after partial lesions entailing 80-90% 5-HT depletions. After severe 5-HT depletions (over 95%), large increases in 5-HT1B/1D binding were observed in the substantia nigra (78%), but no changes took place in the globus pallidus. Increases in 5-HT1B/1D binding were also detected in the shell of the nucleus accumbens (27%). Similar sized increases in 5-HT2A/2C binding (22%) were restricted to the medial striatum. The present results suggest a preferential association between 5-HT1B/1D receptors and the striatonigral neurons containing substance P, as indicated by the striatal distribution of these receptors and their selective increases in the substantia nigra after severe 5-HT deprivation. We recently proposed a similar relationship between the 5-HT4 receptors and the striatopallidal neurons containing met-enkephalin. Moreover, the increases in 5-HT1B/1D binding in the substantia nigra and in the shell of the nucleus accumbens reinforce the view of an implication of this receptor subtype in motor functions. In contrast, the prominent increases in 5-HT2A/2C binding after severe 5-HT deprivation as restricted to the medial region of the striatum and suggest up-regulation of most probably 5-HT2C receptors in a region implicated in cognitive functions.
