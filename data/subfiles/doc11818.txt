	The ring-closed phenylethylamine analogue 6-hydroxy-3-n-propyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (1) is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist of moderate potency, according to both in vivo biochemical data and in vitro binding data. The active compounds of this series also induce the 5-HT behavioral syndrome. Molecular modeling studies were performed with molecular mechanics calculations, and a tentative explanation for the relatively low potency of these serotonergic benzazepines is provided.
