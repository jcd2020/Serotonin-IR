Fu, X., et al. (2002). "Synthesis, receptor potency, and selectivity of halogenated diphenylpiperidines as serotonin 5-HT2A ligands for PET or SPECT brain imaging." J Med Chem 45(11): 2319-2324.

	A series of 4'-substituted phenyl-4-piperidinylmethanol and benzoyl-4-piperidine derivatives was synthesized as potential novel serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligands that can be radiolabeled for in vivo brain imaging. Compounds were prepared by alkylation of 4-substituted benzoyl-4-piperidine with an iodo- or fluoro-substituted phenylalkyl halide followed by reduction with sodium borohydride. Potency of novel compounds was determined by in vitro radioreceptor affinity assays selective for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Potent compounds were further evaluated for selectivity at serotonin-2A versus 2C, 6, and 7, as well as dopamine D2 and adrenergic alpha1 and alpha2 receptors. The novel compound (4-fluorophenyl)-(1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]piperidin-4-yl])methanol was particularly promising with high 5-HT2A potency (K(i) = 1.63 nM) and >300-fold selectivity over other 5-HT receptor types.
