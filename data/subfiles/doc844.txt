Berendsen, H. H., et al. (1991). "Depletion of brain serotonin differently affects behaviors induced by 5HT1A, 5HT1C, and 5HT2 receptor activation in rats." Behav Neural Biol 55(2): 214-226.

	5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)-depleted rats were subjected to behavioral experiments in which the response to activation of 5HT1A, 5HT1c, and 5HT2 receptor subtypes was measured. Depletion of 5HT was produced by unilateral intracerebroventricular injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (100 micrograms/rat) or by systemic injection of p-chlorophenylalanine (150 mg/kg injected intraperitoneally 72, 48, and 24 h before the test). The dose-response curve of the 5HT1A-mediated, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (0.022-0.46 mg/kg)-induced lower lip retraction was not changed after depletion, nor was the dose-response curve of the 5HT2 receptor-mediated (+-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (0.046-1.0 mg/kg)-induced head shake response. The dose-response curve for penile erections, a 5HT1c receptor-mediated response after mCPP (0.1-1.0 mg/kg), a direct 5HT1c agonist, is shifted to the left after 5HT depletion, whereas the response to indirect activation of the 5HT1c receptor with the 5HT reuptake inhibitors citalopram (2.2-4.6 mg/kg) and paroxetine (0.22-2.2 mg/kg) was inhibited after 5HT depletion. These results suggest that 5HT1c receptors are more subject to denervation supersensitivity than 5HT1A and 5HT2 receptors. This lesion model may be useful to discriminate behaviorally between direct and indirect activation of the 5HT1c receptor.
