Schmuck, K., et al. (1994). "Cloning and functional characterization of the human 5-HT2B serotonin receptor." FEBS Lett 342(1): 85-90.

	Recently, we have reported the cloning of the rat 5-HT2B receptor cDNA. This receptor is particularly interesting since it may be involved in diseases such as migraine. Here, we describe the isolation of a human 5-HT2B receptor clone from a cDNA library derived from SH-SY5Y cells. Although the receptor sequence was only 80% homologous to the rat sequence, the exon-intron distribution was conserved between the two species. In the human body, the receptor mRNA was detected in most peripheral organs. Only low expression levels were found in the brain. After expression in HEK 293 cells, activation of the receptor stimulated the production of phosphatidylinositol. The pharmacology of this functional response correlated well with that of the rodent receptor.
