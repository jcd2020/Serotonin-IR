	NESP55, a novel member of the chromogranins, was originally implicated as a precursor of a peptide LSAL with 5-HT1B receptor antagonist activity. In humans, NESP55 (MIM 139320) is encoded by an alternative transcript of GNAS1, the gene encoding the guanine nucleotide-binding alpha subunit of G(s). As a results of the potential relevance of NESP55 to serotoninergic neurotransmission, we screened its sequence using genomic DNA pools from autistic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) probands and control subjects. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified and the allele frequencies of those SNPs were determined. In addition, a 24-bp in-frame deletion in the coding region was found in one of the OCD probands. To further investigate its pattern of inheritance and the relevance to studied phenotypes, we genotyped 123 total subjects from autism, OCD and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) families. The deletion was detected only in one OCD family and followed Mendelian inheritance. All subjects with the deletion were heterozygous. However, there are no specific behavioural or physical alterations in the subjects with this deletion variant. The physiological role of NESP55 in serotoninergic neurotransmission as well as the effect of the deletion on its function should be evaluated in future studies. (C) 2000 Academic Press.
