	In addition to the amyloidogenic pathway, amyloid precursor protein (APP) can be cleaved by alpha-secretases, producing soluble and neuroprotective APP alpha (sAPPalpha) (nonamyloidogenic pathway) and thus preventing the generation of pathogenic amyloid-beta. However, the mechanisms regulating APP cleavage by alpha-secretases remain poorly understood. Here, we showed that expression of serotonin type 4 receptors (5-HT(4)Rs) constitutively (without agonist stimulation) induced APP cleavage by the alpha-secretase ADAM10 and the release of neuroprotective sAPPalpha in HEK-293 cells and cortical neurons. This effect was independent of cAMP production. Interestingly, we demonstrated that 5-HT(4) receptors physically interacted with the mature form of ADAM10. Stimulation of 5-HT(4) receptors by an agonist further increased sAPPalpha secretion, and this effect was mediated by cAMP/Epac signaling. These findings describe a new mechanism whereby a GPCR constitutively stimulates the cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase and promotes the nonamyloidogenic pathway of APP processing.
