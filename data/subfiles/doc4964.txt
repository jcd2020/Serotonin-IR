Ieni, J. R. and L. R. Meyerson (1988). "The 5-HT1A receptor probe [3H]8-OH-DPAT labels the 5-HT transporter in human platelets." Life Sci 42(3): 311-320.

	The present study characterizes a serotonin (5-HT) binding site on human platelet membranes, using [3H]8-OH-DPAT as the radioligand. [3H]8-OH-DPAT binds specifically and saturably to a site on human platelet membranes with an average KD of 43 nM and Bmax of 1078 fmol/mg protein. Determinations of IC50 values for various serotonergic characterizing agents in platelets for displacement of [3H]8-OH-DPAT were performed. For example, 8-OH-DPAT 5HT1A had an IC50 of 117 nM; TFMPP 5HT1B (2.3 microM0 and PAPP 1A + 5HT2 (9 microM); ipsapirone 5HT1A (21.1 microM) and buspirone 5HT1A (greater than 100 microM); ketanserin 5HT2 (greater than 100 microM); 5-HT uptake inhibitors: paroxetine (13 nM); chlorimipramine (73 nM) and fluoxetine (653 nM). The pharmacological inhibitory profile of the platelet 8-OH-DPAT site is not consistent with profiles reported for brain. 8-OH-DPAT does not inhibit [3H]imipramine binding, however, it does inhibit [3H]5-HT uptake in human platelets near 5-HT's Km value (IC50 = 2-4 microM). These results suggest that the human platelet site labeled by [3H]8-OH-DPAT is pharmacologically different from the neuronal site and probably is a component of the 5-HT transporter.
