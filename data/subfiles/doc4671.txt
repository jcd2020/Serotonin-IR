Hirvonen, J., et al. (2007). "Measurement of serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding using positron emission tomography and carbonyl-C-11 WAY-100635 - considerations on the validity of cerebellum as a reference region." Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism 27(1): 185-195.

	Carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 has been used extensively in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT1A) in vivo in the human brain. Specific binding to receptors is usually estimated using compartmental modeling with arterial plasma input function. The use of reference tissue input (cerebellum) enables quantification without the need of arterial blood sampling, but the accuracy of this method is highly dependent on the validity of the reference region in terms of both specific and nonspecific binding. In this paper, we report exceptionally high uptake of [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 in the gray matter of cerebellum in one healthy male subject, which was reproducible in repeated PET scanning and most likely represents specific binding to 5-HT1A receptors in cerebellar gray matter. Serotonin 1A receptors are transiently expressed in the human cerebellum during early childhood and usually level off until adolescence but may persist in some individuals. As a methodological implication, the results of this study with regard to test-retest characteristics of [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 measurements in healthy volunteers using both arterial plasma and reference tissue input functions support the use of cerebellar white matter as reference region, to avoid the potential bias originating from binding of [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 to 5-HT1A receptors in cerebellar gray matter.
