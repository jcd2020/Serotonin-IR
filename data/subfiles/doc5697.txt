Kitamura, Y., et al. (2007). "The 5-HT1A receptor full agonist, 8-OH-DPAT inhibits ACTH-induced 5-HT2A receptor hyperfunction in rats: involvement of 5-HT1A receptors in the DOI-induced wet-dog shakes in ACTH-treated rats." Biol Pharm Bull 30(1): 117-120.

	We examined the influence of 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor full agonist, on the wet-dog shake response induced by the (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), a 5-HT2A receptor agonist, in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated rats. Chronic ACTH (100 microg/rat, s.c.) treatment for 14 d increased the wet-dog shake response induced DOI. The 8-OH-DPAT inhibited the wet-dog shake response induced by DOI in rats with ACTH for 14 d. On the other hand, the 8-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia and flat body posture were inhibited when ACTH was administered for 14 d. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with ACTH decreased the sensitivity of the 5-HT1A receptor system; however, the inhibitory effects from the 5-HT1A receptors to the 5-HT2A receptor system is not inhibited in ACTH-treated rats.
