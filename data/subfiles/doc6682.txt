	Rationale Several lines of evidence suggest inter-dependency between the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and the 5HT(1A) receptor, two recognised targets for the treatment of anxiety and depression. Objectives to examine the correlation of regional expression levels for these two serotonergic markers in the human brain in vivo. Methods Twelve male control subjects were examined with PET twice on the same day, using the radioligands [C-11]WAY 100635 and [C-11]MADAM for quantification of the 5-HT1A receptor and the 5-HTT, respectively. The binding potential (BP) was calculated for raphe nuclei, hippocampus and frontal cortex. Results In all regions, the BP for both [C-11]WAY 100635 (raphe nuclei 1.85-4.71, hippocampus 2.52-6.17, frontal cortex 2.03-3.79) and [C-11]MADAM (2.70-7.65, 0.47-1.76, 0.18-0.51) varied several fold between subjects. In the raphe nuclei, where the two markers are situated on the same neurons, the ratio of [C-11]WAY 100635 binding to [C-11]MADAM BP binding varied considerably (0.43-1.05). There was a positive correlation between the two markers in the raphe nuclei (r (xy)=0.68, p < 0.05) and in the hippocampus (r (xy)=0.97, < 0.001) but not in the frontal cortex (r (xy)=-0.25, p=0.44). Conclusions The results support a correlation between density levels of the 5-HT1A-receptor and the 5-HTT in the raphe nuclei and hippocampus but not in the frontal cortex. A suggested clinical implication is that the inter-individual variability in 5-HT1A-receptor and 5-HTT densities, as well as the ratio of these, is of particular interest in relation to individual responses to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment.
