Klein, A. K., et al. (2019). "Activation of 5-HT1B receptors in the Lateral Habenula attenuates the anxiogenic effects of cocaine." Behav Brain Res 357-358: 1-8.

	Recent work has implicated the Lateral Habenula (LHb) in the production of anxiogenic and aversive states. It is innervated by all the major monoamine neurotransmitter systems and has projections that have been shown to modulate the activity of both dopaminergic and serotonergic brain regions. Cocaine is a stimulant drug of abuse that potentiates neurotransmission in these monoamine systems and recent research suggests that the drug's behavioral effects may be related in part to its actions within the LHb. The present research was therefore devised to test the hypothesis that alterations in serotonin (5-HT) function within the LHb can affect the behavioral response to cocaine. Male rats were fitted with intracranial guide cannula and trained to traverse a straight alleyway once a day for a 1mg/kg i.v. injection of cocaine. Intra-LHb pretreatment with the 5-HT1B agonist CP 94,253 (0, 0.1, or 0.25mug/side) attenuated the development of approach/avoidance "retreat" behaviors known to be a consequence of cocaine's dual rewarding (approach) and anxiogenic (avoidance) properties. This effect was reversed by co-administration of a selective 5-HT1B antagonist, NAS-181 (0.1mug/side), demonstrating drug specificity at the 5-HT1B receptor. These data suggest that 5-HT1B signaling within the LHb contributes to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine.
