	5-HT7 receptor mRNA and protein are localised in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) on non-serotonergic neurones. The effect of 5-HT7 receptor antagonism on 5-HT efflux was measured from guinea-pig DRN slices, using the technique of fast cyclic voltammetry. The 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, SB-269970-A, significantly inhibited 5-HT efflux. The GABA(A) receptor agonist, muscimol, significantly inhibited 5-HT efflux, to a similar degree as SB-269970-A. In contrast, the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline, significantly increased 5-HT efflux and attenuated the muscimol-induced inhibition. The muscimol and SB-269970-A effects were not additive and in the presence of bicuculline the SB-269970-A-induced inhibition of 5-HT efflux was attenuated. These data suggest that 5-HT7 receptor antagonist-induced inhibition of 5-HT efflux occurs indirectly via activation of GABA(A) receptors. That is, 5-HT7 receptors may be located on GABA interneurones and when activated decrease GABA release and hence decrease the inhibitory tone on 5-HT neurones, increasing 5-HT efflux in the DRN. Therefore, in the presence of GABAergic tone 5-HT7 receptor antagonists would decrease 5-HT release from the DRN. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
