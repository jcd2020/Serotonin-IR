Nomura, K., et al. (1994). "A mechanism of 5-HT3 receptor mediation is involved etiologically in the psychological stress lesion the stomach of the mouse." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 271(1): 100-106.

	The role of brain amines, possibly involved in psychological stress, was evaluated and we postulate that the 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT3 receptors in the central nervous system are involved in the gastric lesion formation by psychological stress. The stress was in a communication box paradigm, in which each nonshocked mouse (responder) was placed in a Plexiglas compartment adjacent to mice receiving electrical shocks (sender). The responder mice revealed rather depressed gastric secretion, but developed gastric lesions which are significantly attenuated by pretreatment of dl-p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester:HCl (PCPA; 200-400 mg/kg p.o.), but not 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OH-DA; 60 micrograms/body i.c.v. or 80 mg/kg i.p. 1 hr after a 20-mg/kg i.p. dose of desipramine). Oral treatment with GR38032F (0.01-1 mg/kg), ICS205-930 (0.01-20 mg/kg), MDL72222 (0.01-1 mg/kg), metoclopramide (0.1-100 mg/kg), ketanserin (0.01-10 mg/kg) and sulpiride (32-320 mg/kg) dose-dependently attenuated the psychological stress lesion formation, and the activity was arranged in the order of their in vitro binding affinities for the 5-HT3, but not 5-HT1A or 5-HT2 receptors. In contrast, a peripherally acting 5-HT3 antagonist, M-840 ([[3-(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5- yl]-methyl]trimethyl-ammonium iodide), dopamine acting compounds, haloperidol and FR64822 [N-(4-pyridylcarbamoyl)amino-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine), and antisecretory drugs, atropine and famotidine, minimally affected the lesion formation.
