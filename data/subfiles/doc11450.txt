	In the course of a search for small-molecule inhibitors of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors we have identified a novel ergoline derivative (1) from the fungal culture of Dicyma sp. This compound has a pK(i) of 10.2 versus the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptor subtype. The structure was elucidated by extensive NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry.
