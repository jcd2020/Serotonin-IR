Tazi, A., et al. (1992). "POTENTIATION OF BEHAVIORAL-EFFECTS OF A CALCIUM-CHANNEL ANTAGONIST, NIFEDIPINE, BY IPSAPIRONE." Behavioural Pharmacology 3(3): 269-273.

	The synergistic effect between the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone and the calcium channel antagonist, nifedipine, was studied in animal models of anxiety and depression. Ipsapirone (1.5, 3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg) dose dependently potentiated the behavioural effects of a small and ineffective dose of nifedipine (2.0 mg/kg) in the two experimental paradigms. This potentiation was revealed by a decrease in immobilisation time in the forced swim test (antidepressant-like effect) and by an increase in water-consumption in a novel environment (anxiolytic-like effect). The data obtained are discussed in terms of the neurochemical effects of ipsapirone on the serotonergic system, and the possible interaction between nifedipine and this system.
