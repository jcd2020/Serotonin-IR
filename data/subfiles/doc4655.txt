Gue, M., et al. (1994). "CENTRAL CCK-8S RECEPTORS TRIGGER THE SIGMA LIGAND-INDUCED AND 5-HT(1A) AGONISTS-INDUCED ACCELERATION OF POSTPRANDIAL COLONIC TRANSIT IN RATS." Neurogastroenterology and Motility 6(1): 29-35.

	The effects of igmesine (JO 1784) and 5-HT1A agonists (8-OH-DPAT, buspirone) on post-prandial colonic transit were evaluated in conscious rats chronically fitted with an intracolonic catheter inserted into the proximal colon. Colonic transit time was evaluated by intracolonic administration of a radiolabelled marker ([Cr-51]sodium chromate) and collection of the faeces, per hour, on a conveyor belt. In control studies, the colonic mean retention time was 7.8 +/- 1.9 h and faecal dry matter was 50.1 +/- 8.4%. Intraperitoneal treatment with igmesine (1 mg kg-1) reduced the colonic mean retention time by 61.1%, but was inactive at 0.1 and 0.25 mg kg-1. Buspirone (10 mg kg-1 IP) and 8-OH-DPAT(0.1 mg kg-1) injected i.p. reduced the mean retention time. The stimulatory effect of buspirone on colonic transit was dose-related (0.1-10 mg kg-1). Neither igmesine, buspirone nor 8-OH-DPAT affected the faecal dry matter. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of igmesine (0.025 and 0.1 mg kg-1) also reduced the post-prandial mean retention time by 41.6 and 41.7%, respectively, without any effect on faecal dry matter. In contrast, intracerebroventricular injection of 8-OH-DPAT or buspirone had no effect on colonic mean retention time. Subcutaneous injection with BMY 14802 (1 mg kg-1) completely prevented the igmesine- (0.1 mg kg-1 i.c.v.) induced reduction of mean retention time; furthermore, spiroxatrine (0.5 mg kg-1 s.c.) blocked both buspirone- (10 mg kg-1 i.p.) and 8-OH-DPAT- (0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.) induced stimulation of post-prandial colonic transit. Intracerebroventricular but not i.p. injection of devazepide (10 mug kg-1) inhibited the stimulating effect of igmesine, 8-OH-DPAT or buspirone on colonic transit, while L365,260 was inactive. In rats igmesine and 5-HT1A agonists stimulate colonic transit by a mechanism involving the central release of CCK-8s and/or the activation of supraspinal CCKergic pathways and these effects are mediated through CCK(A)-type receptors.
