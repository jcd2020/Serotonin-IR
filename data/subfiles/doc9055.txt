Prinssen, E. P. M., et al. (2000). "Effects of WAY 100635 on antipsychotic-induced catalepsy in 5-HT depleted animals: a role for tonic activation of 5-HT1A receptors." European Journal of Pharmacology 395(2): 143-147.

	We recently observed that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)-cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY 100635) enhanced antipsychotic-induced catalepsy, which we hypothesized to be due to a blockade of tonic 5-HT1A receptor activation. Here, we examined this hypothesis by studying the effects of WAY 100635 in animals that were depleted of 5-HT by repeated treatment with the 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine methyl ester. Depletion of 5-HT abolished the enhancement by WAY 100635 of catalepsy induced by low doses of the antipsychotics nemonapride and raclopride, in agreement with the hypothesis that WAY 100635 enhances catalepsy by blocking tonic 5-HT1A receptor activation. Given the predictive validity of catalepsy, these findings indicate that 5-HT1A receptor blockade may enhance the extrapyramidal side-effects of antipsychotics in humans.
