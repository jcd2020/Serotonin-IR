Endo, T., et al. (1992). "VAGOTOMY AND ONDANSETRON (5-HT3 ANTAGONIST) INHIBITED THE INCREASE OF SEROTONIN CONCENTRATION INDUCED BY CYTOTOXIC DRUGS IN THE AREA POSTREMA OF FERRETS." Biogenic Amines 9(3): 163-175.

	The area postrema which lies on the wall of the forth ventricle at the level of the obex is a major neural component of the emetic reflex. In order to clarify the mechanism of cytotoxic drug-induced emesis, tissue serotonin (5-HT) concentrations of the area postrema and the ileum of ferrets were measured. Emesis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cisplatin (10 mg/kg) or cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). The number of retches and vomits were carefully recorded for 6 hours after drug administration. Intestinal 5-HT concentrations of the cisplatin-treated group significantly increased as compared with those of the control group. The 5-HT levels in the area postrema of the cisplatin- or cyclophosphamide-treated groups were significantly higher than those of the saline-treated control group. Ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, or abdominal vagotomy significantly reduced the number of retches and vomits induced by the cytotoxic agents. Pretreatment with ondansetron or abdominal vagotomy also significantly inhibited the increase of 5-HT concentration in the area postrema. These findings suggest that increased 5-HT levels in the area postrema might trigger the emetic response induced by antineoplastic agents.
