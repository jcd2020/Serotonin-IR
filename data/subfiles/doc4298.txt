	The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) 7 receptor (5-HT7R) is the most recently discovered 5-HT receptor, and its physiologic and possible pathophysiologic roles are not fully elucidated. So far, no suitable 5-HT7R PET radioligand is available, thus limiting the investigation of this receptor in the living brain. Here, we present the radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of Cimbi-712 (3-{4-[4-(4-methylphenyl)piperazine-1-yl]butyl}p-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one) and Cimbi-717 (3-{4-[4-(3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl]butyl}-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one) as selective 5-HT7R PET radioligands in the pig brain. The 5-HT7R distribution in the postmortem pig brain is also assessed. Methods: In vitro autoradiography with the 5-HT7R selective radioligand 3H-labeled (R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) ethyl) pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) phenol (SB-269970) was performed on pig brain sections to establish the 5-HT7R binding distribution. Radio-labeling of 5-HT7R selective compounds was performed in an automated synthesis module in which we conducted either palladium-mediated cross coupling (C-11-Cimbi-712) or conventional O-methylation (C-11-Cimbi-717) using C-11-MeI and C-11-MeOTf, respectively. After intravenous injection of the radioligands in Danish Landrace pigs, the in vivo brain distribution of the ligands was studied. Specific binding of C-11-Cimbi-712 and C-11-Cimbi-717 to 5-HT7R was investigated by intravenous administration of SB-269970 before a second PET scan. Results: High 5-HT7R density was found in the thalamus and cortical regions of the pig brain by autoradiography. The radio-synthesis of both radioligands succeeded after optimization efforts (radiochemical yield, similar to 20%-30% at the end of synthesis). Time-activity curves of C-11-Cimbi-712 and C-11-Cimbi-717 showed high brain uptake and distribution according to 5-HT7R distribution, but the tracer kinetics of C-11-Cimbi-717 were faster than C-11-Cimbi-712. Both radioligands were specific for 5-HT7R, as binding could be blocked by pretreatment with SB-269970 for C-11-Cimbi-717 in a dose-dependent fashion. For C-11-Cimbi-717, nondisplaceable binding potentials of 6.4 +/- 1.2 (n = 6) were calculated in the thalamus. Conclusion: Both C-11-Cimbi-712 and C-11-Cimbi-717 generated a specific binding in accordance with 5-HT7R distribution and are potential PET radioligands for 5-HT7R. C-11-Cimbi-717 is the better candidate because of the more reversible tracer kinetics, and this radioligand showed a dose-dependent decline in cerebral binding after receptor blockade. Thus, C-11-Cimbi-717 is currently the most promising radioligand for investigation of 5-HT7R binding in the living human brain.
