	Treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs (APDs) is accompanied by extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), which are thought to be due to striatal dopamine D-2 receptor blockade. In contrast, treatment with atypical APDs is marked by a low incidence or absence of EPS. The reduced motor side effect liability of atypical APDs has been attributed to a high serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity coupled with a relatively low D-2 affinity. Despite the high density of 5-HT2A binding sites in the striatum, there are few detectable 5-HT2A mRNA-expressing neurons in the striatum. This suggests that most striatal 5-HT2A receptors are heteroceptors located on afferent axons. A combined retrograde tracer-immunohistochemistry method was used to determine the sites of origin of striatal 5-HT2A-like immunoreactive axons. 5-HT2A-like immunoreactive neurons in both the cortex and globus pallidus were retrogradely labeled from the striatum; very few nigrostriatal or thalamostriatal neurons expressed 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity. Within the striatum, parvalbumin-containing interneurons displayed 5-HT2A immunolabeling; these neurons are the targets of cortical and pallidal projections. Our data indicate that cortico- and pallido-striatal neurons are the major source of 5-HT2A receptor binding in the striatum, and suggest that cortico- and pallido-striatal neurons are strategically positioned to reduce the motor side effects that accompany striatal D-2 receptor blockade or are seen in parkinsonism.
