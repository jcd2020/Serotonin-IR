Delgado, M., et al. (2005). "Anxiolytic-like effect of a serotonergic ligand with high affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors." Eur J Pharmacol 511(1): 9-19.

	S-(-)-2-[[4-(napht-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]methyl]-1,4-dioxoperhydropyrrolo[1,2-alpha]-pyrazine (CSP-2503) is a serotonin (5-HT) receptor ligand with selectivity and high affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors. CSP-2503 reduced rectal temperature and 5-HT neuronal hypothalamic activity in mice, decreased electrical activity of raphe nuclei cells in rats and blocked the enhancement of adenylate cyclase activity induced by forskolin in HeLa cells transfected with the human 5-HT1A receptor. This compound also blocked head-twitches induced by the 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). Contractions of guinea pig ileum induced by the 5-HT3 receptor agonist 2-methyl-5-HT were prevented by CSP-2503. Moreover, it reduced the bradycardia reflex induced by 2-methyl-5-HT in anaesthetized rats. In the light/dark box and social interaction tests, CSP-2503 presented anxiolytic activity, an action shared by 5-HT1 agonists and 5-HT3 antagonists. Taken together, these results suggest that CSP-2503 is a new 5-HT1 receptor agonist with 5-HT2A and 5-HT3)receptor antagonist activities that might be useful in a number of conditions associated with anxiety.
