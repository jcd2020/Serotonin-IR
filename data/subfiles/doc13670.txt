Xu, L., et al. (1997). "Effect of repeated ipsapirone treatment on hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission in the freely behaving rat: role of 5-HT1A receptors and relationship to anxiolytic effect." Eur J Pharmacol 323(1): 59-68.

	The effects of acute and repeated treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor ligand ipsapirone on hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission and in an ultrasonic vocalization anxiety test were investigated in the rat. Synaptic responses in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus of alert, freely behaving male Wistar rats were reduced after acute injection of ipsapirone (1 or 2 mg/kg, i.p.). This effect was prevented by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclo-hexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride, 0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) but not by the 5-HT-depleting agent para-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg per day for 3 days, i.p.). WAY-100635 (0.1-0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) also blocked the acute anti-aversive effects of ipsapirone (3 mg/kg, i.p.) in the anxiety test. Repeated administration of ipsapirone (1 or 2 mg/kg per day for 7-8 days, i.p.) produced a gradual reduction in baseline synaptic transmission which was transiently reversed by WAY-100635 (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.). Ipsapirone (1 mg/kg per day for 7 days) produced a gradual and sustained reduction in the duration of vocalizations in the anxiety test which paralleled the reduction in baseline synaptic responses in the same animals. The data indicate that with repeated administration of ipsapirone, a prolongation and enhancement of the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated reduction in hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission occurs. This delayed effect may contribute to the sustained anxiolytic and/or antidepressant effect of ipsapirone.
