	The existence of two different functional receptors for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was first proposed by Gaddum and Picarelli. Aided by the development of radioligand binding techniques, the heterogeneity of 5-HT receptors has become more apparent in the past ten years. There are three main types of 5-HT receptors: 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3. Moreover, 5-HT1 is heterogenous and can be divided into 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C and 5-HT1D subtypes. 5-HT1B is probably related to the 5-HT autoreceptor controlling 5-HT release. Multiple 5-HT receptors are differentially distributed throughout the brain, and the agonist-receptor interaction is altered by physical parameters and chemicals, suggesting that the receptors may be physiologically relevant. Three 5-HT receptor subtypes, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2, have been cloned. All three receptors contain approximately 450 amino acids arrayed as seven transmembrane domains. 5-HT1 and 5-HT1A are coupled to adenylate cyclase positively and negatively, respectively, while 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 are coupled positively to phospholipase C. 5-HT1A is also coupled to the opening of K+ channels in hippocampal pyramidal cells. A number of 5-HT-induced physiological responses have been shown to correlate with the 5-HT receptor subtypes. Based on a number of pharmacological studies, it seems likely that the mode of action of certain psychotropic drugs is closely related to the activity of central 5-HT receptors.
