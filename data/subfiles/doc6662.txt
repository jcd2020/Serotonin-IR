Lucas, J. J., et al. (1997). "5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) receptors modulate the effect of cocaine on c-fos expression: Converging evidence using 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) knockout mice and the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B/1D) antagonist GR127935." Molecular Pharmacology 51(5): 755-763.

	Serotonergic transmission has been suggested to modulate the effects of cocaine. However, the specific receptors and brain structures underlying this phenomenon have not been identified, To test the possible contribution of the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) (5-HT1B) receptor, we studied the induction of the immediate-early gene c-fos elicited by cocaine in knockout mice lacking this receptor. 5-HT1B knockout mice display a markedly reduced effect of cocaine on c-fos induction in different brain structures, most notably in the striatum. In addition, the administration to wild-type mice of the 5-HT1B receptor agonist RU24969 results in a striatal induction of c-fos expression very similar to that induced by cocaine in its time course, cellular and anatomical distribution, and pharmacology. Here, we also report the ability of a 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, GR127935, to antagonize 5-HT1D receptors in vivo. Finally, when administered to wild-type mice, GR127935 reduces the increase in striatal c-fos expression elicited by cocaine, These converging lines of evidence obtained with the knockout mice and 5-HT1B/1D antagonist indicate that cocaine acts as an indirect agonist of 5-HT1B receptors in vivo and demonstrate that activation of 5-HT1B receptors contributes to the cellular responses elicited by cocaine.
