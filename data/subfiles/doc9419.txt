	Medullary respiratory neurons are influenced by a variety of neuromodulators, but there is a lack of information about the specific intracellular signal pathways involved. In this report we describe the modulatory effects of the cyclic adenosine-triphosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase and of protein kinase C pathways on voltage- and ligand-controlled ionic conductances and demonstrate their functional significance in regulating the excitability of medullary respiratory neurons of the vivo cat. Evidence is presented that PKA and PKC pathways are persistently activated. PKA regulates current flow through persistently activated and GABAB receptor-controlled potassium channels as well as GABAA receptor-controlled chloride channels. PKC also depresses persistent potassium currents but it potentiates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents. The clinical significance of these intracellular signal pathways is demonstrated in a case of a child suffering from apneustic breathing, who was successfully treated with a 5HT-1A receptor agonist.
