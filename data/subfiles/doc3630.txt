Gariboldi, M., et al. (1996). "Stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal hippocampus and inhibition of limbic seizures induced by kainic acid in rats." British Journal of Pharmacology 119(5): 813-818.

	1 We studied whether the stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist, reduced electroencephalographic (EEG) seizures induced by intrahippocampal injection of 0.04 mu g in 0.5 mu l of the glutamate analogue kainic acid in freely-moving rats. 2 Pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT 15 min earlier at the same site as kainic acid injection, caused a dose-dependent decrease of kainic acid-induced seizure activity. One and 10 mu g significantly reduced the total time spent in seizures by 72% on average and the total number of seizures by 58% (P<0.01) and 43% (P<0.05) respectively. The latency to onset of the first seizure was increased 2.8 times (P<0.01) only after 1 mu g 8-OH-DPAT; 0.1 mu g was ineffective on all seizure parameters. 3 Systemic administration of 25, 100 and 1000 mu g kg(-1) 8-OH-DPAT significantly reduced the total number of seizures and the total time in seizures induced by intrahippocampal kainic acid by 52% and 74% on average. The latency to onset of the first seizure was delayed 1.8 times by 100 and 1000 mu g kg(-)1 (P<0.05). 4 The anticonvulsant action of 8-OH-DPAT given intrahippocampally or systemically was significantly blocked by 5 mu g, but not 1 mu g WAY 100635, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, administered in the hippocampus before the agonist. 5 These results indicate that postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the hippocampus mediate the anticonvulsant action of 8-OH-DPAT and that their stimulation has an inhibitory role in the generation of limbic seizures.
