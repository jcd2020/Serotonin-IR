	The influence of chronic (14 days) administration of 5-HTIA receptors agonist--8-OH-DPAT (0.05 mg/kg, s.c.) and 5-HT(1A) receptors antagonist NAN-190 (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) alone or in a combination with 17beta-estradiol (0.5 mg on each animal, i.m.) for on depressive behavior and expression of 5-HT(1A)-, 5-HT(2A)-, 17beta- estradiol receptors mRNAs was estimated in hippocampus in adult ovariectomized (OVX) female rats. The model of depression in rats was carried out in Porsolt test. The measurement of expression of 5-HT(1A)-, 5-HT(2A)-, 17beta-estradiol receptors mRNAs in the hippocampus was performed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. In Porsolt test 17beta-estradiol in OVX rats reduced time immobility to some extent. 8-OH-DPAT alone significantly decreased time immobility in OVX rats. Chronic 8-OH-DPAT administration in a combination with 17beta-estradiol in OVX females resulted in potentiated antidepressive effect. Simultaneously, 8-OH-DPAT induced significant increase of 5-HT(1A)-, 5-HT(2A)-receptors mRNAs expression and decrease of 17beta-estradiol receptor mRNA expression in hippocampus in OVX rats as compared to the control. The data obtained indicate a close interaction of the ovary hormonal and serotonergic systems of the brain in mechanisms of depression.
