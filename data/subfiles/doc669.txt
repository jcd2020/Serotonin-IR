Barre, L., et al. (1992). "SYNTHESIS AND REGIONAL RAT-BRAIN DISTRIBUTION OF C-11 MDL 72222 - A 5HT3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST." Applied Radiation and Isotopes 43(4): 509-516.

	MDL 72222, an antagonist of 5HT3 receptors, was labeled with a specific radioactivity of 340-400 mCi/mu-mol by alkylation of the nor-precursor with [C-11]CH3I. The yield of the synthesis, starting from [C-11]methyliodide to the purified product and corrected for decay, was good approximately 70-75%. After i.v. injection, [C-11]MDL 72222 diffuses readily in the central nervous system but is not detected as metabolites in brain and blood, during 1 h study carried out in rats. The time course and distribution of [C-11]MDL 72222 was assessed in various organs (liver, lung, kidney, heart, whole brain) and in blood; the organ uptake was rapid and large; the highest accumulation was found in the lung. The regional brain distribution shows initial uptake and subsequent retention of tracer in favor of the cerebral cortex. The level of brain radioactivity was not reduced by pretreatment with a 1000-fold excess of unlabeled MDL 72222. These results suggest that [C-11]MDL 72222 is of limited interest for 5HT3 receptor binding studies in brain in vivo, presumably mainly because of large non-specific binding.
