	The present study was performed to examine an overall effect of endogenous serotonin (5-HT) on the spontaneous firing activity of the dorsal hippocampus CA1 pyramidal neurons in quiet awake rats. A selective 5-HT,A antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2(-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635: 0.03-0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly increased the firing activity. A depletion of 5-HT with parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA: 500 mg/kg/day X 3 days) completely abolished this increasing effect of WAY-100635. The baseline spike frequency of the PCPA-treated rats (3.90 +/- 0.39 Hz) was significantly higher than that of the vehicle-treated mts (2.09 +/- 0.29 Hz). A 5-HT2A antagonist ritanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p.) and a 5-HT3/4 antagonist 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chloro benzoic acid 2-(diethylamino) ethyl ester (SDZ-205557: 3 mg/kg,s.c.) did not modify the firing activity and the increasing effect of WAY-100635. These results suggest that, in quiet awake rats, endogenous 5-HT would tonically inhibit the spontaneous firing activity of the CA1 pyramidal neurons mainly through stimulating 5-HT1A receptors.
