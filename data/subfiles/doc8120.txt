	The lamina II, also called the substantia gelatinosa (SG), of the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc), is thought to play an essential role in the control of orofacial nociception. Glycine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) are the important neurotransmitters that have the individual parts on the modulation of nociceptive transmission. However, the electrophysiological effects of 5-HT on the glycine receptors on SG neurons of the Vc have not been well studied yet. For this reason, we applied the whole-cell patch clamp technique to explore the interaction of intracellular signal transduction between 5-HT and the glycine receptors on SG neurons of the Vc in mice. In nine of 13 neurons tested (69.2%), pretreatment with 5-HT1 potentiated glycine-induced current (l(Gly)). Firstly, we examined with a 5-HT1 receptor agonist (8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT1/7 agonist, co-applied with SB-269970, 5-HT(1 )antagonist) and antagonist (WAY-100635), but 5-HT1 receptor agonist did not increase l(Gly) and in the presence of 5-HT1 antagonist, the potentiation of 5-HT on l(Gly) still happened. However, an agonist (alpha-methyl-5-HT) and antagonist (ketanserin) of the 5-HT2 receptor mimicked and inhibited the enhancing effect of 5-HT on l(Gly) in the SG neurons, respectively. We also verified the role of the 5-HT7 receptor by using a 5-HT7 antagonist (SB-269970) but it also did not block the enhancement of 5-HT on l(Gly). Our study demonstrated that 5-HT facilitated l(Gly) in the SG neurons of the Vc through the 5-HT, receptor. The interaction between 5-HT and glycine appears to have a significant role in modulating the transmission of the nociceptive pathway.
