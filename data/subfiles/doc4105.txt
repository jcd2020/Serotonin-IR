Gur, E., et al. (1999). "Venlafaxine: acute and chronic effects on 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in rat brain in vivo." Eur J Pharmacol 372(1): 17-24.

	Venlafaxine is a dual serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) and noradrenaline uptake inhibitor which has been claimed to have an onset of antidepressant action which is faster than for other comparable drugs. The effects of venlafaxine on brain 5-HT levels in vivo have not yet been examined. Acute administration of venlafaxine to rats by i.p. injection resulted in dose-dependent increases in cortical and hippocampal 5-HT levels, as measured by in vivo microdialysis, over the range 5-20 mg/kg. The effect of venlafaxine (10 mg/kg i.p.) was potentiated by prior administration of pindolol (10 mg/kg s.c.) in hippocampus but not in frontal cortex. Daily administration of venlafaxine (5 mg/kg i.p.) for 4 weeks did not change basal 5-HT levels in either brain area. The effect of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.2 mg/kg s.c.) to reduce 5-HT levels was unaffected by chronic venlafaxine at this dose, indicating that there was no change in sensitivity of presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors.
