	Mirtazapine (MIR) is an antidepressant which enhances noradrenergic and serotonergic 5-HT1A neurotransmission via antagomism of central alpha(2)-adrenergic autoreceptors and heteroreceptors. The drugs does not inhibit noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake but blocks the 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors and has high affinity only for central and peripheral histamine Hi receptors. The present study was aimed at determining whether repeated MIR treatment induced adaptive changes in the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, similar to those reported by us early for tricyclic antidepressants, The experiments were carried out on male mice and rats. MIR was administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg once or repeatedly (twice daily for 14 days). The obtained results showed that MIR administrated repeatedly potentiated the methoxamine- induced exploratory hyperactivity in rats and clonidine-induced aggressiveness in mice, those effects being mediated by alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. MIR given repeatedly (but not acutely) increased the binding (B-max) of [H-3]prazosin to alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors in cerebral cortex, however, the ability of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist phenylephrine to compete for the these sites was not significantly changed. The above results indicate that repeated MIR administration increases the responsiveness or alpha(1)-adrenergic system (behavioural and biochemical changes), as tricyclics do. However, the question whether the increased functional responsiveness found in the present study is important for the clinical antidepressant efficacy, remains open.
