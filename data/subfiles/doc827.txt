	(+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a commonly abused illicit drug which affects multiple organ systems. In animals, high-dose administration of MDMA produces deficits in serotonin (5-HT) neurons (e.g., depletion of forebrain 5-HT) that have been Viewed as neurotoxicity. Recent data implicate MDMA In the development of valvular heart disease (VHD). The present paper reviews several issues related to MDMA-associated neural and cardiac toxicities. The hypothesis of MDMA neurotoxicity in rats is evaluated in terms of the effects of MDMA on monoamine neurons, the use of scaling methods to extrapolate MDMA doses across species, and functional consequences of MDMA exposure. A potential treatment regimen (L-5-hydroxytryptophan plus carbidopa) for MDMA-associated neural deficits is discussed. The pathogenesis of MDMA-associated VHD is reviewed with specific reference to the role of valvular 5-HT2B receptors. We conclude that pharmacological effects of MDMA occur at the same doses in rats and humans. High doses of MDMA that produce 5-HT depletions in rats are associated with tolerance and impaired 5-HT release. Doses of NIMM that fail to deplete 5-HT in rats can cause persistent behavioral dysfunction, suggesting even moderate doses may pose risks. Finally, the MDMA metabolite, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDA), is a potent 5-HT2B agonist which could contribute to the increased risk of VHD observed in heavy MDMA users.
