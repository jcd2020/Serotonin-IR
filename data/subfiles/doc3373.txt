	We investigated the possible role of 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) on salt intake response during basal conditions and following natriorexigenic challenge aroused by sodium depletion in rats. Acute systemic administration (76-1520 nmol/kg s.c.) of 8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptor agonist, induced a clear and close-dependent preference for salt intake through free choice between water and 0.3 M NaCl simultaneously offered under basal conditions. Acute intra-DRN microinjection (7.5 nmol/rat) of 8-OH-DPAT significantly mimicked the acute systemic protocol in sodium-replete rats. Interestingly, microinjection of 8-OH-DPAT into the DRN raised an additional long-lasting increase of 0.3 M NaCl intake in sodium-depleted rats despite a high volume ingested 30 min after central injection. Conversely, chronic systemic treatment (1520 nmol/kg s.c.) with 8-OH-DPAT for 2 and 3 weeks or repeated intra-DRN microinjection (7.5 nmol/rat) evoked a significant long-term decrease in 0.3 M NaCl intake in sodium-depleted rats given only water and a sodium-deficient diet over the course of 24 h after furosemide injection. These results show a clear-cut involvement of the DRN 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors in sodium satiety signaling under basal conditions and during the consummatory phase of salt intake in sodium-depleted rats.
