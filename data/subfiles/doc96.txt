	Agomelatine is a potent MT1 and MT2 melatonin receptor agonist and a 5-HT2C serotonin receptor antagonist. We analyzed whether agomelatine has anticonvulsant properties. The anticonvulsant activity of agomelatine (25, 50 or 75 mg/kg, i.p.) was evaluated in mouse models of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ-85 mg/kg, i.p.), pilocarpine (400 mg/kg, i.p.), picrotoxin (7 mg/kg, i.p.), strychnine (75 mg/kg, i.p.) or electroshock-induced convulsions. In the PTZ-induced seizure model, agomelatine (at 25 or 50 mg/kg) showed a significant increase in latency to convulsion, and agomelatine (at 50 or 75 mg/kg) also increased significantly time until death. In the pilocarpine-induced seizure model, only agomelatine in high doses (75 mg/kg) showed a significant increase in latency to convulsions and in time until death. In the strychnine- ,electroshock- and picrotoxin-induced seizure models, agomelatine caused no significant alterations in latency to convulsions and in time until death when compared to controls. Our results suggest that agomelatine has anticonvulsant activity shown in PTZ- or pilocarpine-induced seizure models. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
