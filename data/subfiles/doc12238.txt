	The present study was designed to examine the effects of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of Dopamine (10, 20 and 40 nmol), L-DOPA (dopamine precursor; 62.5, 125 and 250 nmol), 6-OHDA (dopamine inhibitor; 75, 150 and 300 nmol), SCH 23390 (D-1 antagonist; 2.5, 5 and 10 nmol), AMI-193 (D-2 antagonist; 2.5, 5 and 10 nmol), NGB2904 (D-3 antagonist; 3.2, 6.4 and 12.8 nmol), L-741 T742 (D-4 antagonist; 1.5, 3 and 6 nmol) on food intake in FD3 chickens. At following, birds were ICV injected using 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A agonist; 15.25 nmol) and SB242084 (5-HT2C antagonist; 1.5 mu g) prior dopamine (40 nmol) injection. Cumulative food intake was determined until 3 h post-injection. According to the results, dopamine significantly decreased food intake in chickens (p < 0.05). The inhibitory effect of dopamine on food intake was decreased by SCH 23390 pretreatment (P < 0.05), but AMI-193, NGB2904 and L-741, 742 had no effect on food intake induced by dopamine. In addition, hypophagic effect of dopamine was attenuated by SB242084 (P < 0.05), but 8-OH-DPAT had no effect. These results suggest that dopamine decrease food intake via D-1 receptor and there is an interaction between dopaminergic and serotonergic systems via 5-HT2C receptor in chickens.
