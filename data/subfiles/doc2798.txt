	Previous work in this laboratory demonstrated that the 19- and 35-day-old offspring of ethanol-fed rats have a significant deficiency of cortical serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), as well as a decrease in the number of total 5-HT1 receptors in the motor and somatosensory cortex. The present studies extend our previous reports by demonstrating that there is also a deficit of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the motor cortex but not in the somatosensory cortex. In addition, we have shown that a deficit of 5-HT1A receptors in the motor and somatosensory cortices contributes to the deficit of total 5-HT1 receptors. In contrast, we did not observe any changes in the binding to 5-HT1B receptors in these cortical regions from the 19-day-old offspring of ethanol-fed rats. The present studies also examined the effects of in utero ethanol exposure on the early development of the serotonergic system. The results of these studies demonstrated a deficit of 5-HT and/or 5-HIAA in the brain stem as early as the 15th day of gestation (G15) and in the cortex as early as G19. In addition, we demonstrated a delay in both the normal developmental decline of 5-HT1A receptors in the brain stem and in the acquisition of cortical 5-HT1A receptors. No changes were found in the binding of [125I]cyanopindolol to 5-HT1B receptors in either region of fetal or neonatal rats exposed to ethanol in utero.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
