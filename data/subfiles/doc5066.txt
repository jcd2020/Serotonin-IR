	The role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the propagation of neuronal excitation in the hippocampal-septal pathway was examined in a brain slice by optical and electrophysiological recording techniques. After electrical stimulation of the fimbrial pathway, optical signals first occurred at the caudal region of lateral septal nucleus (LSN), then propagated toward the rostral region of LSN. All of the evoked optical signals were blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX). The optical signal that propagated to the LSN was blocked by either the removal of external Ca2+ or bath-application of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-(1H,4H)-dione (CNQX). Bath-application of 5-HT (1-50 muM) to the LSN for 10 min produced an increase in the propagation area of the optical signal and prolonged the falling phase of the optical signal. Bicuculline blocked the 5-HT-induced facilitation of the optical signal. 8-Hydroxy-di-n-propylamino tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a selective 5-HT1A agonist, mimicked the facilitation of 5-HT. 1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-4-(4-phthalimidobutyl)piperazine (NAN-190), a 5-HT1A antagonist, blocked the facilitation induced by 5-HT. 5-HT enhanced the amplitude of the held potential in septal slices, where the optical signals had been enhanced. These results indicate that 5-HT increases the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampal-septal circuit via 5-HT1A receptors of LSN neurons.
