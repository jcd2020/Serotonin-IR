	Coadministration of atypical antipsychotics and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) enhances the release of monoamines such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), and serotonin (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex. To clarify the role of DA-D2/3 receptors in the combination effect, we examined the effects of coadministration of the selective DA-D2/3 antagonist sulpiride and the SSRI fluvoxamine on amine neurotransmitter release in rat prefrontal cortex. Sulpiride (10 mg/kg, i.p.) and fluvoxamine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) alone did not affect extracellular DA levels, while their coadministration caused a significant increase in DA levels. Sulpiride alone did not affect extracellular levels of 5-HT and NE in the prefrontal cortex, while fluvoxamine alone caused a marked increase in 5-HT levels and a slight increase in NE levels. Sulpiride did not affect the fluvoxamine-induced increases in extracellular levels of 5-HT and NE. The DA-D2/3 antagonist haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) in combination with fluvoxamine also caused a selective increase in extracellular DA levels in the cortex. Coadministration of sulpiride and fluvoxamine did not affect extracellular DA levels in the striatum. Combination of systemic sulpiride and local fluvoxamine did not increase the DA levels, but that of systemic fluvoxamine with local sulpiride increased. The combination effect in increasing prefrontal DA levels was antagonized systemically, but not locally, by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 at a low dose. These findings suggest that the combination of prefrontal DA-D2/3 receptor blockade and 5-HT1A receptor activation in regions other than the cortex plays an important role in sulpiride and fluvoxamine-induced increase in prefrontal DA release.
