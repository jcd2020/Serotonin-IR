Martin, C. B. P., et al. (2010). The Role of 5-HT2C Receptors in the Antidepressant Response: A Critical Review.

	There is evidence for altered 5-HT2C receptor function in anxiodepressive disorders and many antidepressant drugs have a primary action at these receptors Although the notion of 5-HT2C receptor desensitization following prolonged treatment with drugs that increase the synaptic availability of 5-HT is well anchored in the literature, this concept is based mainly on in vitro assays and/or behavioral assays that have little relevance to depression Our objective herein is to provide a comprehensive overview of the studies that have assessed the effects of antidepressant treatments on 5-HT2C receptors Relevant neurochemical (receptor binding and mRNA levels), physiological (5-HT2C-receptor-induced hyperthermia and hormone release) and behavioral (5-HT2C-receptor-induced changes in feeding, anxiety, defense and motor activity) data are summarized and discussed Our extensive analysis of the literature clearly evidences a crucial lack of studies investigating changes in 5-HT2C receptor function in selected brain areas following antidepressant treatments, mainly because adequate tools are lacking Although the notion of an overall desensitization of 5-HT2C receptors by antidepressant drugs has been challenged, the hypothesis appears nevertheless well supported by clear-cut data in selected brain areas Setting the record straight about drug-induced changes in 5-HT2C receptor function should help in determining which pharmacotherapeutic strategy is the best in anxiety and depression Copyright (C) 2010 S Karger AG Basel
