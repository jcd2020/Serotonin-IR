	The serotonin agonist quipazine has been shown to cause phase shifts in melatonin and activity rhythms and to induce c-fos in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of rats. In this study, in vivo pharmacological characterisation of the phase shifting properties of serotonin agonists has been performed, with a view to determining the receptor sub-types involved. Agonists for the 5-HT2a/2c receptors, (+/-)-1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI, 0.1 mg/k), 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-piperazine HCl (mCPP, 2 mg/kg) and N-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine HCl (TFMPP, 2 mg/kg) injected at CT18 resulted in acute transient inhibition of melatonin production and delays in the onset of production on the following nights of 1.2+/-0.2, 1.7+/-0.3 and 1. 4+/-0.8 h respectively. Drugs specific for 5-HT1a/7 and 5-HT3 receptors failed to affect melatonin production. At a dose of 0.07 micromole/kg, the serotonin antagonist, ritanserin inhibited the DOI induced phase delay whereas ketanserin was ineffective at this dose, providing strong evidence that DOI was acting through 5-HT2c receptors. DOI (0.5 mg/kg) at CT18 provoked a phase delay in the core body temperature rhythm of similar magnitude to that following a light pulse. Administration of DOI but not agonists active at other receptor sites resulted in the appearance of c-Fos in the ventrolateral division of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) at CT18 but not at CT6. Ritanserin was more potent than ketanserin at inhibiting the DOI induced increase in c-Fos labelled cells in the SCN. When rats were pre-treated with metergoline (15 mg/kg), ritanserin (3 mg/kg) or LY 53,857 (3 mg/kg) prior to a 2 lx/ 1 min light pulse, none of the drugs significantly inhibited the responses to light. The results of these experiments indicate that serotonergic agonists active at the 5-HT2c receptor mimic the effects of light on 2 independent rhythms and activate SCN neurones in the rat.
