Fuxe, K., et al. (1998). Galanin modulates 5-hydroxytryptamine functions focus on galanin and galanin fragment 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) receptor interactions in the brain. Galanin: Basic Research Discoveries and Therapeutic Implications. T. Hokfelt, T. Bartfai and J. Crawley. 863: 274-290.

	The reciprocal interactions between galanin and 5-HT(1A) receptors in the rat brain are presented. Galanin and its NH(2)-terminal fragments antagonize 5-HT(1A) receptor-mediated transmission at the postjunctional level, whereas galanin receptor activation mimics the inhibitory action of 5-HT(1A) receptor activation at the soma-dendritic level. leading to reductions of 5-HT metabolism and release. These interactions have been shown in both receptor binding studies and functional studies, In view of the present findings, galanin antagonists may represent a new type of antidepressant drug, based on the 5-HT hypothesis of depression, by enhancing 5-HT release and postjunctional 5-HT(1A)-mediated transmission. Moreover, following intracerebroventricular injection galanin was found to be internalized In a population of hippocampal nerve cells mainly representing GABA, somatostatin, and/or NPY-immunoreactive nerve cells. The relevance of these findings is discussed in relation to the concept of volume transmission.
