	The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a (5-HT2A) selective radiotracer [F-18]altanserin has been subjected to a quantitative micro-positron emission tomography study in Lister Hooded rats. Metabolite-corrected plasma input modeling was compared with reference tissue modeling using the cerebellum as reference tissue. [F-18]altanserin showed sufficient brain uptake in a distribution pattern consistent with the known distribution of 5-HT2A receptors. Full binding saturation and displacement was documented, and no significant uptake of radioactive metabolites was detected in the brain. Blood input as well as reference tissue models were equally appropriate to describe the radiotracer kinetics. [F-18]altanserin is suitable for quantification of 5-HT2A receptor availability in rats.
