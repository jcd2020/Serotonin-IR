Shimoda, Y., et al. (2013). "Synthesis and evaluation of 1-[2-(4-[(11)C]methoxyphenyl)phenyl]piperazine for imaging of the serotonin 5-HT7 receptor in the rat brain." Bioorg Med Chem 21(17): 5316-5322.

	1-[2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)phenyl]piperazine (4) is a potent serotonin 5-HT7 receptor antagonist (Ki=2.6nM) with a low binding affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (Ki=476nM). As a potential positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for the 5-HT7 receptor, [(11)C]4 was synthesized at high radiochemical yield and specific activity, by O-[(11)C]methylation of 2'-(piperazin-1-yl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-ol (6) with [(11)C]methyl iodide. Autoradiography revealed that [(11)C]4 showed in vitro specific binding with 5-HT7 in the rat brain regions, such as the thalamus which is a region with high 5-HT7 expression. Metabolite analysis indicated that intact [(11)C]4 in the brain exceeded 90% of the radioactive components at 15min after the radiotracer injection, although two radiolabeled metabolites were found in the rat plasma. The PET study of rats showed moderated uptake of [(11)C]4 in the brain (1.2SUV), but no significant regional difference in radioactivity in the brain. Pretreatment with 5-HT7-selective antagonist SB269970 (3) did not decrease the uptake of [(11)C]4 in the rat brain. Further studies are warranted that focus on the development of PET ligand candidates with higher binding affinity for 5-HT7 and higher in vivo stability in brain than 4.
