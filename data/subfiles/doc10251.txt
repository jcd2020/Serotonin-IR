Poeschla, B., et al. (1992). "THE 5-HT1A AGONIST 8-OH-DPAT ATTENUATES THE SATIATING ACTION OF CHOLECYSTOKININ." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 42(3): 541-543.

	To investigate the dependence of the satiating action of cholecystokinin (CCK) on serotonergic action at central 5-HT receptors, we examined the effect of systemic pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT (a 5-HT1A agonist that decreases central 5-HT synthesis and release via an action at somatodendritic autoreceptors in the brainstem raphe) on the suppression of food intake induced by systemic administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide (CKK-8). 8-OH-DPAT significantly attenuated the satiating action of CKK-8. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that peripherally acting CCK recruits central serotonergic processes to elicit normal satiety.
