Kostowski, W., et al. (1993). "THE ABILITIES OF 5-HT(3)RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST ICS 205-930 TO INHIBIT ALCOHOL PREFERENCE AND WITHDRAWAL SEIZURES IN RATS." Alcohol 10(5): 369-373.

	Recent evidence suggests that central 5-HT3 are intimately involved in the ethanol (ETOH) dependence mechanism. In the present study we observed the effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 on audiogenic seizure response (ASR) in ETOH-withdrawn rats and on ETOH intake and preference. Low doses of ICS 205-930 (0.001 mg/kg), but not higher doses (0.1 mg/kg), markedly reduced both ASR and ETOH intake in a high preference group of animals. The possible mechanism of different effects of low and high drug doses is discussed.
