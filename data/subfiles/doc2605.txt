Derkach, K. V., et al. (2015). "[THE THYROID STATUS OF RATS IMMUNIZED WITH PEPTIDES DERIVED FROM THE EXTRACELLULAR REGIONS OF THE TYPES 3 AND 4 MELANOCORTIN RECEPTORS AND THE 1B-SUBTYPE 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RECEPTOR]." Zh Evol Biokhim Fiziol 51(4): 243-250.

	The activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis is controlled by the brain neurotransmitter systems, including the melanocortin signaling system. Pharmacological inhibition of type 4 melanocortin receptor (M4R) leads to disruption of the functioning of HPT axis and to reduction of the level of thyroid hormones. At the same time, the data on how prolonged inhibition of M4R affects this axis and on its role in regulation of M3R are absent. The relationship between the thyroid status and the activity of 1B-subtype 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor (5-HT1BR) is scarcely explored. The aim of this work to study the effects of chronic inhibition of M3R, M4R and 5-HT1BR induced by immunization of rats with BSA-conjugated peptide derived from the extracellular regions of these receptors on the thyroid status and the activity of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)-sensitive adenylyl cyclase signaling system (ACSS) in the thyroid glarid (TG) of the immunized animals. In rats immunized with the peptides K-[TSLHL WNRSSHGLHG11-25]-A of M4R, A[PTNPYCICTTAH269-280]-A of M3R and. [QAKAEE-EVSEC(Acm)-VVNTDH189-205]-A of 5-HT1BR levels of thyroid hormones such as fT4, tT4 and tT3 were significantly reduced. In rats immunized with M4R and M3R peptides, an increase of TSH was detected whereas in the animals immunized with 5-HT1BR peptide the level of TSH, on the contrary, was reduced. In the TG of rats immunized with M4R and M3R peptides, the stimulatory effects of hormones (TSH, PA-CAP-3 8) and GppNHp on adenylyl cyclase activity were attenuated, and the changes were most pronounced in the case M4R peptide immunization. After immunization with 5-HT1BR peptide the stimulatory effects of TSH, PACAP-38 and GppNHp were retained. Thus, the main cause of thyroid hormones deficit in rats immunized with M4R and M3R peptides was the decreased sensitivity of ACSS thyrocytes to TSH, whereas in rats iimunized with 5-HT1BR peptide the deficit of thyroid hormones was associated with decreased level of TSH. Our data on the negative impact of long-term immunization of rats with BSA-conjugated peptides derived from the extracellular regions of M4R, M3R.and 5-HT1BR on their thyroid status is a strong argument in favor of participation of these receptors and intracellular signaling pathways associated with them in the regulation of HPT axis.
