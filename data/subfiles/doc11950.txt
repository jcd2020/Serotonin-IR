Wurch, T., et al. (1997). "Sequence and functional analysis of cloned guinea pig and rat serotonin 5-HT1D receptors, common pharmacological features within the 5-HT1D receptor subfamily." Journal of Neurochemistry 68(1): 410-418.

	This study was undertaken to investigate the pharmacology of cloned guinea pig and rat 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin; 5-HT)(1D) receptor sites. Guinea pig, rat, and mouse 5-HT1D receptor genes were cloned, and their amino acid sequences were compared with those of the human, dog, and rabbit, The overall amino acid sequence identity between these 5-HT1D receptors is high and varies between 86 and 99%, The sequence homology is slightly more divergent (13-27%) in the N-terminal extracellular region of these 5-HT1D receptors, Guinea pig and rat 5-HT1D receptors, stably and separately expressed in rat C6 glial cells, are negatively coupled to cyclic AMP formation upon stimulation with agonists, as previously found for cloned human 5-HT1D receptor sites. The cyclic AMP data show some common pharmacological features for the 5-HT1D receptors of guinea pig, rat, and human: an almost similar rank order of potency for the investigated 5-HT1D receptor agonists, stereoselectivity for the binding affinity and agonist potency of R(+)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin, and equal 5-HT1D receptor-mediated antagonist potency for methiothepin and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists ritanserin and ketanserin. In conclusion, the pharmacology of the cloned 5-HT1D receptor subtype seems, unlike the 5-HT1B receptor subtype, conserved among various mammal species such as the human, guinea pig, and rat.
