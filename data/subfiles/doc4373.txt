Hasegawa, M., et al. (2002). "Studies for the emetic mechanisms of ipecac syrup (TJN-119) and its active components in ferrets: Involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors." Japanese Journal of Pharmacology 89(2): 113-119.

	Ipecac syrup, prepared from a galentical ipecac, contains the nauseant alkaloids cephaeline and emetine. The involvement of receptors and serotonin- and dopamine-metabolizing enzymes in the emesis induced by ipecac syrup and these components was investigated. 1) In ferrets, the selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) prevented each emesis induced by TJN-119 (0.5 mL/kg, p.o.), cephaeline (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) and emetine (5.0 mg/kg, p.o.), but the intraperitoneal administration of the selective dopamine D-2-receptor antagonist sulpiride failed to significantly suppress the TJN-119, cephaeline and emetine-induced emesis at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg that blocked apomorphine-induced emesis. 2) In the receptor binding assays, cephaeline and emetine had a distinct affinity to 5-HT4 receptor, but no or weak affinity to 5-HT1A. 5-HT3, nicotine, M-3, beta(1), NK1 and D-2 receptors. 3) Cephaeline and emetine did not affect activities of metabolic enzymes of 5-HT and dopamine (NIAO-A, MAO-B, tryptophan 5-hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase) in vitro. These results suggest that 5-HT3 receptor plays an important role in the emetic action of TJN-119, cephaeline and emetine, and the 5-HT4 receptor may be involved in their mechanisms.
