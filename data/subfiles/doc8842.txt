Pike, V. W., et al. (1995). "FIRST DELINEATION OF 5-HT1A RECEPTOR IN HUMAN BRAIN WITH PET AND C-11 WAY-100635." European Journal of Pharmacology 283(1-3): R1-R3.

	The selective 5-HT1A receptor radioligand, [C-11]WAY-100635 {[C-11]N-2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)N-2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide}, has been injected intravenously into healthy male volunteers and studied by PET (positron emission tomography). The results provide the first delineation of 5-HT1A receptors in living human brain and demonstrate the potential to use [C-11]WAY-100635 for the study of central 5-HT1A receptors in patients with psychiatric and neurological disorders and for the investigation of the pharmacology of drugs acting on the central nervous system.
