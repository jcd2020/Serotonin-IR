	Adenosine is a powerful central neuromodulator acting via opposing A(1) (inhibitor) and A(2a) (activator) receptors. However, in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), both adenosine receptor subtypes attenuate cardiopulmonary chemoreflex (CCR) sympathoinhibition of renal, adrenal, and lumbar sympathetic nerve activity and attenuate reflex decreases in arterial pressure and heart rate. Adenosine A(1) receptors inhibit glutamatergic transmission in the CCR pathway, whereas adenosine A(2a) receptors most likely facilitate release of an unknown inhibitory neurotransmitter, which, in turn, inhibits the CCR. We hypothesized that adenosine A2a receptors inhibit the CCR via facilitation of GABA release in the NTS. In urethane-chloralose-anesthetized rats (n = 51), we compared regional sympathetic responses evoked by stimulation of the CCR with right atrial injections of the 5-HT3 receptor agonist phenylbiguanide (1-8 mu g/kg) before and after selective stimulation of NTS adenosine A(2a) receptors [microinjections into the NTS of CGS-21680 (20 pmol/50 nl)] preceded by blockade of GABA(A) or GABA(B) receptors in the NTS [bicuculline (10 pmol/100 nl) or SCH-50911 (1 nmol/100 nl)]. Blockade of GABAA receptors virtually abolished adenosine A(2a) receptor-mediated inhibition of the CCR. GABA(B) receptors had much weaker but significant effects. These effects were similar for the different sympathetic outputs. We conclude that stimulation of NTS adenosine A(2a) receptors inhibits CCR-evoked hemodynamic and regional sympathetic reflex responses via a GABA-ergic mechanism.
