	The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of central 5-HT2C receptor binding in rat model of pancreatic regeneration using 60-70% pancreatectomy. The 5-HT and 5-HT2C receptor kinetics were studied in cerebral cortex and brain stem of sham operated, 72 h pancreatectomised and 7 days pancreatectomised rats. Scatchard analysis with [H-3] mesulergine in cerebral cortex showed a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in maximal binding (B-max) without any change in K-d in 72 h pancreatectomised rats compared with sham. The decreased B-max reversed to sham level by 7 days after pancreatectomy. In brain stem, Scatchard analysis showed a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in B-max with a significant increase (p < 0.01) in K-d. Competition analysis in brain stem showed a shift in affinity towards a low affinity. These parameters were reversed to sham level by 7 days after pancreatectomy. Thus the results suggest that 5-HT through the 5-HT2C receptor in the brain has a functional regulatory role in the pancreatic regeneration.
