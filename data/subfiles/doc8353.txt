	Repinotan is a high-affinity, selective, full agonist of the 5HT1A-receptor subtype with neuroprotective properties. This paper presents the results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study examining the safety and tolerability of three different doses of repinotan in patients with severe traumatic brain injury. Sixty patients were enrolled to receive repinotan (0.5, 1.25, or 2.50 mg/day) or placebo, by continuous i.v. infusion for 7 days. Repinotan treatment had no apparent adverse effects on intracranial pressure, hemodynamic parameters or laboratory parameters. No seizures occurred during treatment, and the incidence and severity of adverse events was as expected for this indication. No serious adverse events were considered related to drug treatment, with the possible exception of one case of inappropriate ADH secretion. No further safety concerns were raised during the 3 months following treatment. On a descriptive basis, the proportion of patients having good outcome or moderate disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale) was somewhat greater in repinotan-treated patients (60%) than in placebo (50%).
