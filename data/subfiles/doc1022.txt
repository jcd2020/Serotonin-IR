	Serotonin (5HT) is a biologically active amine with diverse roles in the mammalian organism. Developmental alterations in 5HT homeostasis could lead to exposure of the developing brain to non-optimal serotonin concentrations that may result in developmental and behavioral deficits. In order to explore the molecular basis of the effects of developmental disturbances on 5HT metabolism on adult central 5HT homeostasis, observed in our previous studies, we measured changes in gene expression of the neuronal 5HT-regulating proteins in adult animals after perinatal treatment with the immediate 5HT precursor 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HTP, 25 mg/kg), or monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor tranylcypromine (TCP 2 mg/kg), during the period of the most intensive development of 5HT neurons - from gestational day 12 until postnatal day 21. Adult animals were sacrificed and the relative mRNA levels for tryptophan hydroxylase 2, MAO A, MAO B, receptors 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2A), 5HT transporter (5HTT) and vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) were determined in the raphe nuclei region and prefrontal cortex using Real-Time Relative qRT-PCR. In comparison to the saline treated animals, treatment with 5HTP caused mild but significant increase in MAO A and MAO B mRNA abundance. TCP-treated animals, besides an increase in mRNA abundance for both MAO genes, displayed significantly increased 5HTT and VMAT2 mRNA levels and significantly decreased 5HT1A receptor mRNA levels. Our results suggest that perinatal exposure of rats to 5HTP, and especially TCP, induces long-lasting/permanent changes in the expression of 5HT-regulating genes, that presumably underlie 5HT-related neurochemical and behavioral changes in adult animals.
