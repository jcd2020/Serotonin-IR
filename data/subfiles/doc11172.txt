	In this study, it has been clearly demonstrated that a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A agonist, 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetraline (8-OH-DPAT, 1 microM) significantly inhibited forskolin (10 microM)-stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation in the C6BU-1 cells transfected with 5-HT1A receptor gene. Further, this 8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity was significantly attenuated after pre-exposure to 5-HT (10 microM) for 12 h. Spiperone (10 microM), a 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A antagonist, prevented 5-HT-induced desensitization of 5-HT1A receptor, but a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, ketanserin, did not. In addition, pre-exposure to a selective 5-HT2A agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI, 10 microM), for 24 h did not alter the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in these transfected cells, suggesting that prolonged exposure to 5-HT induced 5-HT1A receptor desensitization, mediated by 5-HT1A receptor but not 5-HT2A receptors.
