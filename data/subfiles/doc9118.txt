Pullar, I. A., et al. (2000). "LY367265, an inhibitor of the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter and 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) receptor antagonist: a comparison with the antidepressant, nefazodone." Eur J Pharmacol 407(1-2): 39-46.

	The potential antidepressant, LY367265 (1-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-3, 6-dihydro-1(2H)-pyridinyl]ethyl]-5,6-dihydro-1H,4H-[1,2, 5]thiadiazolo[4.3.2-ij]quinoline-2,2,-dioxide) has been shown to have a higher affinity for the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) transporter (K(i)=2.3 nM) and 5-HT(2A) (K(i)=0.81 nM) receptor than the clinically effective antidepressant, nefazodone. It is a potent inhibitor of [3H]5-HT uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes (IC(50)=3.1 nM) and shows selectivity over that for [3H]noradrenaline (IC(50)>1000 nM). It potentiates potassium-induced [3H]5-HT outflow from prelabelled guinea pig cortical slices both in the presence (EC(50)=950 nM) and absence (EC(50)=250 nM) of a saturating concentration of the 5-HT transport inhibitor, paroxetine, indicating a low level of activity at the 5-HT(1B/1D) autoreceptor. These studies indicate that LY367265 is a putative antidepressant which, because of its 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist activity, has the potential to produce less sleep disturbance and sexual dysfunction than selective serotonin uptake inhibitors.
