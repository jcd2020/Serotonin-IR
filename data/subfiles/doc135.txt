	Serotonin(3) (5-HT3) receptors in the periphery mediate anorectic responses to the amino acid deficiency, which occurs after eating amino acid-imbalanced diets (IMB). However, other neurochemical systems, notably cholecystokinin (CCK), are known to affect food intake. We pretreated rats systemically with tropisetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, alone and combined with antagonists of CCKA and CCKB receptors, and measured intake of an IMB. Devazepide, a CCKA receptor antagonist, appeared to interact with tropisetron in the anorectic responses to IMB, blunting the usual remediation of IMB anorexia by tropisetron. The CCKA receptor antagonist, L-365, 260, increased intake of both IMB and an amino acid-balanced basal diet (BAS) and did not interact with tropisetron. Our data suggest that activation of CCKA receptors is interactive with 5-HT3 receptor activity in mediating IMB anorexia in the aminoprivic feeding model. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.
