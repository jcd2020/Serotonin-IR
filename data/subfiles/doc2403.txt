	The 5-HT1B receptor has attracted significant interest as a potential target for the development of therapeutics for the treatment of affective disorders such as anxiety and depression. Here we present the in vivo characterisation of a novel. selective and orally bioavailable 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, SB-616234-A (1-[6-(cis-3,5-dimethylpiperazin-1-yl)-2.3-dihydro-5-methoxyindol-1-yl]-1-[2 '-methyl-4-(5-methly-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methanone hydrochloride). SB-616234-A reversed the 5-HT1/7 receptor agonist. SKF-99101H-induced hypothermia in guinea pigs in a dose related manner with an ED50 of 2.4 mg/kg p.o. Using in vivo microdialysis in freely moving guinea pigs. SB-616234-A (3-30 mg/kg p.o.) caused a dose-related increase in extracellular 5-HT in the dentate gyrus. Evaluation of antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects of this 5-HT1B receptor antagonist was performed in a variety of models and species. SB-616234-A produced a decrease ill immobility time in the mouse forced swim test; an effect suggestive of antidepressant activity. Furthermore. SB-616234-A produced dose-related anxiolytic effects ED50 of 1.0 and 3.3 mg/kg i.p.. respectively (vs fluoxetine in both rat and guinea pig maternal sepalation-induced vocalisation models with an treatment ED50 = 2.2 mg/kg i.p. in both species). Also a significant reduction ill Posturing behaviours was observed in the human threat test ill marmosets; an effect indicative of anxiolytic activity. In summary. SB-616234-A is a novel. potent and orally bioavailable 5-HT1B receptor antagonist which exhibits a neurochemical and behavioural profile that is consistent with both anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like activity in a variety of species. Taken together these data suggest that SB-616234-A may have therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of affective disorders. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
