	Some types of schizophrenia have been associated with repetitive movements lacking specific purpose, also known as stereotyped behavior. Dopamine agonists (D-2) and noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists (e. g. ketamine) have been administered in rodent models to induce stereotyped behavior that resembles some motor symptoms of schizophrenia. Recently, a relationship has been found between 5-HT6 receptors (5-HT6Rs) and dopaminergic activity. The present study evaluates the effect of ketamine (5 and 10 mg/kg), alone and in combination with the 5-HT6R agonist E-6837, on the climbing behavior of male mice. Ketamine was administered with an acute (1 day) and subchronic (5 day) scheme. Later, these doses and schemes were combined with an acute scheme of E-6837 (5 and 10 mg/kg). With both the acute and the subchronic schemes, ketamine increased climbing behavior at a dose of 10 mg/kg, and this effect was reversed by E-6837 (at 5 and 10 mg/kg). The present results suggest that there is an interaction between N-methyl-D-aspartate and 5-HT6 receptors in the regulation of climbing behavior. Further research is necessary to provide more evidence on this interaction. Copyright (C) 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.
