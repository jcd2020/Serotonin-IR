	1. Rat hypothalamic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations are transiently sexually differentiated in the second week postpartum (pp), with higher levels in the female. In this report we investigate the possibility that 5-HT receptors may also exhibit sexual dimorphism in the neonatal period. 2. 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors were quantitated by radioligand binding of [3H]ketanserin and [3H]8-OH DPAT, respectively, in hypothalamus and amygdala from male and female rats at days 8-16 pp. 3. There was no sexual dimorphism or change in the density of 5-HT2A binding in hypothalamus or amygdala over days 8-16 pp. There was also no sexual dimorphism of 5-HT1A receptors. 4. There was an increase in 5-HT1A receptor density in both the hypothalamus and the amygdala. In the hypothalamus, but not the amygdala, this increase was interrupted on day 14 by a decrease in 5-HT1A receptors, which we suggest may be of physiological significance in modifying the eventual pattern of adult agonistic activity. 5. The results suggest that the sexual dimorphism in 5-HT turnover is predominantly presynaptic, relating to altered synthesis and/or release, and is not of sufficient magnitude or duration to produce adaptive responses in postsynaptic 5-HT1A or 5-HT2A receptors.
