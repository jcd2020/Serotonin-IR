	1. Clonazepam is one of the most potent benzodiazepines known to decrease the activity of the central serotonergic systems. The acute and subchronic administration of clonazepam reduced serotonin (5HT) turnover rate in the hippocampus of the rat, as determined by the ratio of the monoamine and its metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. 2. The modulation of 5HT binding sites and 5HT1A receptors by the administration of clonazepam for various periods of time were studied in the hippocampus and the raphe area by experiments with radioligands. 3. The density of [3H]5HT recognition sites increased in the hippocampus of clonazepam-treated rats in a dose- and time-dependent manner. This increase was impaired by the simultaneous administration of the 5HT agonist 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine. The affinity of this binding did not significantly change. This observation might indicate an increase in some of the 5HT receptors or an increase of the uptake site. 4. The binding parameters for [3H]DPAT, Bmax and Kd, decreased in the hippocampus but not in the raphe area of clonazepam-treated rats. It seems that the presynaptic reduction in 5HT function, resulting in the decrease of its availability at the synaptic space, modifies the corresponding 5HT recognition sites. 5. These changes could be related to the anxyolitic activity or the withdrawal symptoms of benzodiazepines.
