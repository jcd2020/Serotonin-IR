Hideshima, K. S., et al. (2018). "Role of mGlu2 in the 5-HT(2A) receptor-dependent antipsychotic activity of clozapine in mice." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 235(11): 3149-3165.

	BACKGROUND: Serotonin 5-HT(2A) and metabotropic glutamate 2 (mGlu2) are neurotransmitter G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in the signaling mechanisms underlying psychosis and schizophrenia treatment. Previous findings in mGlu2 knockout (KO) mice suggested that mGlu2 is necessary for head-twitch behavior, a rodent phenotype characteristic of hallucinogenic 5-HT(2A) receptor agonists. However, the role of mGlu2 in the behavioral effects induced by antipsychotic drugs remains poorly understood. Here, we tested antipsychotic-like behavioral phenotypes induced by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in mGlu2-KO mice and wild-type control littermates. METHODS: Locomotor activity was tested in mGlu2-KO mice and control littermates injected (i.p.) with clozapine (1.5 mg/kg) or vehicle followed by MK801 (0.5 mg/kg), PCP (7.5 mg/kg), amphetamine (6 mg/kg), scopolamine (2 mg/kg), or vehicle. Using a virally (HSV) mediated transgene expression approach, the role of frontal cortex mGlu2 in the modulation of MK801-induced locomotor activity by clozapine treatment was also evaluated. RESULTS: The effect of clozapine on hyperlocomotor activity induced by the dissociative drugs MK801 and phencyclidine (PCP) was decreased in mGlu2-KO mice as compared to controls. Clozapine treatment, however, reduced hyperlocomotor activity induced by the stimulant drug amphetamine and the deliriant drug scopolamine in both wild-type and mGlu2-KO mice. Virally mediated over-expression of mGlu2 in the frontal cortex of mGlu2-KO mice rescued the ability of clozapine to reduce MK801-induced hyperlocomotion. CONCLUSION: These findings further support the existence of a functionally relevant crosstalk between 5-HT(2A) and mGlu2 receptors in different preclinical models of antipsychotic activity.
