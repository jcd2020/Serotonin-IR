	Serotonin research has resulted in the identification of up to 14 receptors in the brain. A real challenge is to develop experimental strategies and methods that can be used to investigate the role of these receptors in the integrated function of the serotonergic systems in the animal and human brain in vivo. There are now methods available that can measure in vivo functional changes in extracellular serotonin (microdialysis, voltammetry). However, with microdialysis temporal and spatial resolution is limited, and while voltammetry has the capability to improve on both these limitations, development of suitable readily usable electrodes is still required. The serotonin transporter and some serotonin receptors can be monitored using positron emission tomography (PET), but work is still required to develop new and better ligands for other receptors. Tryptophan depletion studies can be effectively used to investigate altered serotonergic function in subjects with an underlying trait dysfunction, though its ability to be used to investigate the role of serotonin in normal function remains debatable. Magnetic resonance imaging techniques, in particular fMRI combined with selective pharmacological interventions, offer an exciting new approach to investigating the interactions between serotonin pathways and other neurotransmitters in integrated behavioral responses.
