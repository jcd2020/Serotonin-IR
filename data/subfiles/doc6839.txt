	Epilepsy is a syndrome of episodic brain dysfunction characterized by recurrent unpredictable, spontaneous seizures. Cerebellar dysfunction is a recognized complication of temporal lobe epilepsy and it is associated with seizure generation, motor deficits and memory impairment. Serotonin is known to exert a modulatory action on cerebellar function through 5HT(2C) receptors. 5-HT2C receptors are novel targets for developing anticonvulsant drugs. In the present study, we investigated the changes in the 5-HT2C receptors binding and gene expression in the cerebellum of control, epileptic and Bacopa monnieri treated epileptic rats. There was a significant down regulation of the 5-HT content (p < 0.001), 5-HT2C gene expression (p < 0.001) and 5-HT2C receptor binding (p < 0.001) with an increased affinity (p < 0.001). Carbamazepine and B. monnieri treatments to epileptic rats reversed the down regulated 5-HT content (p < 0.01), 5-HT2C receptor binding (p < 0.001) and gene expression (p < 0.01) to near control level. Also, the Rotarod test confirms the motor dysfunction and recovery by B. monnieri treatment. These data suggest the neuroprotective role of B. monnieri through the upregulation of 5-HT2C receptor in epileptic rats. This has clinical significance in the management of epilepsy.
