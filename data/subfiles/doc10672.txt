Reboucas, E. C. C., et al. (2005). "Effect of the blockade of mu(1)-opioid and 5HT(2A)-serotonergic/alpha(1)-noradrenergic receptors on sweet-substance-induced analgesia." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 179(2): 349-355.

	Rationale: Sweet-substance-induced analgesia has been widely studied, and the investigation of the neurotransmitters involved in this antinociceptive process is an important way for understanding the involvement of the neural system controlling this kind of antinociception. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of opioid and monoaminergic systems in sweet-substance-induced analgesia. Methods: The present work was carried out in an animal model with the aim of investigating whether acute (24 h) or chronic (14 days) intake of a sweet substance, such as sucrose (250 g/l), is followed by antinociception. Tail withdrawal latencies in the tail-flick test were measured before and immediately after this treatment. Immediately after the recording of baseline values, independent groups of rats were submitted to sucrose or tap-water intake and, after chronic treatment, they were pretreated with intraperitoneal administration of (1) naltrexone at 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg; (2) naloxonazine at 5, 10, 20 or 30 mg/kg; (3) methysergide at 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg; (4) ketanserin at 0.5, 1, 2 or 3 mg/kg; or (5) physiological saline. Results: Naltrexone and methysergide at two major doses decreased sweet-substance-induced analgesia after chronic intake of a sweet substance. These effects were corroborated by peripheral administration of naloxonazine and ketanserin. Conclusions: These data give further evidence for: (a) the involvement of endogenous opioids and a mu(1)-opioid receptor in the sweet-substance-induced antinociception; (b) the involvement of monoamines and 5HT(2A) serotonergic/alpha(1)-noradrenergic receptors in the central regulation of the sweet-substance-produced analgesia.
