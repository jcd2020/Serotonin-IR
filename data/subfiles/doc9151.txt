Nair, S. G. and G. A. Gudelsky (2005). "3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) enhances the release of acetylcholine by 5-HT4 and D1 receptor mechanisms in the rat prefrontal cortex." Synapse 58(4): 229-235.

	3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an amphetamine analog, has been shown recently to increase the release of acetylcholine (ACh) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The present study further characterizes the stimulatory effect of MDMA on cortical ACh release and examines the role of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) receptors in this response. The extracellular concentration of ACh was increased dose-dependently and similarly by the (+) and (-) enantiomers of MDMA (5 and 20 mg/kg, i.p.). The systemic administration of the 5-HT(4) antagonist SDZ 205,557 (1 mg/kg, i.p.), but not the 5-HT(2A/2B/2C) antagonist LY-53,857 (3 mg/kg, i.p.), significantly decreased cortical ACh release induced by MDMA. The MDMA-induced increase in the extracellular concentration of ACh also was significantly blunted in rats treated with the D(1) receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.). The extent to which the coadministration of SDZ 205,557 and SCH 23390 suppressed the MDMA-induced release of ACh in the PFC was no greater than that produced by either antagonist alone. These results suggest that the 5-HT(4) and D(1) receptor subtypes contribute to the mechanism by which MDMA increases ACh release in the PFC.
