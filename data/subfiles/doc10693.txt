Strother, W. N., et al. (2003). "Regional CNS densities of serotonin 1A and dopamine D2 receptors in periadolescent alcohol-preferring P and alcohol-nonpreferring NP rat pups." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 74(2): 335-342.

	The objective of the present study was to use quantitative autoradiography to determine binding densities of serotonin(1A) (5-HT(1A)) and dopamine (DA) D(2) receptors in alcohol-naive periadolescent P and NP rat pups. P (n=8) and NP (n=7) rat pups, 25 days of age, from different litters were used. Coronal brain sections were incubated with 2 nM [3H]8-OH-DPAT or 20 nM [3H]sulpiride for 5-HT(1A) or D(2) binding, respectively. Approximately 15-40% higher densities of [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding were observed in the anterior cortical regions of the periadolescent P rat compared with NP rat pups. Similar differences were also observed in posterior cortical regions with P rats having 25-40% higher [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding than NP rats. [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding was approximately 10-20% higher in posterior hippocampal regions of the P rat pups compared with the NP line. [3H]sulpiride binding was significantly different only in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), where binding was approximately 20% lower in the periadolescent P rats compared with the NP rat pups. Overall, these results are very similar to findings observed in adult alcohol-naive P and NP rats, and suggest that the innate differences in the neural systems implicated in high alcohol drinking behaviors may already be established in the periadolescent animal.
