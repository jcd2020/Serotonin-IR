Rumajogee, P., et al. (2006). "Somato-dendritic distribution of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors in the BDNF- and cAMP-differentiated RN46A serotoninergic raphe cell line." Brain Res 1085(1): 121-126.

	The rapid differentiating effects of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or dibutyryl-cAMP (dBcAMP) were characterized on RN46A, a rat raphe-derived neuronal cell line. After BDNF treatment, RN46A cells were serotonin-immunopositive and bipolar, and expressed the microtubule-associated-protein 2 (Map2). After dBcAMP treatment, the cells often became multipolar, bearing very long processes strongly immunopositive for serotonin and Map2. Under both conditions, the expression and distribution of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors remained identical. 5-HT(1A) and Map2 immunolabelings were superimposable, as expected of their somato-dendritic targeting. Surprisingly, the distribution of 5-HT(1B) immunoreactivity was similar, in contrast with its usual localization in axons and nerve terminals in the brain. In conclusion, both BDNF and cAMP-differentiated RN46A cells towards a neuronal serotoninergic-like phenotype without the typical differential targeting of the 5-HT(1) autoreceptors, an interesting model to study the molecular mechanisms ensuing the targeting of 5-HT(1) autoreceptors to somas and dendrites.
