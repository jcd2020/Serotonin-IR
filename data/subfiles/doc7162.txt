Mbaki, Y., et al. (2012). "5-HT2A receptor activation of the external urethral sphincter and 5-HT2C receptor inhibition of micturition: A study based on pharmacokinetics in the anaesthetized female rat." European Journal of Pharmacology 682(1-3): 142-152.

	Central and peripheral 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors play a critical role in the regulation of micturition. Bolus doses of 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists have been shown to activate the external urethral sphincter (EUS) and to inhibit micturition. This study was designed to determine the contribution of these two 5-HT receptor subtypes to activation of the EUS and inhibition of micturition utilising pharmacokinetic knowledge to better control drug exposure. Recordings of urethral and bladder pressure, EUS-Electromyogram (EMG), the micturition reflex induced by bladder filling, blood pressure and heart rate were made in anaesthetized female rats. The effects of intravenous (iv.) infusions of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist (2S)-1-(6-chloro-5-fluoroindol-1-yl)propan-2-amine fumarate (Ro 60-0175) in the absence or presence of the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist 6-chloro-5-methyl-N-[6-(2-methylpyrindin-3-yl)oxypyrindin-3-yl]-2,3-dihydroindole-1-carboxamide dihydrochloride (SB 242084) or 5-HT2A receptor antagonist (R)-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-[1-[2-(4-fluorophenyl) ethyl]piperidin-4-yl]methanol (MDL-100,907) were studied on these variables. Continuous infusion of increasing concentrations of Ro 60-0175 only evoked EUS-EMG activity at the highest concentration, which was blocked by co-infusion of MDL-100,907 but not SB 242084. Urethral pressure was unaffected by any drug infusion. Ro 60-0175 at the lowest concentration inhibited the micturition reflex but as the concentration increased this was reversed to facilitation. SB 242084 blocked the inhibition while MDL-100,907 blocked the excitation. Activation of 5-HT2A not 5-HT2C receptors evoked EUS-EMG activity. In conclusion, 5-HT2A receptor activation facilitated the micturition reflex and evoked EUS-EMG while 5-HT2C receptor activation only inhibited the micturition reflex. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.
