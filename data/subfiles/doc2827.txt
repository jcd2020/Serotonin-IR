Duman, R. S. (2007). "A silver bullet for the treatment of depression?" Neuron 55(5): 679-681.

	The search for a rapid-acting antidepressant has been a subject of intense research interest for several decades. The article by Lucas and colleagues in this issue of Neuron provides compelling evidence from preclinical animal models that drugs acting at the serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor could finally achieve this goal. However, caution is warranted, as results from animal studies are not always predictive of therapeutic actions in humans.
