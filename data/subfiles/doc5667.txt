Humblot, N., et al. (1998). The serotonergic system modulates the cocaine-induced expression of the immediate early genes egr-1 and c-fos in rat brain. Neurochemistry of Drugs of Abuse: Cocaine, Ibogaine, and Substituted Amphetamines. S. F. Ali. New York, New York Acad Sciences. 844: 7-20.

	Transcription regulatory factors are rapidly induced in brain by a wide variety of stimuli and may be important in coordinating changes in gene expression underlying neuronal plasticity. Using irt situ hybridization,,ve found that acute cocaine administration (20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) produced a robust induction of both c-fos and egr-1 immediate early genes. Egr-1 messenger RNA induction was highest in the caudate putamen and in the shell of the nucleus accumbens. No significant induction was noticed after injection of fluoxetine, a selective inhibitor of serotonin uptake. Cocaine-induced egr-1 and c-fos expression was substantially reduced in the brain areas from rats in which the serotonergic projections were lesioned by injection of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, and in rats that have been injected with tropisetron, an antagonist of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3) receptor, Conversely, the 5-HT3, receptor agonist 2-methyl-serotonin induced the expression of these early genes in structures including the caudate putamen and nucleus accumbens.
