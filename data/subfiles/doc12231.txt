Strosznajder, J., et al. (1994). "Aging diminishes serotonin-stimulated arachidonic acid uptake and cholinergic receptor-activated arachidonic acid release in rat brain cortex membrane." J Neurochem 62(3): 1048-1054.

	Synaptoneurosomal and synaptosomal fractions from the brain cortex of adult (4-month-old) and aged (27-month-old) rats were used for studies on the uptake and subsequent release of [14C]arachidonic acid ([14C]AA) from brain lipids. The incorporation of AA and the pattern of its uptake into lipids of the aged brain cortex synaptoneurosomes and synaptosomes were not significantly different when compared with those in the adult brain cortex fractions. Serotonin (5-HT), at 10 microM to 1 mM in the presence of pargyline and the agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor, buspirone, stimulated AA uptake into membrane lipids, mainly into phosphatidylinositol, by about 40% exclusively in adult brain synaptoneurosomes. Aging significantly diminished the effect of 5-HT on AA uptake. Synaptoneurosomal and synaptosomal fractions prelabeled with [14C]AA were used subsequently for investigation of voltage-dependent, muscarinic and 5-HT receptor-mediated AA release. Aging diminished markedly carbachol-stimulated Ca(2+)-dependent AA liberation from membrane lipids of synaptoneurosomes and synaptosomes. Moreover, aging decreased voltage-dependent and 5-HT2 receptor-mediated AA release. These results show that aging affects receptor-dependent AA uptake and pre- and postsynaptic receptor-mediated AA release. These modulations of AA incorporation and release in aged brain may be of pathophysiological significance, in view of the importance of these processes for signal transmission in the brain. The changes of receptor-dependent processes of deacylation and reacylation may be responsible for alteration in the function of neuronal cells and may affect learning and memory ability and brain plasticity during aging.
