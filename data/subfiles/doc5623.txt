	Serotonergic transmission is terminated by serotonin transporter (SERT)-mediated uptake following activation of serotonin receptors, several subtypes of which are present in the medial nucleus of the solitary tract (mNTS) at the area postrema level. In this region, serotonin (5HT) is a major modulator of the baroreceptor reflex and also affects gastric motility. This serotonin is derived from multiple sources including local neurons and inputs from raphe and visceral vagal afferents. To determine the relevant functional sites for serotonin uptake in the mNTS, we examined the electron microscopic localization of SERTs using both immunoperoxidase and immunogold labeling in rat brain. In addition, we combined these methods for dual labeling of SERTs and 5HT2A receptors to detect whether the SERT in this region was located near or at a distance from the sites of activation of these G-protein coupled receptors. Intensive SERT immunolabeling was seen on plasma membranes of axons and morphologically heterogeneous axon terminals that formed symmetric or asymmetric synapses on dendrites without detectable 5HT2A immunoreactivity (IR). 5HT2A-IR was, however, located in other nearby neuronal and glial profiles, some of which apposed intensively SERT-labeled terminals or terminals containing lower intensity of SERT immunolabeling. In somatodendritic profiles, co-expression of SERT and 5HT2A receptor immunolabeling was seen near synapses and Golgi lamellae. Our results suggest that in the mNTS 5HT activates 5HT2A receptors at a distance from SERT-mediated uptake sites in diverse cell types including some that express both 5HT2A receptors and SERTs.
