Petty, M. A., et al. (1997). "The selectivity of MDL 74,721 in models of neurogenic versus vascular components of migraine." Eur J Pharmacol 336(2-3): 127-136.

	MDL 74,721 (R)-2-(N1,N1-dipropylamino)-8-methylaminosulfonylmethyl-1,2,3,4-te trahydronaphthalene, a sulfonamidotetralin, has been found to exhibit a 10,000-fold greater potency in neurogenic versus vascular models of migraine. Sumatriptan, a relatively pure 5-HT1D/5-HT1B receptor agonist, also showed higher potency versus neurogenic inflammation. However, for sumatriptan the potency difference (100-fold) in the two pathophysiological models was less pronounced than seen for MDL 74,721. The affinity profile of MDL 74,721 at 5-HT1 receptor subtypes may in part explain its ability to differentiate these two physiological responses. MDL 74,721 demonstrated nanomolar affinity for 5-HT1A (12.7 +/- 0.3 nM) and 5-HT1D (41.3 +/- 10.9 nM) but considerably lower affinity for 5-HT1B receptors (> 1000 nM). Serotonin-like activity was seen in in vitro functional assays including inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in human 5-HT1D receptor-transfected fibroblasts or eliciting vasoconstriction in isolated human pial arteries. The intrinsic activity (relative to 5 - HT[E(Amax)]) and affinity (pD2) for the human cerebrovascular 5-HT receptors were: 5-HT (100%, 7.51 +/- 0.09), sumatriptan (94%, 6.85 +/- 0.1) and MDL 74,721 (66%, 5.70 +/- 0.23). In anaesthetised cats, treatment with MDL 74,721 resulted in a dose-related reduction in the percentage of carotid flow going through the arteriovenous anastomoses to the lungs, with an ED50 of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., the same as sumatriptan. However, in the guinea-pig neurogenic model, MDL 74,721 inhibited plasma protein extravasation with an ED50 of 0.023 microg/kg compared to 2.5 microg/kg for sumatriptan. MDL 74,721 was also effective in this model (in rats) after oral administration. In conclusion, MDL 74,721 demonstrates a preclinical profile consistent with anti-migraine efficacy. Its marked preference for inhibiting neurogenic inflammation makes this compound a useful tool for assessing the relative contribution of this pathophysiological mechanism to the human disease state.
