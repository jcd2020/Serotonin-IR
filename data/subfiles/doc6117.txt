Johnson, K. W., et al. (2003). "Neurogenic dural protein extravasation induced by meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) involves nitric oxide and 5-HT2B receptor activation." Cephalalgia 23(2): 117-123.

	The compound m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), which is known to trigger migraine-like head pain in some subjects, was evaluated for its ability to induce dural plasma protein extravasation (PPE) in guinea pigs. Intravenous mCPP dose-dependently increased PPE. This effect was inhibited by non-selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonists (methysergide, LY53857, LY215840), by a peripherally restricted 5-HT2 receptor antagonist (xylamidine) and by a 5-HT2B selective receptor antagonist (LY202146). These data suggests that peripheral 5-HT2B receptors mediate mCPP-induced PPE. The nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-NAME and 5-HT1 agonist sumatriptan also blocked mCPP-induced PPE, suggesting a role for nitric oxide (NO) and the trigeminal system, respectively. NO release has been linked to activation of the 5-HT2B receptor on the vascular endothelium. However, LY202146 did not block PPE induced by electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. These data are consistent with activation of peripheral 5-HT2B receptors initiating PPE and the theory that selective 5-HT2B antagonists might be effective prophylactic therapies for migraine.
