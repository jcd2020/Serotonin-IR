	The present study demonstrated the antidepressant-like effect of neurosteroid 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one (3 alpha, 5 alpha THP) in mouse forced swim test of depression and its modulation by different serotonergic agents. Pretreatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, i.p.), the 5-HT releaser, fenfluramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), the 5-HT1B/1C receptor agonist, TFMPP (4 mg/kg, s.c.) and the 5-HT2A/1C receptor agonist, DOI (2 mg/kg, s.c.) potentiated the antidepressant-like effect of 3 alpha, 5 alpha THP. At these doses the serotonergic agents per se did not modify the duration of immobility. However, fluoxetine (20 mg/kg, i.p.), fenfluramine (20 mg/kg, i.p.) or imipramine (5 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.) not only reduced immobility bur also enhanced the antidepressant-like effect of 3 alpha, 5 alpha THP. Such a potentiating effect of the 5-HT1A or the 5-HT2A/1C receptor agonist was not antagonized by the sub-effective dose (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.) of their respective antagonists p-MPPI or ketanserin. Pretreatment with p-CPA (300x3 mg/kg, i.p.), a depicter of 5-HT neuronal store failed to block the influence of fluoxetine and fenfluramine on antidepressant-like effect of 3 alpha, 5 alpha THP. The accelerated effect of 3 alpha, 5 alpha THP in presence of serotonergic agents was antagonized by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist, bicuculline (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or the 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase enzyme inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mg/kg, i.p.). These findings for the first time demonstrate that serotonergic agents potentiate the antidepressant-like action of 3 alpha, 5 alpha THP, by enhancing the GABAergic tone as a likely consequence of increased brain content of this neurosteroid.
