	Ghrelin microinjections into discrete regions of the hypothalamus including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) stimulate eating and promote carbohydrate oxidation effects similar to PVN microinjection of neuropeptide Y (NPY) We have also reported that NPY s orexigenic and metabolic effects are antagonized by pretreatment with 5-hydroxyeryptamine (5 HT) or 5-HT receptor agonises In order to determine whether 5-HT also inhibits ghrelin s orexigenic and metabolic actions the present study examined the effects of 5-HT pretreatment on ghrelin-induced alterations in eating and energy substrate utilization following direct injections into the hypothalamic PVN Both 5-HT (5-20 nmol) and ghrelin (100 pmol) were administered at the onset of the dark cycle Food Intake was measured 2 h postinjection A separate group of rats (n = 8) was injected with 5-HT paired with ghrelin and respiratory quotient (RQ, VCO2/VO2) was measured over 2 h using an open circuit calorimeter PVN injections of ghrelin increased food intake and Increased RQ reflecting a shift in energy substrate utilization in favor of carbohydrate oxidation 5 HT effectively blocked the effects of ghrelin on both food intake and RQ We then administered the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonise DOI immediately prior to ghrelin Similar to 5-HT PVN DOI blocked ghrelin induced eating and inhibited the peptide s effect on substrate utilization These data are in agreement with other evidence suggesting that ghrelin functions as a gut brain peptide in the control of food intake and energy metabolism and indicate that 5 HT acts within the PVN to modulate ghrelin s orexigenic and metabolic signaling (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved
