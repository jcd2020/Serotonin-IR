Mos, J., et al. (1997). "The putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonist DU125530 blocks the discriminative stimulus of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan in pigeons." Eur J Pharmacol 325(2-3): 145-153.

	Twelve homing pigeons were trained to discriminate the 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) from its vehicle in a fixed ratio (FR) 30 two-key operant drug discrimination procedure. Tests for generalization and antagonism showed that compounds with agonistic action at the 5-HT1A receptor, such as 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin) buspirone and ipsapirone all substituted for the flesinoxan cue. Compounds with mixed agonistic action at the 5-HT1A/1B receptor fully (eltoprazine) or partially (RU24969 (5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl-1H-indole)) substituted for flesinoxan. TFMPP (1-(3-trifluoromethyl phenyl)piperazine) and mCPP(1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine), both acting at the 5-HT1B/2C receptor, did not substitute for flesinoxan, neither did the selective 5-HT re-uptake inhibitor fluvoxamine. The results of the antagonism tests showed that the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists NAN-190 (1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butly]piperazine), WAY 100635 ((N-[2-[4-(2-methaxyphenyl)- 1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclo-hexane-carboxamide) and the newly developed DU125530 (2-[4-[4-(7-chloro-2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-5-yl)- 1-piperazinyl]butyl]-1,2-benzisothiazol-3(2H)-one-1,1-dioxide) fully (more than 80%) blocked the flesinoxan cue without having substantial effects when given alone. WAY100135 (N-tert-butyl-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl)-2-phenylpropanamide), (+/-)-pindolol and (S)-UH-301 ((S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)-tetralin all partially antagonized the flesinoxan cue. However, both WAY100135 as well as (+/-)-pindolol also partially substituted for flesinoxan in generalization tests. NAN190, (S)-UH-301, WAY100635 and DU125530 were without any activity in the generalization test at the doses tested. The putative 5-HT1A receptor antagonist S15535 (4-benzodioxan-5-yl) 1-(indan-2-yl)piperazine) was identified as a full agonist in the present procedure. Taken together these results suggest that the flesinoxan cue in pigeons is mediated by the 5-HT1A receptor and that DU125530 acts as a full antagonist on the 5-HT1A receptor.
