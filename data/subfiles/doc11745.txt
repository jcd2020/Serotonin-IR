	We evaluated the impact of conditioned stress on outflow of dopamine in the rat prefrontal cortex. Exposure of rats to an environment associated with aversive stimuli-foot shock enhanced outflow of dopamine in a similar way as seen during the conditioning session when foot shocks were applied. Diazepam (2.5 and 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently decreased outflow of dopamine and, when given in a dose of 10 mg/kg, but not 2.5 mg/kg, decreased enhanced dopamine outflow evoked by conditioned stress. On the other hand, ipsapirone (10 mg/kg, but not 2.5 mg/kg) and buspirone (2.5 mg/kg) enhanced basal outflow of dopamine. When ipsapirone (10 mg/kg) and buspirone (2.5 mg/kg) were given to rats exposed to conditioned stress, the stress-evoked elevation in dopamine outflow was abolished. Ipsapirone in a dose of 2.5 mg/kg was ineffective in the stress paradigm tested. It is concluded that conditioned stress in vivo enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission in the rat prefrontal cortex, this effect being attenuated by diazepam, a classic anxiolytic drug, and by such novel anxiolytics as ipsapirone and buspirone, which operate via serotonergic 5-HT1A receptors. Although ipsapirone and buspirone blocked stress-induced enhancement of dopamine outflow, this effect seems to result from their influence on the basal outflow of dopamine. Differential effects of diazepam and 5-HT1A agonists on basal and stress-induced alterations in dopamine outflow are discussed in terms of their possible effectiveness in various types of general anxiety disorders.
