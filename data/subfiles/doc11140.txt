Saadat, K. S., et al. (2005). "The role of 5-HT in the impairment of thermoregulation observed in rats administered MDMA ('ecstasy') when housed at high ambient temperature." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 179(4): 884-890.

	Administration to rats of a neurotoxic dose of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) produces an impairment in thermoregulation which is reflected in a prolonged hyperthermic response to a subsequent dose of MDMA given to rats housed at high ambient temperature. We wished to examine whether the impaired thermoregulation was associated with decreased cerebral 5-HT content produced by the prior neurotoxic dose of MDMA. Rats were injected with drugs decreasing 5-HT function [the tryptophan hydroxlase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), and 5-HT receptor antagonists] and rectal temperature was measured after administering MDMA to rats housed at 30 degrees C. Results PCPA pretreatment decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA concentrations in cortex, hippocampus and striatum by > 80% and prolonged the hyperthermia induced in rats housed at 30 degrees C by administering MDMA (5 mg/kg i.p.). A similar prolongation of the hyperthermic response to MDMA was seen when rats were pretreated with methysergide (10 mg/kg i.p.) or the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg s.c.). Decreasing 5-HT function in diverse ways enhanced the hyperthermic response to MDMA given to rats housed at high ambient temperature. This suggests that loss of 5-HT acting on 5-HT1A receptors leads to impaired thermoregulation in rats and suggests that the impairment seen in MDMA pretreated rats housed at high ambient temperature is due to a loss in 5-HT function. These data could have implications for recreational users of MDMA, who may have damaged serotoninergic neurons because of prior heavy or frequent use of the drug, when taking further doses of MDMA in hot environments such as dance clubs.
