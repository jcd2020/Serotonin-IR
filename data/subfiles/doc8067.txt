Neumaier, J. F., et al. (2000). "Corticosteroids regulate 5-HT(1A) but not 5-HT(1B) receptor mRNA in rat hippocampus." Brain Res Mol Brain Res 82(1-2): 65-73.

	The role of mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors (MR and GR, respectively) in the regulation of serotonin receptors has not been clearly delineated. There is no consensus regarding the regulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors, and corticosteroid regulation of 5-HT(1B) mRNA has not been previously studied. We compared the effects of long-term (two week) adrenalectomy (no MR or GR activation) and several hormone replacement protocols designed to stimulate MR selectively (ALDO), MR and GR (HCT), and continuous MR with cyclical GR activation (SHAM adrenalectomy). 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) mRNAs were measured by in situ hybridization in hippocampus and raphe nuclei. None of the experimental manipulations altered 5-HT(1B) mRNA levels in the hippocampus or dorsal raphe, and also had no effect on 5-HT(1A) mRNA in dorsal or median raphe. However, 5-HT(1A) mRNA levels were regulated in a complex manner in the different subfields of hippocampus. We conclude that both MR and GR play an integrated role in regulating 5-HT(1A) mRNA levels in hippocampus while having no effect on 5-HT(1B) mRNA levels under these conditions.
