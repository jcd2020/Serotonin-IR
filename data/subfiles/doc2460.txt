de Freitas, R. L., et al. (2016). "The μ(1)-opioid receptor and 5-HT(2A)- and 5HT(2C)-serotonergic receptors of the locus coeruleus are critical in elaborating hypoalgesia induced by tonic and tonic-clonic seizures." Neuroscience 336: 133-145.

	It has been proposed that the post-ictal state is associated with the expression of hypoalgesia. It is clear that the projections among the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and locus coeruleus (LC) play a role in pain management. These mesencephalic structures have direct reciprocal opioid and monoaminergic projections to the LC that can possibly modulate post-ictal hypoalgesia. The goal of this study was to examine if LC-opioid and serotonergic/noradrenergic mechanisms signal the post-ictal hypoalgesic responses to tonic-clonic seizures produced by intraperitoneal administration of pentylenetetrazole (PTZ at 64mg/kg), causing an ionophore γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated Cl(-) influx antagonism. The rodents' nociceptive threshold was measured by the tail-flick test. Intra-LC cobalt chloride (1.0nM/0.2μL) microinjections produced intermittent local synaptic inhibition and were able to reduce post-ictal hypoalgesia. Central administration of naltrexone (a non-selective antagonist for opioid receptors), naloxonazine (a selective antagonist for μ(1)-opioid-receptors), methysergide (a non-selective antagonist for serotonergic receptors) or ketanserin (an antagonist for both α(1)-noradrenergic and 5-Hydroxytryptamine(HT)(2A/2C) receptors) at 5.0μg/0.2μL, R-96544 (a 5-HT(2A) receptor selective antagonist) at 10nM/0.2μL, or RS-102221 (a 5-HT(2C) receptor selective antagonist) at 0.15μg/0.2μL into the LC also decreased post-ictal hypoalgesia. The data presented here suggest that the post-ictal antinociception mechanism involves the μ(1)-opiod, 5-HT(2A)- and 5-HT(2C)-serotonergic, and α(1)-noradrenergic receptors in the LC.
