	The ionic channels and signal transduction pathways underlying the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced hyperpolarization in neurons of the rat dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) were examined by using intracellular and voltage-clamp recording techniques. Application of 5-HT (1-50 microM) caused a hyperpolarizing response associated with a decreased membrane resistance in DLSN neurons. The hyperpolarization induced by 5-HT was blocked by Ba2+ (1 mM) but not by tetraethylammonium (TEA, 3 mM), glibenclamide (100 microM) and extracellular Cs+ (2 mM). 8-Hydroxy-di-n-propylamino tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 3 microM), a selective agonist for the 5-HT1A receptor, mimicked 5-HT in producing the hyperpolarization. The 5-HT hyperpolarization was blocked by NAN-190 (5 microM), a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. CP93129 (100 microM), a 5-HT1B receptor agonist, and L-694-247 (100 microM), a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, also produced hyperpolarizing responses. The order of agonist potency was 8-OH-DPAT >> CP93129 > or = L-694-247. (+/-)-2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI, 100 microM), a 5-HT2 receptor agonist, and RS67333 (100 microM), a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, caused no hyperpolarizing response. The voltage-clamp study showed that 5-HT caused an outward current (I5-HT) in a concentration-dependent manner. I5-HT was associated with an increased membrane conductance. I5-HT reversed the polarity at the equilibrium potential for K+ calculated by the Nernst equation. I5-HT showed inward rectification at membrane potentials more negative than-70 mV. Ba2+ (100 microM) blocked the inward rectifier K+ current induced by 5-HT. I5-HT was irreversibly depressed by intracellular application of guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)(GTP-gamma S) but not by guanosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) (GDP beta S). These results suggest that in rat DLSN neurons activation of 5-HT1A receptors causes a hyperpolarizing response by activating mainly the inward rectifier K+ channels through a GTP-binding protein.
