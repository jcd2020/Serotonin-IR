Wilson, A. A., et al. (1999). "Analogues of WAY 100635 as radiotracers for in vivo imaging of 5-HT1A receptors." Journal of Labelled Compounds & Radiopharmaceuticals 42(7): 611-620.

	Two diastereoisomeric analogues of the potent 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 have been synthesized and radiolabelled with C-11; namely trans- and cis-N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (3 and 4). Both [C-11]-3 and [C-11]-4 were obtained in modest yields at high specific activities by O-[C-11]-alkylation of their respective alkoxide precursors with [C-11]-iodomethane. The labelled diastereoisomers were isolated by reverse-phase HPLC and isolated as radiochemically pure formulations for in vivo experiments. Biodistribution studies in rats showed moderate brain uptake for [C-11]-4 with little differentiation of uptake between regions rich in 5-HT1A receptors (e.g. hippocampus) and receptor poor regions (e.g. cerebellum). However the diastereoisomeric [C-11]-3 possessed better brain uptake with moderate differentiation between 5-HT1A receptor rich and poor regions at early time points (5-30 min post-injection), The results suggest that [C-11]-3 may have potential as an in vivo imaging agent for 5-HT1A receptors.
