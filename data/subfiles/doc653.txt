Barnes, N. M., et al. (1992). "Profiles of interaction of R(+)/S(-)-zacopride and anxiolytic agents in a mouse model." Eur J Pharmacol 218(1): 91-100.

	The mouse black and white test box was used to measure changes in behaviour in an aversive situation where the administration of R(+)-zacopride (but not S(-)-zacopride) alone decreased aversive responding to the white area. A similar anxiolytic profile of action was observed using parachlorophenylalanine (PCPA), whose effects were antagonised by a co-treatment with R(+)-zacopride and reversed by S(-)-zacopride to an exacerbation of the aversive response. An anxiolytic profile of action was also observed using ondansetron, granisetron, chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, ritanserin, 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), E4424 (2-[4-[4-(4-chloro-l-pyrazoyl)butyl]-l-piperazinyl]-pyrimidine), umepsirone, DuP753 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxy-methyl-1-[2(1H-tetrazol-5-yl) biphenyl-4-yl)methyl)]-imidazole), SQ29,852 ((S)-1-[6-amino-2[hydroxy)(4-phenyl-butyl)phosphinyl]-oxy)-1- nexy]-2-proline), devazepide and guanfacine, and this was retained following co-treatment with PCPA. The anxiolytic profile of action of PCPA was also retained following co-treatment with renzapride which when administered alone failed to modify behaviour. However, the ability of chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, ondansetron and E4424 (but not devazepide, DuP753 or SQ29,852) to reduce aversive responding was inhibited by co-treatment with R(+) and/or S(-)-zacopride. It is concluded that the reduction in aversive responding caused by pharmacological manipulation at the benzodiazepine, 5-HT receptor subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C/5-HT2 and 5-HT3 (but not at the cholecystokin CCKA or angiotensin receptors or inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme) can be inhibited by R(+) and S(-)-zacopride. The data is discussed in terms of zacopride having an agonist or partial agonist effect at the 5-HT3 receptor.
