Meyer, M. D., et al. (1994). "SYNTHESIS AND STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY-RELATIONSHIPS OF CIS- AND TRANS-2,3,4,4A,9,9A-HEXAHYDRO-1H-INDENO 2,1-C PYRIDINES FOR 5-HT RECEPTOR SUBTYPES." Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 37(1): 105-112.

	A series of cis- and trans-fused hexahydroindeno[2,1-c] pyridines have been prepared and evaluated for affinity and selectivity at the 5-HT1A subtype of the serotonin receptor. Using molecular modeling studies we predicted that the 5-methoxy-trans-fused members of this class would exhibit affinity for this site. In agreement with these predictions, trans-5-methoxy-N-propyl 2,3,4,4a,9, 9a-hexahydro-1H-indeno[2,1-c]pyridine (6a) demonstrated moderate affinity and high selectivity for the 5-HT1A binding site, whereas the cis-fused isomer 5a demonstrated virtually no affinity at this site. Additional trans-fused analogs from this series, where the nitrogen was substituted with a variety of alkylene imide containing appendages, demonstrated high (0.60-51 nM) affinity and excellent selectivity for the and HT1A site. Certain of these analogs, independent of ring-fusion stereochemistry, also demonstrated high affinity for the 5-HT2 binding site.
