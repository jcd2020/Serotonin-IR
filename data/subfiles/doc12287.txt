	Tramadol, an atypical opioid analgesic, stimulates both opiatergic and serotonergic systems. Here we have investigated the effect of tramadol in mice on 5-hydroxyptrytophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitch response (HTR), which is an animal model for the activation of the CNS 5-HT2A receptors in mice. Tramadol attenuated 5-HTP-induced HTR in a dose-dependent manner as morphine. Furthermore, the nonselective opioid receptor antagonists, naloxone and diprenorphine (M5050), reversed the effect of tramadol on 5-HTP-induced HTR dose-dependently. Interestingly, in contrast to the selective delta opioid receptor antagonist NTI, beta-FNA, a selective mu opioid receptor antagonist, and nor-BNI, a selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist, antagonized the attenuation of 5-HTP-induced HTR by tramadol. In conclusion, administration of tramadol systemically inhibits 5-HTP-induced HTR in mice by activating opiatergic system in the CNS. Our findings show that g and K opioid receptors, but not 6 opioid receptor, play an important role in the regulation of serotonergic function in the CNS.
