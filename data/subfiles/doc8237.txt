Nonogaki, K., et al. (2009). "Fluvoxamine exerts anorexic effect in 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice with heterozygous mutation of beta-endorphin gene." Int J Neuropsychopharmacol 12(4): 547-552.

	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 2C receptors and the downstream melanocortin pathway are suggested to mediate the anorexic effects of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and fenfluramine. We previously reported that fluvoxamine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, together with pharmacological inactivation of 5-HT2C receptors exert feeding suppression through activation of 5-HT1B receptors in mice. Here, we report that fluvoxamine exerted anorexic effects in 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice with heterozygous mutation of beta-endorphin gene (2CREnd mice), whereas fluvoxamine had no effect on food intake in age-matched wild-type mice and 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice, which are associated with decreases in hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression. mCPP suppressed food intake in 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice, 2CREnd mice and age-matched wild-type mice. These results suggest that fluvoxamine-induced feeding suppression requires a perturbation of 5-HT2C receptor and beta-endorphin signalling plus functional hypothalamic POMC activity, whereas mCPP-induced feeding suppression does not always require functional 5-HT2C receptor, beta-endorphin, and POMC activity in mice.
