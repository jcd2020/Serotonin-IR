Bromek, E., et al. (2019). "Stimulation of 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptor subtype in the hypothalamic arcuate nuclei (ARC) increases the cytochrome P450 activity in the liver." Pharmacol Rep 71(6): 1210-1212.

	BACKGROUND: Our previous study has demonstrated that activation of the 5-HT(2), but not 5-HT(1) serotonin receptor type in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) is responsible for the neuroendocrine regulation of liver cytochrome P450. The goal of these studies was to determine whether 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptor subtype in the ARC is engaged in the regulation of liver cytochrome P450. METHODS: The 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptor agonist CP-809,101 was injected into the ARC for 5 days. The liver cytochrome P450 activity and protein level were measured. RESULTS: In rats receiving an injection of the 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptor agonist CP-809,101 into the ARC (1 μg/side) for five days, the activities of CYP2B, CYP2C11 and CYP3A significantly increased corresponding with the elevated enzyme protein level. CONCLUSIONS: The obtained results suggest that the 5-HT(2C) serotonin receptor subtype in the ARC is involved in the positive neuroendocrine regulation of cytochrome P450. Further studies are in progress to explain the physiological mechanism which is responsible for the observed regulation of cytochrome P450 by 5-HT(2C) receptor present in the ARC.
