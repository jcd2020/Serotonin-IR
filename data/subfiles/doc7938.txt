	Administration of cocaine causes a locomotor stimulant effect and increases extracellular levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) in the brains of rodents. Previous studies show that 5-HT1A receptor agonist and antagonist modify the cocaine-induced behavioral and neurochemical effects in the rats. However, the role of the 5-HT system on the effects of cocaine has not been studied in the prefrontal cortex. The present study examined in ddY-strain male mice the effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist osemozotan and the receptor antagonist WAY100635 on cocaine-induced locomotor stimulant effect and increases in extracellular levels of 5-HT and DA in the prefrontal cortex. The cocaine-induced locomotor stimulant effect was attenuated by osemozotan and enhanced by WAY100635. The cocaine-induced increase in extracellular levels of 5-HT was attenuated by osemozotan, and enhanced by WAY100635. The cocaine-induced increase in extracellular levels of DA was enhanced by osemozotan, but not affected by WAY100635. These results suggest that the prefrontal 5-HT system plays a pivotal role in the locomotor stimulant effect of cocaine in mice. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
