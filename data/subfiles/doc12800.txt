	Previous studies in rats have shown that injection of nanomoles of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) acts on 5HT3 receptors to increase arterial pressure (AP). We investigated the effect of 5HT in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Injection of nanomoles of 5HT into the NTS of chloralose-anesthetized SD rats increased AP. This effect was inhibited by prior injection of 5HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. The GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline did not inhibit the effect of 5HT. Bilateral injection of 5HT or ondansetron did not affect the baroreflex sensitivity. Bilateral injection of ondansetron did not alter AP. The pressor effect of 5HT was exaggerated in SHR. These results suggest that stimulation of 5HT3 receptors in the NTS increases AP independently of activation of GABAA receptors and the baroreflex sensitivity. Furthermore, this serotonergic system is supersensitive in the NTS of SHR.
