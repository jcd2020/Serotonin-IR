	Substantial evidence has accumulated that spinally projecting serotonergic neurons modulate nociception. However, the exact receptor subtypes that mediate the antinociceptive response of serotonin within the spinal cord continue to be a subject of debate. Therefore, we explored the effect of serotonergic system on imipramine induced antinociception by using 5-Hydroxytryptamine-3 (5HT3) receptor antagonist ondansetron and 5-Hydroxytryptamine-2 (5HT2) receptor antagonist mianserine, and depletion of brain 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5HT) with p-chlorophenyl alanine (PCPA). Male wistar strain rats were pretreated with either ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or mianserine (1 mg/kg, i.p.). After 15 minutes, rats received injection of imipramine (10 mg/kg). Nociception was assessed by tail-flick method. Imipramine (2 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg/kg) produce antinociceptive response in the dose dependent manner. Prior treatment with 5HT3 antagonist, Ondansetron and 5HT2 antagonist, mianserine reduce the antinociceptive response of imipramine. In PCPA treated rats imipramine (10 mg/kg) failed to produce antinociception. These results indicate that the 5HT plays an important role in imipramine induced antinociception.
