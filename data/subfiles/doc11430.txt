Varn√§s, K., et al. (2003). "Distribution of 5-HT4 receptors in the postmortem human brain--an autoradiographic study using [125I]SB 207710." Eur Neuropsychopharmacol 13(4): 228-234.

	The autoradiographic distribution of the 5-HT4 receptor was described using human postmortem brain sections and the selective radioligand [125I]SB 207710 [(1-n-butyl-4-piperidinyl)methyl-8-amino-7-[125I]iodo-1,4-benzodioxane-5-carboxylate]. The specific binding was highest in regions of the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, nucleus accumbens, globus pallidus and substantia nigra) and the hippocampal formation (CA1 and subiculum). In the neocortex, the binding showed a distinct lamination pattern with high levels in superficial layers and a band displaying lower levels in deep cortical layers. The results confirm previous studies on the distribution of 5-HT4 receptors in the human brain in vitro and provide high-resolution correlates for in vivo imaging studies using the radioligand recently developed for single photon emission tomography (SPET), [123I]SB 207710.
