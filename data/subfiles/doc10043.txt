	In the rat, activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptors causes hypothermia and the 5-HT syndrome. The effects of three chemically dissimilar 5-HT1A agonists administered s.c. [8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), gepirone, and (+)4[n-5-(methoxychroman-3-yl)n-propylamino]butyl-8-azas-piro[4,5]decane-7,adione ((+) S-20499)] on both of these responses were studied. The same maximal drop in body temperature (similar to 2.5 degrees C) was elicited by all three agonists, 8-OH-DPAT being the most potent (EC(50) = 0.05 mg/kg), followed by gepirone (1.8 mg/kg) and (+) S-20499 (8 mg/kg). Both pindolol, a nonselective 5-HT1A receptor/beta adrenoceptor antagonist and n-t-butyl,- 3-[1-[4-(2-methoxy)phenyl]piperazinyl]-1-phenylpropionamide [(+) WAY 100135], a more selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, dose dependently attenuated the hypothermia induced by all three agonists. From these data, we inferred that all three agonists caused hypothermia via activation of 5-HT1A receptors. The syndrome was observed reliably in rats at doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg 8-OH-DPAT; doses up to 100 mg/kg of gepirone or (+) S-20499 did not produce the syndrome. In reserpine-pretreated animals, 8-OH-DPAT (maximal effect at 2-4 mg/kg) and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT) (5 mg/kg) induced forepaw treading, whereas gepirone (10 mg/kg) and (+) S-20499 (75 mg/kg) did not. (+) WAY 100135 competitively antagonized the forepaw treading caused by 8-OH-DPAT in reserpine-pretreated rats. This indicates that forepaw treading, like hypothermia, is mediated by activation of 5-HT1A receptors. Gepirone (5-10 mg/kg) attenuated the forepaw treading induced by either 3-OH-DPAT (4 mg/kg) or 5-MeODMT (5 mg/kg); by contrast, (+) S-20499, at doses up to 75 mg/kg, did not attenuate the forepaw treading induced by either 8-OH-DPAT or 5-MeODMT. The inability of (+) S-20499 either to induce the 5-HT syndrome or forepaw treading or to attenuate the forepaw treading induced by other agonists could be due to several factors, one of which is that different subtypes of the 5HT(1A) receptor mediate hypothermia and the 5-HT syndrome.
