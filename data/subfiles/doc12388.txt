	The influence of ladasten and sydnocarb on dopamine and serotonin receptors and the biosynthesis and re-uptake of dopamine and serotonin has been studied. It is established that both drugs do not produce any direct effects on dopamine D1, D2, and D3 receptors in rat striatum as well as on serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors in rat frontal cortex in vitro. Ladasten in a single dose of 50 mg/kg (i.p.) stimulated ex vivo dopamine biosynthesis and release in striatum, without any influence on serotonin formation neither in striatum nor in frontal cortex. On the contrary, sydnocarb (17.5 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased the level of serotonin synthesis both in striatum and frontal cortex, while not affecting the biosynthesis of dopamine. Both ladasten and sydnocarb inhibited the active transport of dopamine in rat striatal synaptosomes at IC50 = 3.56 microM and 28.66 nM, respectively, but failed to influence the serotonin re-uptake in rat frontal cortex.
