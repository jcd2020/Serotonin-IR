Fiorino, F., et al. (2014). "5-HT(1A) receptor: an old target as a new attractive tool in drug discovery from central nervous system to cancer." J Med Chem 57(11): 4407-4426.

	The serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT(1A) was one of the first serotonin receptor subtypes pharmacologically characterized. This receptor subtype has long been object of intense research and is implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders. In recent years, new chemical entities targeting the 5-HT(1A) receptor (alone or in combination with other molecular targets) have been proposed for novel therapeutic uses in neuroprotection, cognitive impairment, Parkinson's disease, pain treatment, malignant carcinoid syndrome, and prostate cancer. This Perspective compares existing data on expression and signaling activity of the 5-HT(1A) receptor to a ligand with an intrinsic agonist or antagonist profile. Our purpose is also to make a complete overview, useful for underlining the features needed to select a specific pharmacological profile rather than another one. This aspect could be really interesting to consider and justify the 5-HT(1A) receptor as a new attractive target for drug discovery.
