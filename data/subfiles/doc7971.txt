Marcoli, M., et al. (2004). "5-HT control of ischemia-evoked glutamate efflux from human cerebrocortical slices." Neurochem Int 45(5): 687-691.

	The aim of the present investigation was to explore if glutamate efflux from human cerebrocortical slices caused by oxygen/glucose deprivation can be controlled by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). Slices were superfused in aerobic conditions or in conditions simulating moderate ischemic insult (24 min oxygen and glucose deprivation) and the efflux of previously accumulated [H-3]D-aspartate and of endogenous glutamate was measured in superfusate fractions. The efflux of both [H-3]D-aspartate and endogenous glutamate evoked by ischemia were reduced by at least 50% in the presence of 5-HT (1 muM). Moreover, the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (1 muM) "micked the 5-HT effect. We conclude that activation of 5-HT receptors of the 5-HT1A subtype inight help to control glutamate efflux and excitotoxic damage during ischemia in human cerebral cortex and would deserve to be considered in a multipharmacological approach to neuroprotection in brain ischemia.
