Lucas, G., et al. (2000). "The effect of serotonergic agents on haloperidol-induced striatal dopamine release in vivo: opposite role of 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor subtypes and significance of the haloperidol dose used." Neuropharmacology 39(6): 1053-1063.

	This study investigated, using microdialysis in freely-moving rats, the role of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT(2) receptor subtypes in the enhancement of striatal dopamine (DA) release induced by various doses of haloperidol. The subcutaneous injection of 0.01, 0.1 or 1 mg/kg haloperidol dose-dependently increased DA outflow (160, 219 and 230% of baseline, respectively). The effect of 0.01 mg/kg haloperidol was, respectively, potentiated by the 5-HT uptake inhibitor citalopram (1 mg/kg, s.c.; +35%) and reduced by the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.025 mg/kg, s.c.; -32%). Also, it was reduced by the 5-HT(2A) antagonist SR 46349B (0.5 mg/kg, s.c. ; -40%) or by the 5-HT(2A/2B/2C) antagonist ritanserin (1.25 mg/kg, i.p.; -34%), and potentiated by the 5-HT(2B/2C) antagonist SB 206553 (5 mg/kg, i.p; +78%). Further, only this latter compound significantly modified basal dopamine release by itself (+26%). Dopamine released by 0.1 mg/kg haloperidol was enhanced (+100%) by citalopram, decreased (-61%) by SR 4634B, but unaltered by SB 206553. Finally, none of the compounds used were able to modify the enhancement of dopamine release induced by 1 mg/kg haloperidol. These results show that central 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors exert an opposite (respectively excitatory and inhibitory) influence on DA release. Moreover, they suggest that the 5-HT(2A)-dependent modulation depends on the degree of central DA receptor blockade.
