Gerasimova Iu, A., et al. (2013). "[Behavioral effects during the local activation and blockade of serotonin and dopamine receptors in the frontal cortex in cats in the model with a choice of reinforcements of different value]." Zh Vyssh Nerv Deiat Im I P Pavlova 63(6): 699-710.

	In the model with a choice of reinforcements of different value animals were able to "impulsive" and "self-controlled" behavior with an equal probability. Five adult cats were tested. A local application of agonists of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/C) receptors (8-OH-DPAT, DOI) in the frontal cortex have resulted in a significant decrease of the "impulsive" reactions and an increase of omissions. The administration of antagonists of 5-HT(2A/C) receptors (ketanserin) and D1/D2 receptors (SCH 23390, raclopride) have impaired the "impulsive" behavior. However the combined administration of agonists/antagonists of 5-HT(2A/C) receptors and antagonists of D1/D2 receptors have not shown the significant changes in behavior as compared with control experiments. The data showed the realization of the optimal behavior with the "impulsive" and "self-controled" reactions in ambivalent animals requires the involvement of both dopaminergic and serotoninergic systems for the regulation of the activity of neurons in frontal cortex areas.
