Meyniel, J. P., et al. (1998). "Pharmacological profile of a putative fish lymphocyte 5-HT3 receptor." Biochemical Archives 14(2): 111-122.

	In this study, we examined the binding of H-3-BRL43694, an antagonist of the mammalian 5-HT3 receptor subtype, to fish peripheral blood lymphocytes. Scatchard plot provided a K-d and a B-max of 4.08+/-0.15 nM and 51.2+/-1.05 fmoles/10(6) cells, respectively. We further investigated the efficiency of a number of agonists/antagonists of the serotonergic receptors to displace H-3-BRL43694 binding to fish lymphocytes. Hence, the antagonists of the mammalian 5-HT3 receptor, e.g. ICS-205-930, metoclopramide, MDL-72222, quipazine, LY-278-584 and BRL43694, displaced the binding of H-3-BRL43694 to fish lymphocytes; whereas the agents specific to other serotonergic receptors, buspirone and 8-OH-DPAT (5-HT1A), CGS-12066A (5-HT1B), ketanserine and sulpiride (5-HT2), propranolol and methiothepine (5-HT1) failed to displace the binding process, demonstrating that H-3-BRL43694 labels a putative lymphocyte 5-HT3 receptor. The specific binding of H-3-BRL43694 to lymphocytes was consistent with one site model (n(H)=1+/-0.15). However, the pharmacological studies on the displacement of H-3-BRL43694 by non-radiolabelled BRL43694 revealed two binding sites. Interestingly, all the other ligands of the 5-HT3 receptor revealed only one recognition site and displayed low affinity for the fish lymphocyte 5-HT3 receptor. On the contrary, the Hill constants (n(H)) for these 5-HT3 receptor agents, e.g. metoclopramide, 2-methyl-5-HT and MDL-72222, being inferior to one, do not demonstrate the presence of only one 5-HT3 recognition site. These results all together suggest that the fish lymphocyte 5-HT3 receptor exhibits a particular pharmacological profile.
