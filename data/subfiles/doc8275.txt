	Loading therapy consisting of the ACNU regimen was instituted as postoperative anticancer chemotherapy for malignant gliomas. The efficacy rate of the regimen was 25% at a dose of 3 mg/kg. A high incidence of hematological changes, such as leukopenia (neutropenia) and thrombocytopenia, were observed after chemotherapy. The former could be prevented by the administration of G-CSF, but platelet infusions were necessary in some patients for amelioration of thrombocytopenia. Gastroenterological symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, were also frequently noted. Granisetron (Kytril), which is a recently developed selective competitive inhibitor of the 5-HT3 receptor, was used for the treatment of these adverse effects, and was found to be clinically effective.
