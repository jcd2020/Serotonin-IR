Llamosas, N., et al. (2017). "Inactivation of GIRK channels weakens the pre- and postsynaptic inhibitory activity in dorsal raphe neurons." Physiological Reports 5(3).

	The serotonergic tone of the dorsal raphe (DR) is regulated by 5-HT1A receptors, which negatively control serotonergic activity via the activation of G protein- coupled inwardly rectifying K + (GIRK) channels. In addition, DR activity is modulated by local GABAergic transmission, which is believed to play a key role in the development of mood-related disorders. Here, we sought to characterize the role of GIRK2 subunit-containing channels on the basal electrophysiological properties of DR neurons and to investigate whether the presynaptic and postsynaptic activities of 5-HT1A, GABAB, and GABAA receptors are affected by Girk2 gene deletion. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from GIRK2 knockout mice revealed that the GIRK2 subunit contributes to maintenance of the resting membrane potential and to the membrane input resistance of DR neurons. 5-HT1A and GABAB receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents were almost absent in the mutant mice. Spontaneous and evoked GABAA receptor-mediated transmissions were markedly reduced in GIRK2 KO mice, as the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs were reduced, the paired-pulse ratio was increased and GABA-induced whole-cell currents were decreased. Similarly, the pharmacological blockade of GIRK channels with tertiapin- Q prevented the 5-HT1A and GABAB receptor-mediated postsynaptic currents and increased the paired-pulse ratio. Finally, deletion of the Girk2 gene also limited the presynaptic inhibition of GABA release exerted by 5-HT1A and GABAB receptors. These results indicate that the properties and inhibitory activity of DR neurons are highly regulated by GIRK2 subunitcontaining channels, introducing GIRK channels as potential candidates for studying the pathophysiology and treatment of affective disorders.
