Heimbold, I., et al. (2002). "A novel technetium-99m radioligand for the 5-HT1A receptor derived from desmethyl-WAY-100635 (DWAY)." European Journal of Nuclear Medicine 29(1): 82-87.

	This paper reports the synthesis, biological evaluation and in vitro autoradiography of a new technetium-99m radioligand with high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor. The neutral complex combines an N2S2 diamine dithiol (DADT) ligand as complexing moiety for oxotechnetium(V) and a 2-(1-piperazino)phenol via a 6-carbon alkyl chain, derived from desmethyl-WAY 100635 (DWAY). The complex displays an IC50 value for the 5-HT1A receptor of 1.29 nM against the selective 5-HT1A agonist [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, a moderate selectivity towards the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (IC50 of 8.1 nM against [H-3]prazosin) and a good selectivity for the D-2 receptor (IC50 of 192 nM against [H-3]spiperone) and the 5-HT2A receptor (IC50 of 922 nM against [H-3]ketanserin). Biodistribution studies in rats show an initial brain uptake of 0.56%+/-0.07% ID 2.5 min p.i. In vitro autoradiographic studies of the Tc-99m complex in rat brains indicate a strong specific accumulation of the radioactivity in 5-HT1A receptor-rich brain regions.
