Hook, B. B., et al. (1991). "TRICYCLIC NONPHENOLIC DERIVATIVES OF 8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN - STEREOSELECTIVE INTERACTIONS WITH 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN THE BRAIN." European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 26(2): 215-220.

	The enantiomers of 3,4,7,8,9,10-hexahydro- and 7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-9-(di-n-propylamino)-2H-1-naphtho[1,2-b]pyran (4 and 3, respectively) have been synthesized and evaluated for central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and dopamine receptor activity by the use of behavioural and biochemical tests in rats. In addition, the ability of the compounds to displace [H-3]-8-OH DPAT from 5-HT(1A) receptors was evaluated; the affinity of (R)-3 (K(i) = 26 nM), (S)-3 (K(i) = 130 nM), (R)-4 (K(i) = 19 nM) and (S)-4 (K(i) = 130 nM) were lower than that of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (1) (K(i) = 1.0 nM). Similarly, the new compounds, which are structurally related to 1, were less potent than 1 as 5-HT(1A) receptor agonists.
