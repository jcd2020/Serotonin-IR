Frank, R. A., et al. (1995). "MIXED D-2/5-HT2A ANTAGONISM OF AMPHETAMINE-INDUCED FACILITATION OF BRAIN-STIMULATION REWARD." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 52(4): 799-804.

	Recent experiments have demonstrated that 5-HT2A antagonists can modify electrophysiological, neurochemical, and behavioral responses to psychostimulants. These findings led to an interest in using 5-HT2A antagonists to block the effects of psychostimulants on brain reward mechanisms. The present experiments assessed the ability of mixed D-2/5-HT2A antagonists to reverse amphetamine-induced facilitation of self-stimulation. The D-2/5-HT2A antagonists MDL 28,133A and risperidone attenuated the effects of cocaine and amphetamine, but only at antagonist doses that elevated baseline self-stimulation thresholds. A comparison of the effects of the mixed antagonists to those of haloperidol and eticlopride revealed that all four antagonists produced similar anti-stimulant effects when the influence of the drugs on baseline responding was considered. The D-2 activity of the antagonists appears to account for their ability to reduce the effects of psychostimulants on self-stimulation. 5-HT2A antagonism makes a negligible contribution to the anti-amphetamine effects.
