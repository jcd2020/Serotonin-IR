Pullar, I. A., et al. (2001). "In vitro activity of LY393558, an inhibitor of the 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter with 5-HT1B/1D/2 receptor antagonist properties." European Journal of Pharmacology 432(1): 9-17.

	1-[2-[4-(6-fluoro-1 H-indol-3-yl)-3,6-dihydro-1(2H)-pyridinyl]ethyl]-3-isopropyl-6-(methylsulphonyl)-3,4-dihydro-1 H-2,1,3-benzothiadiazine-2,2-dioxide (LY393558) is a potent inhibitor of [(3) H]5-hydroxytryptamine ([H-3]5-HT) uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes (pIC(50) = 8.48 +/- 0.12). It produces a dextral shift of the 5-HT dose-response curves for the binding of GTP gamma[S-35] to human 5-HT2A (pK(b) = 9.05 +/- 0.14) and 5-HT1D (pK(b) = 8.98 +/- 0.07) receptors and inhibits the contractile response of the rabbit saphenous vein to the 5-HT1B/D receptor agonist, sumatriptan (pK(b) = 8.4 +/- 0.2). In addition, it is an antagonist at the 5-HT2A (pK(i) = 7.29 +/- 0.19) and 5-HT2A (pK(i) = 7.35 +/- 0.11) receptors. Presynaptic autoreceptor antagonist activity was demonstrated by its ability to potentiate the K+-induced Outflow Of [3 H]5-HT from guinea pig cortical slices (pEC(50) = 7.74 +/- 0.05 nM) in which the 5-HT transporter had been inhibited by a maximally effective concentration of paroxetine. It is concluded that LY393558 should be an effective antidepressant with the potential to produce an earlier onset of efficacy than selective serotonin uptake inhibitors.
