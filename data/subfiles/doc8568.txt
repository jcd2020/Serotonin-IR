	The 5-HT1B receptors have been identified by radioligand binding techniques predominantly in the basal ganglia of the rat and mouse brain. A number of 5-HT receptor agonists have been shown to display high affinity but limited selectivity for the 5-HT1B recognition site. These include 5-CT, 5-HT, RU 24969, TFMPP, MCPP, and CGS 12066B. Antagonists at the 5-HT1B site include the drugs metitepin, metergoline, cyanopindolol, isamoltane, and propranolol but none of these drugs are selective for this receptor. Functional correlates of 5-HT1B receptor activation have been most closely defined in vitro. These include inhibition of transmitter release, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase and actions on the mouse urinary bladder strip and the rat vena cava. Many functional correlates of 5-HT1B receptor activation in vivo have been proposed, but convincing evidence from antagonist studies is generally lacking. The development of selective 5-HT1B receptor agonists and antagonists will be a key step in defining the physiological role of this receptor site in the brain and periphery of the mouse and rat although it must be realized that these compounds, if they are developed, are unlikely to have functional effects in man since the 5-HT1B recognition site is absent in the human CNS. Nevertheless many of these studies on the 5-HT1B receptor may aid the development of drugs acting at the 5-HT1D site since this receptor has been identified as being the equivalent of the 5-HT1B site in species other than the rat and mouse.
