Bernotas, R. C., et al. (2009). "Novel 1-aminoethyl-3-arylsulfonyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines are potent 5-HT(6) agonists." Bioorg Med Chem 17(14): 5153-5163.

	A series of 1-aminoethyl-3-arylsulfonyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridines 10a-z was prepared as novel 5-HT(6) ligands. The best compounds were high affinity, full agonists at 5-HT(6) receptors. Several agonists demonstrated good selectivity over other serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. Acute administration of selective agonist 10e significantly increased extracellular GABA concentrations in rat frontal cortex. This compound also reduced adjunctive drinking behavior in the rat schedule-induced polydipsia assay, possibly predictive of efficacy in obsessive compulsive disorder and other anxiety related disorders.
