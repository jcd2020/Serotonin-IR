	If serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamin [5-HT]) is well known for its role in mood regulation, it also impacts numerous physiological functions at periphery. Serotonin is synthetized at the periphery into the gut by intestinal enterochromaffin cells and in the central nervous system (CNS) in the raphe nucleus from the essential amino acid tryptophan. Physiological effects of 5-HT are mediated by about 15 serotoninergic receptors grouped into seven broad families (5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 receptor families). Except 5-HT3 receptor, a ligand-gated ion channels, all the others are G protein-coupled receptors. Serotonin's homeostasis involves serotoninergic autoreceptor such as 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, the enzymatic degradation of serotonin by monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), and a transporter (serotoninergic transporter [SERT]). In the CNS, the SERT is a key target for various antidepressant drugs such as Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI), Serotonin Norepinephrin Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRI) and tricyclics family. However, antidepressant activity of SERT inhibitors is not directly mediated by the SERT inhibition, but a consequence of postsynaptic 5-HT receptor activation following the increase in 5-HT levels in the synaptic cleft. In pharmacology, SSRIs are defined as indirect agonist of postsynaptic receptor. Among all the 5-HT receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2B and 5-HT4 receptors activation would mediate antidepressant effects. In the meanwhile, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors activation would induce opposite effects. The best serotoninergic antidepressant would directly activate 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B. 5-HT2B and 5-HT4 and would block 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptor. If the chemical synthesis of such a compound may be compromised, SERT inhibition associated with the blockade of some but not all 5-HT receptor could shorten onset of action and/or improve antidepressant efficacy on the overall symptomatology of depression.
