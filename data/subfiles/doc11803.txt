	UNLABELLED: Aripiprazole's pharmacologic properties (including dopamine 2 and 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A [5HT1A] receptor partial agonism and 5HT2A receptors antagonism) may be associated with the onset of hiccups. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 21-year-old, antipsychotic-naive patient with bipolar I disorder and remote brain trauma developed persistent hiccups following aripiprazole titration. Despite trials of metoclopramide and chlorpromazine, hiccups continued. Remission of hiccups occurred with discontinuation of aripiprazole. DISCUSSION: The exact etiology of hiccups is unknown but likely involves dopamine and/or gamma-butyric acid. Highlighting the uncertainty related to drug-induced hiccups is the fact that multiple antipsychotics have been reported to not only induce hiccups but also to alleviate them. As the development of persistent hiccups may result in extensive medical workup, clinicians should be aware of drug-associated causes including aripiprazole.
