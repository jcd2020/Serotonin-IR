Mendez, S. B. and A. Salazar-Juarez (2019). "Mirtazapine attenuates anxiety- and depression-like behaviors in rats during cocaine withdrawal." Journal of Psychopharmacology 33(5): 589-605.

	Background: Anxiety and depression, key symptoms of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome in human addicts, are considered the main factors that precipitate relapse in chronic cocaine addiction. Preclinical studies have found that rodents exposed to different withdrawal periods show an increase in anxiety and depressive-like behavior. Mirtazapine - a tetracyclic medication - is used primarily to treat depression and, sometimes, anxiety. It has also successfully improved withdrawal symptoms in drug-dependent patients. Aim: This study sought to determine whether chronic dosing of mirtazapine during cocaine withdrawal reduced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors that characterize cocaine withdrawal in animals. Methods: Cocaine pre-treated Wistar rats were subjected to a 60-day cocaine withdrawal period during which depression- and anxiety-like behaviors were evaluated in open field tests (OFT), the elevated plus-maze (EPM), the light-dark box test (LDT), the forced swimming test (FST) and spontaneous locomotor activity (SLA). Results: We found that chronic dosing with different doses of mirtazapine (30 and 60 mg/kg) decreased depression- and anxiety-like behaviors induced by different doses of cocaine (10, 20 and 40 mg/kg) during the 60-day cocaine withdrawal. Interpretation: Our results suggest that the pharmacological effect of mirtazapine on its target sites of action ((2)-adrenergic and 5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors) within the brain may improve depression- and anxiety-like behaviors for long periods. Conclusion: Therefore, the findings support the use of mirtazapine as a potentially effective therapy to reduce anxiety and depressive-like behavior during cocaine withdrawal.
