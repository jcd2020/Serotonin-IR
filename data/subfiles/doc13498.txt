Wierucka-Rybak, M., et al. (2016). "THE INHIBITORY EFFECT OF COMBINATION TREATMENT WITH LEPTIN AND CANNABINOID CB1 RECEPTOR AGONIST ON FOOD INTAKE AND BODY WEIGHT GAIN IS MEDIATED BY SEROTONIN 1B AND 2C RECEPTORS." Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 67(3): 457-463.

	Previous studies reported that the co-injection of leptin and cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonists reduces food intake and body weight in rats, and this effect is more profound than that induced by these compounds individually. Additionally, serotonin mediates the effects of numerous anorectic drugs. To investigate whether serotonin interacts with leptin and endocannabinoids to affect food intake and body weight, we administered 5-hydroxytryptamine(HT)(1B) and 5-hydroxytryptamine(HT)(2C) serotonin receptor antagonists (3 mg/kg GR 127935 and 0.5 mg/kg SB 242084, respectively) to male Wistar rats treated simultaneously with leptin (100 mu g/kg) and the CBI receptor inverse agonist AM 251 (1 mg/kg) for 3 days. In accordance with previous findings, the co-injection of leptin and AM 251, but not the individual injection of each drug, resulted in a significant decrease in food intake and body weight gain. Blockade of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors completely abolished the leptin-and AM 251-induced anorectic and body-weight-reducing effects. These results suggest that serotonin mediates the leptin- and AM 251-dependent regulation of feeding behavior in rats via the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors.
