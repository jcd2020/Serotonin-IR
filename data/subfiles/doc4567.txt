	The most recently discovered serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtype, 5-HT7, is considered to be associated with several CNS disorders. Noninvasive in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) studies of cerebral 5-HT7 receptors could provide a significant advance in the understanding of the neurobiology and eventual dysfunctions of the 5-HT7 receptor. To date, no appropriate 5-HT7 receptor PET ligand has been developed. Here, we modified known 5-HT7 selective phenylpiperazinyl-butyloxindole derivatives so that they may be labeled either with carbon-11 or fluorine-18. A set of potential 5-HT7 ligands for PET molecular imaging was successfully synthesized. Two compounds (10 and 14) were tested against a range of targets. Both compounds display a promising in vitro profile with respect to PET imaging of the 5-HT7 receptor thalamic regions.
