Go≈Çembiowska, K. and A. Zylewska (1999). "Effect of antidepressant drugs on veratridine-evoked glutamate and aspartate release in rat prefrontal cortex." Pol J Pharmacol 51(1): 63-70.

	In vivo microdialysis in conscious rats was used to evaluate the effect of local application, through a microdialysis probe, of desipramine (DMI), imipramine and citalopram (CIT), on veratridine-evoked glutamate and aspartate release in rat prefrontal cortex (PFCx). All antidepressant drugs (ADs), given at a concentration of 0.1 mM, significantly inhibited glutamate release, while aspartate release was affected only by DMI and CIT. In contrast, local administration of ADs markedly potentiated veratridine-evoked dopamine and noradrenaline release. Perfusion of clonidine, quinpirole and 1-[3-(trifluoro-methyl)phenyl]-piperazine (TFMPP) at 0.1 mM concentration also diminished, evoked release of glutamate and aspartate. The regulation of amino acid release in rat PFCx may be achieved by direct effect of ADs on Na+ channels or indirectly, by involvement of D2/D3, alpha 2 or 5-HT1B heteroceptors activated by the increased level of monoamines in response to the blockade of respective transporters.
