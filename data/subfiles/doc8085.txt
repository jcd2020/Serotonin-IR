Newman, M. E., et al. (1991). "Chloroamphetamine did not prevent the effects of chronic antidepressants on 5-hydroxytryptamine inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat hippocampus." Eur J Pharmacol 207(3): 209-213.

	Administration of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, 10 mg/kg i.p. on two occasions) to rats resulted in a severe depletion of [3H]paroxetine binding sites, a measure of presynaptic serotonergic terminals, in both cortex and hippocampus, but did not affect [3H]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin [( 3H]8-OH-DPAT) binding or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in hippocampal membranes. Administration of either imipramine (15 mg/kg i.p. for 2 weeks) or lithium (0.2% for 2 weeks) to PCA-treated rats did not affect [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding but reduced the degree of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase by 5-HT in hippocampal membranes. It is concluded that the effects of imipramine and Li+ on 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses in the hippocampus are exerted postsynaptically, possibly at a level distal to the receptor.
