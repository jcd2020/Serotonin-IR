Odagaki, Y., et al. (2019). "Dopamine-induced functional activation of G alpha(q) mediated by dopamine D-1-like receptor in rat cerebral cortical membranes." Journal of Receptors and Signal Transduction 39(1): 9-17.

	Although multiple roles of dopamine through D-1-like (D-1 and D-5) and D-2-like (D-2, D-3, and D-4) receptors are initiated primarily through stimulation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via G(s/olf) or G(i/o), respectively, there have been many reports indicating diverse signaling mechanisms that involve alternative G protein coupling. In this study, dopamine-induced G alpha(q) activation in rat brain membranes was investigated. Agonist-induced G alpha(q) activation was assessed by increase in guanosine-5 '-O-(3-[S-35]thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTP gamma S) binding to G alpha(q) determined by [S-35]GTP gamma S binding/immunoprecipitation assay in rat brain membranes. Dopamine-stimulated G alpha(q) functionality was highest in cortex as compared to hippocampus or striatum. In cerebral cortical membranes, this effect was mimicked by benzazepine derivatives with agonist properties at dopamine D-1-like receptors, that is, SKF83959, SKF83822, R(+)-SKF81297, R(+)-SKF38393, and SKF82958, but not by the compounds with dopamine D-2-like receptor agonist properties except for aripiprazole. Against expectation, stimulatory effects were also induced by SKF83566, R(+)-SCH23390, and pergolide. The pharmacological profiling by using a series of antagonists indicated that dopamine-induced response was mediated through dopamine D-1-like receptor, which was distinct from the receptor involved in 5-HT-induced response (5-HT2A receptor). Conversely, the responses induced by SKF83566, R(+)-SCH23390, and pergolide were most likely mediated by 5-HT2A receptor, but not by dopamine D-1-like receptor. Caution should be paid when interpreting the experimental data, especially in behavioral pharmacological research, in which SKF83566 or R(+)-SCH23390 is used as a standard selective dopamine D-1-like receptor antagonist. Also, possible clinical implications of the agonistic effects of pergolide on 5-HT2A receptor has been mentioned.
