Seguin, L., et al. (1997). "The endogenous cerebral tetrapeptide 5-HT-moduline reduces in vivo the functional activity of central 5-HT1B receptors in the rat." Neurosci Res 27(3): 277-280.

	5-HT-moduline (Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu, LSAL) is a novel endogenous peptide isolated from rat brain which interacts in vitro specifically with 5-HT(1B) receptors by a non-competitive mechanism. In the present study, we demonstrate that the efficacy of the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist CP 93 129 in inhibiting the forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the rat substantia nigra was reduced 15 min after intracerebral injection of LSAL compared to vehicle or ALLS (scrambled peptide) injected rats. Accordingly, the concentration-response curve of the agonist is shifted to the right with a 3.5-fold increase of the half-maximal inhibitory concentration compared to vehicle injected rats. Thus, the in vivo desensitization of serotonergic autoreceptors strongly strengthens the important role of 5-HT-moduline in the rapid adaptative control of the serotonergic system, implicated in numerous pathological events as anxiety and depression.
