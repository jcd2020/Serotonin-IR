	The effect of agmatine in preclinical behavioral tests of schizophrenia has been examined in rodents. Agmatine at the doses of 40 and 80 mg/kg blocked conditioned avoidance responding, attenuated apomorphine induced climbing, diminished amphetamine and ketamine hyperlocomotor activity and augmented plasma prolactin levels. Pretreatment of animals with 20 mg/kg of agmatine potentiated the inhibitory effect of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg. ip) and olanzepine (0.5 mg/kg, ip) in conditioned avoidance response test and apomorphine induced climbing. Agmatine alone at the doses tested here did not induce any cataleptic behavior in mice. However significant catalepsy was exhibited when agmatine (80 mg/kg, ip) was injected to mice pretreated with 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100, 635. These results indicate that agmatine via regulation of brain dopaminergic signaling modulates dopamine mediated behaviors. The alteration in the levels of endogenous agmatine may contribute to the genesis of psychosis and development of drugs that enhance endogenous agmatine content may be better therapeutic approach to treat schizophrenia with low incidences of extra pyramidal side effects.
