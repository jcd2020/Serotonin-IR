Chen, A., et al. (2003). "Serotonin type II receptor activation facilitates synaptic plasticity via N-methyl-D-aspartate-mediated mechanism in the rat basolateral amygdala." Neuroscience 119(1): 53-63.

	The modulation of synaptic plasticity by serotonin type II (5-hydroxytryptamine type II (5-HT2))-receptor stimulation was explored using intracellular, field potential and Fura-2 fluorescence image recordings in a rat amygdala slice preparation. Bath application of 5HT(2) receptor agonist 1-(2,5)-dimethoxy-4-lodophen-2-aminopropane (DOI) transformed theta-burst-stimulated (TBS) synaptic plasticity from short-term potentiation to long-term potentiation. DOI enhanced N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated potentials and calcium influx without affecting the resting membrane potential or input resistance of the neurons. In contrast, alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA)/kainate receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic responses were unaffected by DOI. The facilitating effects of DOI were blocked by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin, and by the 5-HT2C-receptor selective antagonist, RS102221. These results indicate that 5-HT2-receptor activation enhances NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic function in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). (C) Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of IBRO.
