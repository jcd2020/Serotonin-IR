CloÃ«z-Tayarani, I., et al. (1996). "Cellular localization of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA in the rat olfactory tubercle: do GABAergic neurons express the 5-HT1B gene?" Brain Res Mol Brain Res 36(2): 337-342.

	In situ hybridization with a 5-HT1B receptor probe and immunocytochemistry with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antibody performed on adjacent sections of rat brains reveal that GABAergic cell bodies, which represent 10-15% of the cellular population, do not express the 5-HT1B gene in rat olfactory tubercle. Most of the cells expressing the 5-HT1B gene were of small to medium size; large neurons expressing RNA transcripts may correspond to cholinergic neurons. It cannot be excluded that the absence of detectable 5-HT1B mRNA in GABAergic neurons was due to limited sensitivity of the in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry procedures. Our data suggest that GABAergic neurons originating from olfactory tubercle are not directly controlled by serotonin through 5-HT1B receptors.
