Chaouloff, F., et al. (1998). "GR 127935 and (+)-WAY 100135 do not affect TFMPP-induced inhibition of 5-HT synthesis in the midbrain and hippocampus of Wistar-Kyoto rats." Neuropharmacology 37(9): 1159-1167.

	Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats display high emotivity (e.g. anxiety), compared to Wistar rats. The key role of serotonin (5-HT)1B/1D autoreceptors in 5-HT neurotransmission, and its consequences on emotivity, led us to measure the effects of the nonselective 5-HT1B/1D) receptor agonist m-trifluoromethyl-phenylpiperazine (TFMPP) on central tryptophan hydroxylase activity in male WKY and Wistar rats. In addition to strain-dependent differences in central 5-HT synthesis (WKY > Wistar), acute administration of TFMPP (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) decreased the amplitude of m-hydroxy-benzylhydrazine-elicited accumulation of hippocampal, striatal and cortical 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in both strains. In midbrain, however, TFMPP decreased 5-HTP accumulation (but not tryptophan levels) in WKY rats only, whereas the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 0.2 mg/kg) decreased midbrain 5-HTP levels to a similar extent in both strains. Pretreatment of WKY rats with the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist N-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1, 2,4-oxadiozol-3-yl)-biphenyl-4-carboxamide (GR 127935, 1.5 and 3 mg/kg) slightly increased midbrain tryptophan hydroxylase activity but did not affect the negative effect of TFMPP on 5-HTP formation. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (+)-N-tert-butyl-3-(4-[2-methoxyphenyl]piperazin-1-yl)-2-phenylpro panamide ((+)-WAY 100135; 3 mg/kg), which decreased the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT on midbrain 5-HTP levels by 50%, did not alter that of TFMPP. Lastly, neither reserpine (5 mg/kg), ketanserin (1 mg/kg) mianserin (2 mg/kg) nor idazoxan (1 mg/kg) pretreatments affected TFMPP-induced inhibition of midbrain 5-HTP formation, ruling out a role for monoamine release, 5-HT2 receptors and alpha2-adrenoceptors. Our data show that TFMPP, an agonist often used to stimulate 5-HT1B/1D receptors, may inhibit central 5-HT synthesis through nonserotonergic mechanisms.
