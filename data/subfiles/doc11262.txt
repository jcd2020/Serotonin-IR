Sanger, G. J. and D. R. Nelson (1989). "Selective and functional 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonism by BRL 43694 (granisetron)." Eur J Pharmacol 159(2): 113-124.

	The activity of BRL 43694 (granisetron) was investigated using established models of 5-HT3 receptor activity. In guinea-pig isolated ileum, BRL 43694 antagonised the contractions evoked by relatively high concentrations of 5-HT (pA2 = 8.1 +/- 0.2). However, except in high concentrations, BRL 43694 did not affect the contractions of similar preparations of ileum, evoked by electrical field stimulation (cholinergically mediated), the nicotinic agonist dimethylphenyl piperazinium (DMPP) or by cholecystokinin octapeptide. Similarly, BRL 43694 did not affect electrically evoked, cholinergically mediated contractions of rat or human isolated stomach. In other models of 5-HT3 receptor activity (rabbit isolated heart, Bezold-Jarisch reflex in anaesthetised rats), potent antagonism by BRL 43694 was demonstrated. In radioligand binding studies on rat brain membranes, BRL 43694 had little or no affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2 or for many other binding sites. BRL 43694 may therefore be a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.
