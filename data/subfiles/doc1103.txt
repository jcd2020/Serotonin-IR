	RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVE: Agonists of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of cognitive deficits. This study describes the in vitro pharmacology of the novel α7 nAChR agonist/serotonin 5-HT3 receptor (5-HT3R) antagonist N-[(3R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl]-6-chinolincarboxamide (EVP-5141) and its behavioral effects. RESULTS: EVP-5141 bound to α7 nAChRs in rat brain membranes (K i  = 270 nM) and to recombinant human serotonin 5-HT3Rs (K i  = 880 nM) but had low affinity for α4β2 nAChRs (K i  > 100 μM). EVP-5141 was a potent agonist at recombinant rat and human α7 nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes. EVP-5141 acted as 5-HT3R antagonist but did not block α3β4, α4β2, and muscle nAChRs. Rats trained to discriminate nicotine from vehicle did not generalize to EVP-5141 (0.3-30 mg kg(-1), p.o.), suggesting that the nicotine cue is not mediated by the α7 nAChR and that EVP-5141 may not share the abuse liability of nicotine. EVP-5141 (0.3-3 mg kg(-1)) improved performance in the rat social recognition test. EVP-5141 (0.3 mg kg(-1), p.o.) ameliorated scopolamine-induced retention deficits in the passive avoidance task in rats. EVP-5141 (1 mg kg(-1), i.p.) improved spatial working memory of aged (26- to 32-month-old) rats in a water maze repeated acquisition task. In addition, EVP-5141 improved both object and social recognition memory in mice (0.3 mg kg(-1), p.o.). CONCLUSIONS: EVP-5141 improved performance in several learning and memory tests in both rats and mice, supporting the hypothesis that α7 nAChR agonists may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia.
