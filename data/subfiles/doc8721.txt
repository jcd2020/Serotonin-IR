	The neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT serotonin) plays an important role in a wide range of non-neural processes. Using immunofluorescence with an antiserotonin antibody, 5-HT was localized in the brain and in some neurons of the larval tail of Phallusia mammillata. To test the effect of 5-HT on development, we treated embryos with two different 5-HT receptor subtype antagonists. Treatment at the gastrula stage with 10 muM ondansetron, an antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptor, induced anterior truncation and a short tail. At 10 muM, ritanserin, a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist, induced larval phenotypes characterized by a roundish trunk region with flat papillae. The juveniles developed from these larvae had an abnormal cardiocirculatory systems their heart contractions were ineffective and their blood cells accumulated in the heart cavity. We conclude that an appropriate level of 5-HT is necessary for correct development and morphogenesis. Moreover, a different key role for multiple receptors in modulating the morphogenetic effects of 5-HT is suggested.
