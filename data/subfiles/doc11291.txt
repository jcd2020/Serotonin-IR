Uphouse, L., et al. (1994). "Agonist activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the median raphe nucleus and female rat lordosis behavior." Brain Res 668(1-2): 271-275.

	Proestrous rats were infused unilaterally into the median raphe nucleus with 200-2,000 ng of the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). Inhibition of the lordosis to mount ratio occurred within 15 and 10 min, respectively, following infusion with 1,000 or 2,000 ng of the drug. Infusion of 2,000 ng of the 5-HT2 agonist, (+/-)-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI), or 4,000 ng 5-HT (creatinine sulfate) failed to substantially reduce lordosis behavior.
