	Various types of atypical antipsychotic drugs (AAPDs) modestly improve the cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). RP5063 is an AAPD with a diverse and unique pharmacology, including partial agonism at dopamine (DA) D2, D3, D4, serotonin (5-HT)1A, and 5-HT2A receptors (Rs), full agonism at alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh)R (nAChR), and antagonism at 5-HT2B, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7Rs. Most atypical APDs are 5-HT2A inverse agonists. The efficacy of RP5063 in mouse models of psychosis and episodic memory were studied. RP5063 blocked acute phencyclidine (PCP)-as well as amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, indicating antipsychotic activity. Acute administration of RP5063 significantly reversed subchronic (sc)PCP-induced impairment in novel object recognition (NOR), a measure of episodic memory, but not reversal learning, a measure of executive function. Co-administration of a sub-effective dose (SED) of RP5063 with SEDs of a 5-HT7R antagonist, a 5-HT1BR antagonist, a 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, or an alpha4beta2 nAChR agonist, restored the ability of RP5063 to ameliorate the NOR deficit in scPCP mice. Pre-treatment with a 5-HT1AR, a D4R, antagonist, but not an alpha4beta2 nAChR antagonist, blocked the ameliorating effect of RP5063. Further, co-administration of scRP5063 prior to each dose of PCP prevented the effect of PCP to produce a deficit in NOR for one week. RP5063, given to scPCP-treated mice for one week restored NOR for one week only. Acute administration of RP5063 significantly increased cortical DA efflux, which may be critical to some of its cognitive enhancing properties. These results indicate that RP5063, by itself, or as an adjunctive treatment has a multifaceted basis for improving some cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.
