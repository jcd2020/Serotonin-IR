	Local administration of serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists inhibits panic-like reactions induced by electrical stimulation of the rat dorsolateral periaqueductal grey (dlPAG). This anti-aversive effect is enhanced by chronic treatment with anti-panic drugs such as clomipramine. Since nitric oxide (NO) may mediate panic-like behavior in the dlPAG, we tested the hypothesis that chronic clomipramine treatment would also potentiate the effects of locally injected 5-HT-receptor agonists on panic-like reactions induced by intra-dlPAG injection of an NO-donor (SIN). After 21 days of daily i.p. injections of saline or clomipramine (10 mg/kg) male Wistar rats received local injections of saline, the 5-HT(1A)-receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (8 nmol) or the 5-HT2A/2C-receptor agonist DOI (16 nmol) followed by saline or SIN (150 nmol). NO-induced panic-like reactions were inhibited by DOI, but not by 8-OH-DPAT. Chronic clomipramine did not modify these effects but tended to produce anti-aversive effect by itself. In chronically clomipramine treated animals 8-OH-DPAT potentiated NO-induced panic-like reactions. The results indicate that the panic-like effects of NO in the dlPAG may be attenuated by 5-HT2A/2C-, but not by 5-HT1A-receptors. The anti-aversive effect of DOI is not modified by chronic clomipramine treatment.
