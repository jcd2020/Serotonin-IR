Lum, J. T. and M. F. Piercey (1988). "Electrophysiological evidence that spiperone is an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus." Eur J Pharmacol 149(1-2): 9-15.

	The neuroleptic spiperone, which binds to 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and dopamine (DA) receptors, was studied for its effects on serotonin (5-HT) and DA neurons in dorsal raphe nucleus and substantia nigra pars compacta, respectively. We found that 1 mg/kg i.v. spiperone, but not LY53837 (a 5-HT2 antagonist), antagonized the inhibition induced by 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and buspirone in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Lower spiperone doses blocked DA receptors in substantia nigra pars compacta, but did not affect 5-HT neurons. Doses of 8-OH-DPAT completely silencing dorsal raphe neurons were ineffective in substantia nigra pars compacta. However, buspirone antagonized DA receptors in substantia nigra pars compacta with doses similar to those depressing dorsal raphe neurons. It is concluded that spiperone is an antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus.
