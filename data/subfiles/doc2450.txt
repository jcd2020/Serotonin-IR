	PD 158771 has been described in receptor binding and biochemical tests as a partial agonist at dopamine (DA) D2 and D3 receptors as well as an agonist at serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptors. The present studies describe the profile of PD 158771 in rodent and primate behavioral tests. PD 158771 reduced spontaneous locomotor activity in mice (ED50=0.38 mg/kg, i.p.) and rats (ED50=1.2 mg/kg, i.p. and 0.16 mg/kg, s.c.), and reduced amphetamine-stimulated locomotion in mice (ED50=0.13 mg/kg, i.p.). At relatively higher doses up to 3 mg/kg, s.c. in rats, PD 158771 did not produce locomotor stimulation or induce stereotypy, indicating a lack of postsynaptic DA agonist activity. PD 158771 reduced apomorphine stimulated locomotion in rats at a dose 4.6-fold greater than those that reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, indicating weak postsynaptic DA antagonist actions; results consistent with a partial agonist profile. PD 158771 produced anxiolytic-like effects in the water-lick (Vogel) conflict test, effects possibly due to the 5-HT1A activity. However, PD 158771 was inactive in the water wheel behavioral despair model in rats, indicating lack of antidepressant properties. Similar to known antipsychotics, PD 158771 produced a potent and long-lasting inhibition of conditioned avoidance responding in squirrel monkeys. In contrast to standard antipsychotics, and similar to clozapine, PD 158771 did not cause catalepsy in rats at a dose 20-fold higher than the ED50 dose for locomotor inhibition. PD 158771 also had a somewhat lower liability than haloperidol to produce extrapyramidal dysfunction in squirrel and cebus monkeys sensitized to the dystonic effects of haloperidol. The data indicate that PD 158771 is a DA partial agonist with weak intrinsic activity that selectively activates brain DA autoreceptors. PD 158771 produced behavioral effects consistent with potential antipsychotic and anxiolytic efficacy, and has an improved profile in the extrapyramidal side effect model when compared to certain currently available antipsychotic agents.
