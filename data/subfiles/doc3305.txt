Fisher, P. M., et al. (2006). "Capacity for 5-HT1A-mediated autoregulation predicts amygdala reactivity." Nat Neurosci 9(11): 1362-1363.

	We examined the contribution of 5-HT1A autoreceptors (with [11C]WAY100635 positron emission tomography) to amygdala reactivity (with blood oxygenation level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging) in 20 healthy adult volunteers. We found a significant inverse relationship wherein 5-HT1A autoreceptor density predicted a notable 30-44% of the variability in amygdala reactivity. Our data suggest a potential molecular mechanism by which a reduced capacity for negative feedback regulation of 5-HT release is associated with increased amygdala reactivity.
