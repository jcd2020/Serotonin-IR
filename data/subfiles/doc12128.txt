Steffens, S. M., et al. (2010). "WAY100635 blocks the hypophagia induced by 8-OH-DPAT in the hypothalamic nuclei." Physiol Behav 99(5): 632-637.

	This study examined the influence of pretreatment with N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide maleate (WAY100635, full 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, 37 nmol) on feeding effects evoked by local injections of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(7) receptor agonist, 6 nmol) into the LH and into the ARC of female rats adapted to a wet mash diet (enriched with 10% sucrose), during diestrus or estrus. The results showed that the LH-pretreatment with WAY100635 suppressed the hypophagic effects evoked by 8-OH-DPAT during estrus as well as diestrus. The ARC pretreatment with WAY100635 blockaded the hypophagia evoked by 8-OH-DPAT in estrus rats. The previous treatment with WAY100635 in the ARC also suppressed the feeding duration decrease evoked by 8-OH-DPAT in estrus. The latency to start feeding, the drinking behavior and the durations of other non-ingestive behaviors were not affected by the different treatments, hypothalamic regions (LH or ARC), and/or estrous cycle stages (diestrus and estrus), except for the locomotion duration increase after 8-OH-DAPT in LH-pretreated rats in diestrus. The present findings confirm our previous suggestion that ARC- and the LH-5-HT(1A) receptors participate in the serotonergic control of feeding and that these feeding-related serotonergic circuits in LH are affected by ovarian hormones, since the treatment with WAY100635 evoked a hypophagia response during the diestrus phases.
