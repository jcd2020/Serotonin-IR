Mokrosz, M. J., et al. (1997). "5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor affinity and functional profile of some N-[3-(4-aryl-1-piperazinyl)propyl] derivatives of indolin-2(1H)-one, quinolin-2(1 H)-one and isoquinolin-1(2H)-one. Part 30: Structure-activity relationship studies of CNS agents." Pharmazie 52(6): 423-428.

	A series of new 1-aryl-4-propylpiperazines containing the modified terminal amide fragment 9, 15-19, 21, 23 and 25 were synthesized and their 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor affinities were determined. All the compound were highly potent 5-HT1A receptor ligands with a diverse 5-HT2A receptor affinity. It was found that the 5-HT2A receptor affinity depends on the dipole moment and lipophilicity of amide moiety. Compound 9b was found to be a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and a weak 5-HT1A receptor agonist.
