	Hesperidin, a well-known flavanone glycoside mostly found in citrus fruits, showed neuroprotective and antidepressant activity. Agomelatine, a melatonergic MT1/MT2 agonist and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, exhibits good antidepressant efficacy. Bupropion has been widely used for the treatment of depression because of its dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. The objective of present study was to assess the antidepressant effects of hesperidin combination with agomelatine or bupropion. Male Swiss Albino mice received treatment of saline, vehicle, 'hesperidin alone', 'agomelatine alone', hesperidin+agomelatine, 'bupropion alone', hesperidin+bupropion, and agomelatine+bupropion for 14 days. The immobility period was analysed 30 min after the treatment in forced swim and tail suspension tests. Dopamine and serotonin levels were analysed in hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and whole brain using HPLC with fluorescence detector. Hesperidin plus agomelatine treated group was better in terms of decrease in immobility period and increase in dopamine and serotonin levels when compared to their respective monotherapy treated groups.
