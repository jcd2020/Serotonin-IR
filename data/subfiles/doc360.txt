Antonelli, T., et al. (2005). "Effects of sarizotan on the corticostriatal glutamate pathways." Synapse 58(3): 193-199.

	The effects of sarizotan, a 5-HT(1A) agonist with additional affinity for D(3) and D(4) receptors, have been studied on the corticostriatal glutamate pathways using dual-probe microdialysis in the awake rat. Sarizotan given systemically (0.1-10 mg/kg s.c.) or perfused into the motor cortex (10 microM) produced 20-30% reduction of cortical and striatal glutamate levels. The inhibitory effects of the systemic sarizotan on cortical and striatal glutamate levels were counteracted by intracortical perfusion with the 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY100135 (10 microM). These findings suggest that the anti-dyskinetic properties of sarizotan could be mediated via its 5-HT(1A) agonist actions in the motor cortex, leading to reduced activity in the corticostriatal glutamate pathways with reduced activation of the striatopallidal GABA pathway mediating motor inhibition.
