	To examine the direct effects of serotonin (5-HT) on the release and synthesis of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), 5-HT was microinjected just onto the bilateral PVN of conscious rats. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels peaked at 30 min and returned to the basal levels in 90 min. Northern blot analysis revealed that the CRF messenger RNA (mRNA) level in the PVN as well as the proopiomelanocortin mRNA level in the anterior pituitary significantly increased 120 min after the 5-HT injections (50-250 nmol/side). Pretreatment with intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of pindobind 5-HT1A (5 nmol) or LY-278584 (500 nmol) completely abolished the 5-HT-induced ACTH response, whereas LY-53857 (100 nmol) was without effect. These results suggest that 5-HT stimulates CRF release, which has interactions with 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 receptors on CRF neurons in the PVN, and activates CRF synthesis in conscious rats.
