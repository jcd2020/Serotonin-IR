Hines, C. S., et al. (2011). "Human biodistribution and dosimetry of (1)(1)C-CUMI-101, an agonist radioligand for serotonin-1a receptors in brain." PLoS One 6(9): e25309.

	UNLABELLED: As a reported agonist, (1)(1)C-CUMI-101 is believed to selectively bind the G-protein-coupled state of the serotonin-1A (5-HT(1A)) receptor, thereby providing a measure of the active subset of all 5-HT(1A) receptors in brain. Although (1)(1)C-CUMI-101 has been successfully used to quantify 5-HT(1A) receptors in human and monkey brain, its radiation exposure has not previously been reported. The purpose of this study was to calculate the radiation exposure to organs of the body based on serial whole-body imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) in human subjects. METHODS: Nine healthy volunteers were injected with 428+/-84 MBq (mean +/- SD) (11)C-CUMI-101 and then imaged with a PET-only device for two hours from head to mid-thigh. Eleven source organs (brain, heart, liver, pancreas, stomach, spleen, lungs, kidneys, lumbar spine L1-5, thyroid, and urinary bladder) were identified on whole body images and used to calculate radiation doses using the software program OLINDA/EXM 1.1. To confirm that we had correctly identified the pancreas, a tenth subject was imaged on a PET/CT device. RESULTS: Brain had high uptake ( approximately 11% of injected activity (IA)) at 10 min. Although liver had the highest uptake ( approximately 35% IA at 120 min), excretion of this activity was not visible in gall bladder or intestine during the scanning session. Organs which received the highest doses (microSv/MBq) were pancreas (32.0), liver (18.4), and spleen (14.5). The effective dose of (1)(1)C-CUMI-101 was 5.3+/-0.5 microSv/MBq. CONCLUSION: The peak brain uptake ( approximately 11% IA) of (1)(1)C-CUMI-101 is the highest among more than twenty (1)(1)C-labeled ligands reported in the literature and provides good counting statistics from relatively low injected activities. Similar to that of other (1)(1)C-labeled ligands for brain imaging, the effective dose of (1)(1)C-CUMI-101 is 5.3+/-0.5 microSv/MBq, a value that can now be used to estimate the radiation risks in future research studies.
