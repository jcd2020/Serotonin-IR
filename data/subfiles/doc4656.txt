	In the present study, we examined changes in the firing rate and firing pattern of putative slow-spiking (SS) and fast-spiking (FS) interneurons in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the effect of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT(3)) receptor agonist SR 57227A on the neuronal firing in rats with 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) by using extracellular recording. The lesion of the SNc in rats decreased the firing rate of FS interneurons and the firing pattern of both SS and FS interneurons changed towards a more burst-firing. Systemic administration of SR 57227A (40-640 microg/kg, i.v.) increased the firing rate of SS interneurons, and decreased FS interneurons in sham-operated and the lesioned rats, respectively. The doses producing excitation or inhibition in the lesioned rats were higher than sham-operated rats. The local application of SR 57227A (0.01 microg) in mPFC excited SS interneurons, and inhibited FS interneurons in sham-operated rats, while having no effects on firing rate in the lesioned rats. Systemic administration of GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (2 mg/kg, i.v.) excited FS interneurons in sham-operated rats, whereas bicuculline did not change the activity of FS interneurons in the lesioned rats. Our findings indicate that the putative SS and FS interneurons activity is modulated through activation of 5-HT(3) receptor by direct or indirect action, and the lesion of the SNc leads to changes in firing activity of the SS and FS interneurons and decreased response of these interneurons to SR 57227A, suggesting dysfunction and/or down-regulation of 5-HT(3) receptor on interneurons in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats.
