Costall, B., et al. (1987). "Effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, GR38032F, on raised dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic system of the rat and marmoset brain." Br J Pharmacol 92(4): 881-894.

	1 The ability of the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist GR38032F to reduce raised mesolimbic dopaminergic activity was studied in behavioural experiments in the rat and marmoset. 2 GR38032F injected into the nucleus accumbens (0.01-1 ng) or peripherally (0.01-1 mg kg-1 i.p.) inhibited the locomotor hyperactivity caused by the acute intra-accumbens injection of amphetamine (10 micrograms) in the rat. Similar treatments with sulpiride and fluphenazine also inhibited the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. 3 The peripheral administration of GR38032F (0.001-0.1 mg kg-1 i.p., b.d.) during a 13 day period of dopamine infusion (25 micrograms 24 h-1) into the nucleus accumbens of the rat reduced the dopamine-induced hyperactivity response to control (vehicle infused) levels. Locomotor activity remained at control levels after discontinuing the dopamine/GR38032F treatment regimen. 4 The hyperactivity caused by the infusion of dopamine into the rat nucleus accumbens was also inhibited by fluphenazine (0.01-0.05 mg kg-1 i.p., b.d.), but locomotor activity was suppressed to levels below control values and a rebound hyperactivity occurred after discontinuation of the dopamine/fluphenazine treatment regimen. 5 The discontinuation of a concomitant 13 day intra-accumbens infusion of dopamine with haloperidol, 0.01 mg kg-1 i.p.t.d.s., caused a rebound hyperactivity. This hyperactivity was suppressed by GR38032F (0.001-0.1 mg kg-1 i.p.). 6 The unilateral infusion of dopamine (25 micrograms 24 h-1, 13 days) into the left amygdala of rats having right hemispheric dominance (as measured in a turn preference test) caused locomotor hyperactivity. Intraperitoneal administration of GR38032F (0.1-100 micrograms kg-1) or fluphenazine (0.025-0.1 mg kg-1), and the intra-amygdaloid injection of GR38032F (0.1-100 ng) or fluphenazine (25-500 pg), either into the infused or non-infused side, inhibited the dopamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity. 7 Marmosets receiving bilaterial infusions of dopamine (25 micrograms 24 h-1 for 13 days) into the nucleus accumbens also exhibited increased locomotor activity, GR38032F (0.1-1.0 micrograms kg-1 t.d.s.), reduced the hyperactivity to control levels with no rebound hyperactivity following the discontinuation of the dopamine/GR38032F treatment regimen. Fluphenazine (0.01-2.5 mg kg-1 i.p., t.d.s.) also inhibited the hyperactivity, but locomotor activity was reduced to values below control levels and a rebound hyperactivity followed the discontinuation of the dopamine/fluphenazine treatment. 8. It is concluded that the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist GR38032F, and the neuroleptic agents fluphenazine, sulpiride and haloperidol, can reduce raised mesolimbic dopaminergic activity in the rat and marmoset. GR38032F is distinguished from the dopamine receptor antagonists by, firstly, its ability to return the hyperactivity response to control values, without excessive suppression of locomotion even on enhanced dosage regimes and, secondly, by the lack of rebound hyperactivity following abrupt discontinuation of its treatment.
