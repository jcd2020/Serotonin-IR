Plaznik, A., et al. (1994). "ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT AND LIMBIC SEROTONERGIC MECHANISMS REGULATING RAT LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 48(2): 315-325.

	The effects of chronic administration of desipramine, citalopram, and electroconvulsive shocks (ECS) on changes in rat motility after intraaccumbens (NAS) injections of selective serotonergic drugs were studied in intact and 5.7-DHT lesioned animals. It was shown that local injections of 8-OHDPAT and DOI-HCl depressed rat locomotor activity. Their effects appeared to be mediated postsynaptically, and could be antagonized by NAN-190 and ritanserin, respectively. Chronic but not acute pretreatment of rats with antidepressants (21 days long; the experiment was performed 24 h after the last dose) as well as repeated ECS (shocks were applied five times every second day), antagonized behavioral depression after 8-OHDPAT and DOI-HCl. The influence of antidepressant treatment was prevented by serotonergic lesions. Chronic administration of antidepressants and ECS did not equivocally affect the levels or metabolism of 5-HT, dopamine, and noradrenaline in the rat limbic forebrain. It is concluded that the present data indicate diminished activity of 5-HT systems related to the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors in the limbic nucleus, after chronic antidepressant treatment. This effect of drugs and ECS concerns nervous processes linked with the function of postsynaptically localized 5-HT receptor subtypes, and it probably depends on intact presynaptic 5-HT innervation.
