Cook, D. F. and D. Wirtshafter (2000). "Quinpirole attenuates the striatal immediate early gene expression, but not the hyperactivity, induced by the serotonin agonist RU-24969." Brain Research 852(2): 247-254.

	Systemic administration of the mixed 5-HT1A/1B agonist RU-24969 has been shown to produce a dramatic increase in locomotor activity and to induce robust c-Fos expression in the rat striatum. Previous studies have also shown that pretreatment with the D-2-like dopamine agonist quinpirole virtually abolishes RU-24969-induced striatal c-Fos expression. The present study was undertaken to determine whether the effects of RU-24969 on immediate early gene expression extend to the additional Fos family transcription factors FosB and Fra-2. Additionally, this study quantitatively examined the effect of quinpirole pretreatment on the ability of RU-24969 to induce both locomotor hyperactivity and striatal immediate early gene expression. RU-24969 alone produced elevations in locomotor activity and induced clear expression of c-Fos, FosB and Fra-2 throughout the entire striatal complex. Quinpirole pretreatment virtually abolished RU-24969-induced expression of all three transcription factors, but did not alter the elevated locomotor activity produced by RU-24969. These results demonstrate that the effects of RU-24969 on locomotor activity can be dissociated from its effects on immediate early gene expression within the striatum. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.
