	D-lysergic diethylamide (LSD) is a hallucinogenic drug that interacts with the serotonin (5-HT)" system binding to 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors. Little is known about its potential interactions with the dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Using in-vivo electrophysiology in male adult rats, we evaluated the effects of cumulative doses of LSD on VTA DA neuronal activity, compared these effects to those produced on 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), and attempted to identify the mechanism of action mediating the effects of LSD on VTA DA neurons. LSD, at low doses (5-20 mu g/kg, i.v.) induced a significant decrease of DRN 5-HT firing activity through 5-HT2A and D-2 receptors. At these low doses, LSD did not alter VTA DA neuronal activity. On the contrary, at higher doses (30-120 mu g/kg, i.v.), LSD dose-dependently decreased VTA DA firing activity. The depletion of 5-HT with p-chlorophenylalanine did not modulate the effects of LSD on DA firing activity. The inhibitory effects of LSD on VTA DA firing activity were prevented by the D-2 receptor antagonist haloperidol (50 mu g/kg, i.v.) and by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 (500 mu g/kg, i.v.). Notably, pretreatment with the trace amine-associate receptor I (TAAR(1)) antagonist EPPTB (5 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked the inhibitory effect of LSD on VTA DA neurons. These results suggest that LSD at high doses strongly affects DA mesolimbic neuronal activity in a 5-HT independent manner and with a pleiotropic mechanism of action involving 5-HT1A, D-2 and TAAR(1) receptors.
