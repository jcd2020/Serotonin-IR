	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) plays protective or detrimental roles in the development of ischemic damage. In the present study, we investigated the time-course changes in 5-HT1A receptor protein expression in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region after transient global cerebral ischemia. 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity in the stratum pyramidale (SP) of the CA1 region was decreased from 6 h and hardly observed 1 and 2 days after ischemic insult. Five and 10 days after ischemia/reperfusion, 5-HT1A receptor immunoreactivity was increased and detected in astrocyte of the ischemic CA1 region. Furthermore, the pattern of changes in 5-HT1A receptor protein levels in the CA1 region after ischemia-reperfusion was similar to that observed in the immunohistochemical data. These results indicate that 5-HT1A receptor protein expressions may be related with the ischemia-induced neuronal death and the function of astrocytes in the ischemic hippocampal CA1 region.
