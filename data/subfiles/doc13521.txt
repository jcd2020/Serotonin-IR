Williams, G. M., et al. (1992). "5-HT3 RECEPTORS ARE NOT INVOLVED IN THE MODULATION OF THE K+-EVOKED RELEASE OF H-3 5-HT FROM SPINAL-CORD SYNAPTOSOMES OF RAT." Neuropharmacology 31(8): 725-733.

	The ability of 5-HT3 receptor agonists to modulate the resting efflux or K+-evoked release of [H-3]5-HT from superfused synaptosomes from the spinal cord of the rat was investigated. Phenylbiguanide did not alter the resting efflux of [H-3]5-HIAA or [H-3]5-HT or modify the K+-evoked release of [H-3]5-HT. 2-Methyl-5-HT (10-mu-M) caused an increase in resting efflux of [H-3]5-HIAA, an effect that was blocked by the inhibitor of the uptake of 5-HT fluoxetine. No effect on K+-evoked release of tritium was observed. Bufotenine (100-1000 nM) increased the resting efflux of [H-3]5-HT and [H-3]5-HIAA. These effects were not antagonized by the 5-HT3 antagonist ICS 205-930 but were antagonized by fluoxetine. The drug ICS 205-930 (1-mu-M) did not alter resting efflux or block the ability of serotonin (30 and 100 nM) to decrease K+-evoked release of tritium. Quipazine, a potent antagonist of peripheral 5-HT3 receptors (subnanomolar concentrations), was also unable to alter resting or K+-evoked release of [H-3]5-HT. It did, however, attenuate the inhibitory effect 5-HT on K+-evoked release. The concentrations required were in the micromolar range, consistent with the ability of the drug to antagonize the 5-HT1B autoreceptor. These results support the idea that 5-HT3 receptors do not act as nerve terminal autoreceptors in the spinal cord of the rat.
