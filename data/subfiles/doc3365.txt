Fomina, M. K., et al. (2014). "[Effects of buspirone complex with glycyrrhizic acid on behavior of mice with anxious-depressive state]." Ross Fiziol Zh Im I M Sechenova 100(7): 808-819.

	We report here studies of the effects of subchronic administration of 5-HT1A receptor agonist buspirone and its novel complex with glycyrrhizic acid (GA) to C57BL/6J mice at the different stages of the anxious-depressive state formation, induced by conditions of social stress. The experiment of agents' administration during the conditions of stress (beginning with initial stage) showed that only complex had a protective effect revealed in prevention of the anxiety with the high level of mice communicativeness maintenance. At the stage when the anxious-depressive state is completely formed, buspirone and its complex with GA decreased mice motor activity however complex--less significantly. Here we discuss a possible mechanism of action of investigated agents on the background of changes in the sensitivity of 5-HT1A receptors, induced by the formation of the anxious-depressive state of mice with experience of social stress. Despite of different effects of agents depending on the stage of the anxious-depressive state development, novel buspirone complex with GA has some advantage over buspirone.
