Kaye, W. H., et al. (2001). "Altered serotonin 2A receptor activity in women who have recovered from bulimia nervosa." American Journal of Psychiatry 158(7): 1152-1155.

	Objective: The authors' goal was to confirm that brain serotonin (5-HT) alterations are present in patients who have recovered from bulimia nervosa. Positron emission tomography imaging with [F-18]altanserin was used to characterize binding of the 5-HT2A receptor, which might contribute to altered feeding, mood, or impulse control. Method: Nine women who had recovered from bulimia nervosa (they had no episodes of binge eating or purging, were at normal weight, and had regular menstrual cycles for more than 1 year) were compared with 12 female volunteers who had never had bulimia. Results: The healthy volunteers, but not the women who had recovered from bulimia nervosa, had an age-related decline in 5-HT2A binding. Women who had recovered from bulimia nervosa had a reduction of medial orbital frontal cortex 5-HT2A binding. Conclusions: The lack of age-related changes in 5-HT activity is further evidence of 5-HT alterations in subjects who have recovered from bulimia nervosa. In addition, vulnerabilities for eating disorders, impulse dyscontrol, and mood disturbances may involve 5-HT and frontal robe activity.
