	Positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to explore relationships between central neuroreceptor occupancy, psychotropic drug blood levels and clinical effects. Treatment with conventional neuroleptics induces high (70-90%) dopamine (D2)-receptor occupancy. The risk of extrapyramidal side effects increases at D2-receptor occupancies above 80%. Standard doses of clozapine induced a low (20-67%) D2-receptor occupancy, but very high (85-90%) 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2A)-receptor occupancy. The novel antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine induced high occupancy of both D2 and 5-HT2A receptors at suggested standard doses. The occurrence of extrapyramidal side effects in some patients in the higher dose ranges does not support the view that 5-HT2A-receptor occupancy completely prevents the development of extrapyramidal side effects. These results emphasize the need for further exploration of the low dose ranges of risperidone and olanzapine. A preliminary analysis of an ongoing PET study showed that a schizophrenic patient treated with sertindole at 20 mg/day had a D2-receptor occupancy of below 70%. Further studies are needed to show whether sertindole is the first new antipsychotic that induces low occupancy in the clinical dose range, suggesting a mechanism of action distinct from that of classical neuroleptics and analogous to that of clozapine.
