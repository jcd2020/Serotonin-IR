	Key proteins regulating serotonergic activity. specifically the serotonin transporter and 5-HT1A receptor. were examined in the midbrain raphe nuclei of young (3-4 months) and old (17-19 months) barristers (N=7-10/group) An age-related decrease in the maximal density of serotonin transporter sites labelled with [H-3]paroxetine (fmol/mg protein, Old: 396 +/- 13 Young: 487 +/- 27) was observed in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) but not the median raphe nucleus (MRN), Without affecting the affinity of [H-3]paroxetine. In the DRN and MRN, the stimulation of [S-35]GTPgammaS binding by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. or the number of 5-HT1A receptor sites labeled with [H-3]MPPF, was not different in old versus Young animals. Thus in the DRN, aging decreased serotonin transporter sites without changing 5-HT1A receptor activation of G proteins or 5-HT1A receptor density. In the CA(1) region of hippocampus, 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding was increased in the older animals (% above basal, Old: 141 +/- 21; Young: 81 +/- 17) without changing specific [H-3]MPPF binding Sites, suggesting that the capacity of 5-HT1A receptors to activate G proteins is enhanced. Aging also appears to enhance this capacity in the dentate gyrus, because this region exhibited a constant level of 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in spite of an age-related decrease in the number of [H-3]MPPF binding sites (fmol/mg protein, Old: 203 +/- 21: Young: 429 +/- 51).
