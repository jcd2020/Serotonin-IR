	Background and PurposeThe 5-HT3 receptor is a member of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel family and is pharmacologically targeted to treat irritable bowel syndrome and nausea/emesis. Furthermore, many antidepressants elevate extracellular concentrations of 5-HT. This study investigates the functional consequences of exposure of recombinant 5-HT(3)A receptors to agonists and antagonists. Experimental ApproachWe used HEK cells stably expressing recombinant 5-HT(3)A receptors and the ND7/23 (mouse neuroblastoma/dorsal root ganglion hybrid) cell line, which expresses endogenous 5-HT3 receptors. Surface expression of recombinant 5-HT(3)A receptors, modified to contain the bungarotoxin (BTX) binding sequence, was quantified using fluorescence microscopy to image BTX-conjugated fluorophores. Whole cell voltage-clamp electrophysiology was used to measure the density of current mediated by 5-HT(3)A receptors. Key Results5-HT(3)A receptors were up-regulated by the prolonged presence of agonists (5-HT and m-chlorophenylbiguanide) and antagonists (MDL-72222 and morphine). The up-regulation of 5-HT(3)A receptors by 5-HT and MDL-72222 was time- and concentration-dependent but was independent of newly translated receptors. The phenomenon was observed for recombinant rodent and human 5-HT(3)A receptors and for endogenous 5-HT3 receptors in neuronal ND7/23 cells. Conclusions and ImplicationsUp-regulation of 5-HT(3)A receptors, following exposure to either agonists or antagonists suggests that this phenomenon may occur in response to different therapeutic agents. Medications that elevate 5-HT levels, such as the antidepressant inhibitors of 5-HT reuptake and antiemetic inhibitors of 5-HT3 receptor function, may both raise receptor expression. However, this will require further investigation in vivo.
