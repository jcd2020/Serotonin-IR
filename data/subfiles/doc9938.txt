Schaus, J. M., et al. (1998). "Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of potent and orally active 5-HT4 receptor antagonists: indazole and benzimidazolone derivatives." J Med Chem 41(11): 1943-1955.

	A series of indole-3-carboxamides, indazole-3-carboxamides, and benzimidazolone-3-carboxamides was synthesized and evaluated for antagonist affinity at the 5-HT4 receptor in the rat esophagus. The endo-3-tropanamine derivatives in the indazole and benzimidazolone series possessed greater 5-HT4 receptor affinity than the corresponding indole analogues. 5-HT4 receptor antagonist affinity was further increased by alkylation at N-1 of the aromatic heterocycle. In a series of 1-isopropylindazole-3-carboxamides, replacement of the bicyclic tropane ring system with the monocyclic piperidine ring system or an acyclic aminoalkylene chain led to potent 5-HT4 receptor antagonists. In particular, those systems in which the basic amine was substituted with groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds showed increased 5-HT4 receptor antagonist activity. While some of these compounds displayed high affinity for other neurotransmitter receptors (in particular, 5-HT3, alpha1, and 5-HT2A receptors), as the conformational flexibility of the amine moiety increased, the selectivity for the 5-HT4 receptor also increased. From this series of compounds, we identified LY353433 (1-(1-methylethyl)-N-[2-[4-[(tricyclo[3.3.1.1(3, 7)]dec-1-ylcarbonyl)amino]-1-piperidinyl]ethyl]-1H-indazole-3- carboxamide) as a potent and selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist with clinically suitable pharmacodynamics.
