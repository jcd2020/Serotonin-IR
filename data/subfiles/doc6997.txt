Martin, K. F., et al. (1992). "OPPOSING ROLES FOR 5-HT1B AND 5-HT3 RECEPTORS IN THE CONTROL OF 5-HT RELEASE IN RAT HIPPOCAMPUS INVIVO." British Journal of Pharmacology 106(1): 139-142.

	1 Intracerebral microdialysis was used to determine whether 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release in the ventral hippocampus of rats anaesthetized with chloral hydrate was modulated by 5-HT3 receptors. 2 It was confirmed that 5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole (RU 24969), a selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist, decreased 5-HT release in a dose- and concentration-related manner when administered i.p. (1 and 5 mg kg-1) or via the dialysis probe (0.1 and 1-mu-M) respectively. The effect of RU 24969 infusion (1-mu-M) was attenuated by concurrent infusion of metitepine (10-mu-M) into the hippocampus. 3 When infused into the hippocampus for 15 min, the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist, 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (2-methyl-5-HT, 0.1- 10-mu-M) increased dialysate 5-HT levels in a concentration-related manner; an effect which was abolished by concurrent infusion of 3-tropanyl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (1-mu-M, MDL 72222), a selective 5-HT3 antagonist. 4 MDL 72222 had no effects on hippocampal 5-HT release when administered via the dialysis probe (1 or 10-mu-M). 5 The data show that 5-HT3 and 5-HT1B receptors have opposing roles in the control of 5-HT release in the hippocampus, with 5-HT3 receptors facilitating and 5-HT1B receptors inhibiting 5-HT efflux, respectively. They also indicate that the facilitatory 5-HT3 receptors are not tonically activated.
