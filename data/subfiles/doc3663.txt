	This study evaluated the effect of 3-(4-fluorophenylselenyl)-2,5-diphenylselenophene (DPS) in the mouse forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), two assays predictive of depressant activity. The involvement of serotonergic system in the effect caused by DPS was studied. The antidepressant-like effect of combined treatment with subeffetive doses of DPS and paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) was investigated. Further, we verified the possible mechanism responsible for antidepressive-like effect of DPS. The results show that DPS (50 and 100 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly reduced the immobility time during the FST and TST, without accompanying changes in ambulation when assessed in the open-field test. The anti-immobility effect of DPS (50 mg/kg, p.o.) in the FST was prevented by pretreatment of mice with pCPA (100 mg/kg, i.p., once a day for 4 consecutive days, an inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis), WAY 100635 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c., a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist), ritanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) or ondansetron (1 mg/kg, i.p., a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist). Combined treatment with paroxetine and DPS reduced the immobility time in the FST. DPS at the doses of 10-100 mg/kg did not produce any change in the cerebral activity of MAO-A or MAO-B. DPS at the dose of 50 mg/kg inhibited significantly 5-HT uptake in synaptosomes. These results suggest that DPS produced an antidepressant-like effect in the mouse FST and TST and this effect seems most likely to be mediated through an interaction with serotonergic system, particularly by 5-HT reuptake inhibition.
