Brikas, P., et al. (1994). "TYPES OF SEROTONERGIC RECEPTORS INVOLVED IN THE CONTROL OF RETICULORUMINAL MYOELECTRIC ACTIVITY IN SHEEP." Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics 17(5): 345-352.

	The effects of peripheral (intravenous, i.v.) and central (intracerebroventricular, ICV) administrations of agonists of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors were investigated in conscious sheep chronically fitted with intraparietal electrodes on the reticulum and the dorsal, ventral and caudo-ventral rumen. The 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin increased reticular and decreased ruminal spike burst frequency when given i.v. (80 mug/kg) and ICV (8 mug/kg). The 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 agonists, alpha-methylserotonin and 2-methylserotonin, induced a moderate inhibition of rumino-reticular contractions when given i.v. at 100 and 150 mug/kg, respectively, while marked inhibition was observed after ICV administration at doses of 10 and 5 mug/kg, respectively. The 5-HT4 agonist 5-methoxytryptamine strongly stimulated rumino-reticular motility by the ICV (10 mug/kg) route, whereas it induced a moderate inhibition when administered i.v. (200 mug/kg). The selective antagonist of 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, spiroxatrine, ritanserin, granisetron and DAU 6285, respectively, blocked the responses of the respective agonists given by the same route. Moreover, the antagonists given ICV blocked the effects of the agonists given i.v. except for DAU 6285 ICV, which did not antagonize the inhibition induced by 5-methoxytryptamine i.v. It is concluded that the four types of serotonergic receptors investigated control rumino-reticular motility at the central level. However, according to the receptor type and the forestomach area (reticulum or rumen) this control may be stimulatory or inhibitory, demonstrating a pleiotropic role of serotonin in the control of rumino-reticular motility in sheep.
