Salichon, N., et al. (2001). "Excessive activation of serotonin (5-HT) 1B receptors disrupts the formation of sensory maps in monoamine oxidase a and 5-ht transporter knock-out mice." J Neurosci 21(3): 884-896.

	Deficiency in the monoamine degradation enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) or prenatal exposure to the monoamine uptake inhibitor cocaine alters behavior in humans and rodents, but the mechanisms are unclear. In MAOA knock-out mice, inhibiting serotonin synthesis during development can prevent abnormal segregation of axons in the retinogeniculate and somatosensory thalamocortical systems. To investigate this effect, we crossed MAOA knock-outs with mice lacking the serotonin transporter 5-HTT or the 5-HT1B receptor, two molecules present in developing sensory projections. Segregation was abnormal in 5-HTT knock-outs and MAOA/5-HTT double knock-outs but was normalized in MAOA/5-HT1B double knock-outs and MAOA/5-HTT/5-HT1B triple knock-outs. This demonstrates that the 5-HT1B receptor is a key factor in abnormal segregation of sensory projections and suggests that serotonergic drugs represent a risk for the development of these projections. We also found that the 5-HT1B receptor has an adverse developmental impact on beam-walking behavior in MAOA knock-outs. Finally, because the 5-HT1B receptor inhibits glutamate release, our results suggest that visual and somatosensory projections must release glutamate for proper segregation.
