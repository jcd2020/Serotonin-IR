Zubkov, E. A., et al. (2008). "[Chronic effect of thyroxine on behavior and brain serotonin receptors in mice with the sharp difference in predisposition to catalepsy]." Zh Vyssh Nerv Deiat Im I P Pavlova 58(4): 493-499.

	Effects of chronic thyroxine treatment (2mg/l, 60 days) on catalepsy, functional activity and expression of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors genes in the brain were studied in adult males of catalepsy-prone ASC and catalepsy-resistant AKR mouse strains. Thyroxine caused an appearance of cataleptics in AKR, but produced an anticataleptic effect on ASC mice. Chronic thyroxine treatment increased the functional activity and expression of 5-HT(2A) receptors in the frontal cortex in AKR, but not in ASC mice. Hormone markedly attenuated hypothermic effect of 8-OH-DPAT, 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, but did not affect the expression of 5-HT(1A) receptors in ASC mice. The results suggest the involvement of the 5-HT(2A) receptors in the cataleptogenic and the 5-HT(1A) receptors in the anticataleptic effects of hormone.
