Sinclair-Worley, L. and L. Uphouse (2004). "Effect of estrogen on the lordosis-inhibiting action of ketanserin and SB 206553." Behav Brain Res 152(1): 129-135.

	The effects of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, ketanserin, and the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, SB 206553, on lordosis behavior were investigated in ovariectomized rats hormonally primed with estradiol benzoate (EB) (0.5 or 25 mug) and progesterone (500 mug). Both ketanserin and SB 206553 inhibited lordosis behavior after infusion into the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN), but ketanserin was slightly more effective than the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist. Either drug was more effective in rats primed with 0.5 mug EB than in rats hormonally primed with 25 mug EB. These findings support the suggestion that estrogen may enhance functioning of the 5-HT2 receptor family and thereby protect against the 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. These data are consistent with prior suggestions that estrogen modulates functioning of 5-HT2 receptors within the VMN and that 5-HT2 receptors play a facilitatory role in the modulation of female rat lordosis behavior.
