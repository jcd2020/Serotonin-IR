Uphouse, L., et al. (2007). "Serotonin receptor involvement in effects of restraint on female rat lordosis behavior." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 86(4): 631-636.

	Ovariectomized Fischer (CDF-344) rats, with bilateral cannulae in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) near the ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMN), were used to test the hypothesis that serotonin receptors in the VMN contribute to the lordosis-inhibiting effects of mild restraint. Rats were hormonally primed with 10 microg estradiol benzoate (EB) followed 48 h later with sesame seed oil. Four to six hours later (during the dark portion of the light-dark cycle), rats were pretested for sexual behavior. Thereafter, they were infused with saline, 2 microg of the serotonin (5-HT) 2 receptor agonist, (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI), or 1 microg of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, N-{2[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY100635). After a 5 min restraint, rats were tested for sexual receptivity. Rats infused with saline showed a significant decline in lordosis behavior after restraint. Infusion with either DOI or WAY100635 attenuated these effects of restraint. These findings extend earlier observations that the lordosis-disruptive effects of mild restraint include activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the VMN and are the first to implicate VMN 5-HT(2) receptors in protection against mild restraint.
