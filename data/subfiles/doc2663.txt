	Although the role of serotonin (5HT) in the regulation of anterior pituitary hormone secretion is well documented, the involvement of specific 5HT receptor subtypes in this action is not yet fully elucidated. In the present work we attempted to determine the neuroendocrine role of the 5HT1A receptor subtype. This was chosen mainly because highly selective pharmacological tools are available for that subtype. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8OHDPAT) and ipsapirone were injected iv in conscious, freely moving male rats cannulated in the jugular vein. For the sake of comparison, a 5HT receptor agonist with preference for the 5HT1B and 5HT1C receptor subtypes 1-(m-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazine (TFMPP) was also administered. Plasma PRL, ACTH, and beta-endorphin levels increased in a dose-dependent manner after 8-OHDPAT (0.01-1 mg/kg) or ipsapirone (0.5-7.5 mg/kg) injection. Maximal effects were obtained between 7-15 min. Only the highest dose of 1-(m-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)piperazine (5 mg/kg) resulted in the same response. In contrast, none of the drugs used affected plasma GH, TSH, or LH levels at any dose tested. The results indicate that 5HT1A receptors are involved in the regulation of PRL as well as ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion. 8OHDPAT was almost 40 times more potent than ipsapirone. The maximal effects of the two drugs on PRL release were comparable. In contrast, ipsapirone behaved as a partial agonist only on ACTH and beta-endorphin secretion, thus suggesting that different neuronal targets are involved in the stimulation of the three hormones by 5HT.
