	The aim of the present study was to resolve which hypothalamic nucleus is necessary for the serotonergic control of renin secretion. RU 24969 is considered a serotonin (5-HT1A/5-HT1B) agonist, while p-chloroamphetamine is a 5-HT releaser. Both drugs reliably elevate plasma levels of renin when injected peripherally. Previous studies suggest that serotonergic neurons, projecting to the hypothalamus, mediate the effect of p-chloroamphetamine on renin secretion. Discrete cell-selective lesions were made with ibotenic acid in three hypothalamic sites: the paraventricular, the dorsomedial or the ventromedial nuclei. Two weeks after surgery rats were injected with RU 24969 (5 mg/kg, i.p.) or p-chloroamphetamine (8 mg/kg, i.p.). The renin response to both RU 24969 and p-chloroamphetamine was significantly reduced in rats with histologically verified paraventricular lesions compared to vehicle treated controls. In contrast, the renin response to p-chloroamphetamine remained unchanged in rats with either dorsomedial or ventromedial hypothalamic lesions. Thus, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that 5-HT receptors located on cell bodies in the paraventricular nucleus mediate the renin response to a serotonin agonist and releaser. Furthermore, they confirm previous studies that suggest that 5-HT neurons regulate renin secretion through central receptors.
