	Neurotensin-like peptides acting as functional antagonists of serotonin receptors were revealed in the head-shaking test on mice. The neurotensin-like peptides block the serotonin-induced platelet aggregation in humans. Radioligand binding assay showed that neurotensin-like peptides modulate specifi c binding of 5capital EN, Cyrilliccapital TE, Cyrillic2 serotonin receptor antagonist ketanserin, but have no effect on binding of ligands of 5HT2c receptor mesulergine and 5HT1small a, Cyrillic receptors NAN-190. Similar effects of neurotensin-like peptides in the experiments in vivo and in vitro suggest that the mechanisms of the detected antipsychotic effect of the peptides can be mediated by serotonin receptors.
