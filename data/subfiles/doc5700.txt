	5-HT neurons are topographically organized in the hindbrain, and have been implicated in the etiology and treatment of psychiatric diseases such as depression and anxiety. Early studies suggested that the raphe 5-HT neurons were a homogeneous population showing similar electrical properties, and feedback inhibition mediated by 5-HT1A autoreceptors. We utilized histochemistry techniques in ePet1-eGFP and 5-HT1A-iCre/R26R mice to show that a subpopulation of 5-HT neurons do not express the somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor mRNA. In addition, we performed patch-clamp recordings followed by single-cell PCR in ePet1-eGFP mice. From 134 recorded 5-HT neurons located in the dorsal, lateral, and median raphe, we found lack of 5-HT1A mRNA expression in 22 cells, evenly distributed across raphe subfields. We compared the cellular characteristics of these neuronal types and found no difference in passive membrane properties and general excitability. However, when injected with large depolarizing current, 5-HT1A-negative neurons fired more action potentials, suggesting a lack of autoinhibitory action of local 5-HT release. Our results support the hypothesis that the 5-HT system is composed of subpopulations of serotonergic neurons with different capacity for adaptation.
