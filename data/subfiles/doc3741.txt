Gidda, J. S., et al. (1995). "ANTAGONISM OF SEROTONIN(3) (5-HT3) RECEPTORS WITHIN THE BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER PREVENTS CISPLATIN-INDUCED EMESIS IN DOGS." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 273(2): 695-701.

	Recently discovered serotonin, (5-HT3) receptor antagonists are potent antiemetics in cytotoxic drug-induced vomiting. The specific site where 5-HT3 receptor antagonists act to abolish emesis is controversial. The major objective of this study was to determine whether the antiemetic effect of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists is exerted in the brain areas that reside inside or outside of the blood-brain barrier. Tropisetron, zatosetron (LY277359 maleate) and its quaternary analog zatosetron-QUAT were used in this study. Zatosetron and zatosetron-QUAT showed high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT3 receptors in radioligand binding studies. Both compounds antagonized 5-HT-induced bradycardia in rats with an approximate ID50 of 0.7 and 0.2 mu g/kg i.v., respectively. Zatosetron and tropisetron significantly inhibited cisplatin-evoked emesis in dogs (estimated ID50 values of 34.4 +/- 2.3 mu g/kg and 108.3 +/- 4.8 mu g/kg i.v., respectively). Zatosetron-QUAT (0.01-1.0 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect. [C-14]-zatosetron-QUAT (100 mu g/kg) was not detected in the brain after i.v. administration to rats, consistent with the inability of charged compounds to achieve significant brain concentrations. However, i.c.v. administration (100 ng/kg) of zatosetron-QUAT reduced emetic episodes significantly (11.6 +/- 1.6 vs. 2.8 +/- 1.2). These studies suggest that, in dogs, antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors located within the blood-brain barrier is important to block cisplatin-induced emesis.
