Santana, L., et al. (2002). "Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of new arylpiperazines: para substitution with electron-withdrawing groups decrease binding to 5-HT1A and D-2A receptors." European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 37(6): 503-510.

	Compounds in which N-phenylpiperazines were linked by a propyloxy chain to position 6 or 7 of a coumarin ring were designed and synthesised, and their affinities for 5-HT1A and D-2A receptors were determined by radioligand binding assays. The influence of para substitution in the phenyl ring, substitution at position 4 of the coumarin system, and the coumarin position at which the piperazinylalkyl chain is linked was explored. Electron-withdrawing phenyl ring substituents para to the piperazine strongly reduced activity at both receptors. Binding at 5HT(1A) was influenced by the bulk of substituents at position 4 of the coumarin system, and binding at D-2A by their electronic properties. Neither binding affinity was significantly affected by whether the piperazinylalkyl chain was inserted at position 6 or 7 of the coumarin system.
