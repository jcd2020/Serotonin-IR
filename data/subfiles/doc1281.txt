Bolognini, D., et al. (2013). "Cannabidiolic acid prevents vomiting in Suncus murinus and nausea-induced behaviour in rats by enhancing 5-HT1A receptor activation." Br J Pharmacol 168(6): 1456-1470.

	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) to reduce nausea and vomiting and enhance 5-HT(1A) receptor activation in animal models. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the effect of CBDA on (i) lithium chloride (LiCl)-induced conditioned gaping to a flavour (nausea-induced behaviour) or a context (model of anticipatory nausea) in rats; (ii) saccharin palatability in rats; (iii) motion-, LiCl- or cisplatin-induced vomiting in house musk shrews (Suncus murinus); and (iv) rat brainstem 5-HT(1A) receptor activation by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and mouse whole brain CB(1) receptor activation by CP55940, using [(3)(5)S]GTPgammaS-binding assays. KEY RESULTS: In shrews, CBDA (0.1 and/or 0.5 mg.kg(-)(1) i.p.) reduced toxin- and motion-induced vomiting, and increased the onset latency of the first motion-induced emetic episode. In rats, CBDA (0.01 and 0.1 mg.kg(-)(1) i.p.) suppressed LiCl- and context-induced conditioned gaping, effects that were blocked by the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, WAY100635 (0.1 mg.kg(-)(1) i.p.), and, at 0.01 mg.kg(-)(1) i.p., enhanced saccharin palatability. CBDA-induced suppression of LiCl-induced conditioned gaping was unaffected by the CB(1) receptor antagonist, SR141716A (1 mg.kg(-)(1) i.p.). In vitro, CBDA (0.1-100 nM) increased the E(max) of 8-OH-DPAT. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Compared with cannabidiol, CBDA displays significantly greater potency at inhibiting vomiting in shrews and nausea in rats, and at enhancing 5-HT(1A) receptor activation, an action that accounts for its ability to attenuate conditioned gaping in rats. Consequently, CBDA shows promise as a treatment for nausea and vomiting, including anticipatory nausea for which no specific therapy is currently available.
