Imai, S., et al. (1991). "DIFFERENT EFFECTS OF N-ETHYLMALEIMIDE ON THE BINDING CHARACTERISTICS OF 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE RECEPTOR SUBTYPES IN RAT-BRAIN MEMBRANES." Neurochemistry International 18(3): 331-339.

	To characterize 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes in the CNS in terms of their binding and coupling properties with GTP-binding proteins (G proteins), we examined the effects of serotonergic agents GTP-gamma-S and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), on the binding of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT. [I-125]iodocyanopindolol (ICYP), [H-3]mesulergine, [H-3]DOB and [H-3]ketanserin in rat brain membranes. [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, [I-125]ICYP, [H-3]mesulergine and [H-3]ketanserin are radiolabeled ligands for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites, respectively. Correlation of the values of the dissociation constants (K(D)) of the serotonergic agonists or antagonists was evaluated in two categories of 5-HT receptor subtypes. Highly significant correlations were found among 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D sites, and among 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 sites. A significantly reversed correlation was observed between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2. GTP-gamma-S caused a shift to the right on the 5-HT competition curve for the binding of [I-125]ICYP, [H-3]mesulergine or [H-3]ketanserin. Although NEM-treatment partially induced a right shift on the agonist competition curve for [I-125]ICYP binding, this treatment induced a left shift on the curve for [H-3]mesulergine and [H-3]ketanserin binding. In addition, the binding of [H-3]DOB, a 5-HT2 agonist, was increased by NEM-treatment. NEM seems to characterize agonist binding to the 5-HT receptor subtypes and the coupling of these subtypes to G proteins. These results suggest that 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors belong to one category, and 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptors belong to another category.
