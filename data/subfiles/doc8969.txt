Moser, P. C. (1992). "THE EFFECT OF 5-HT3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS ON THE DISCRIMINATIVE STIMULUS EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE." Eur J Pharmacol 212(2-3): 271-274.

	The discriminative stimulus induced in rats by amphetamine has previously been shown to be due to raised mesolimbic dopamine levels. As 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been shown to inhibit hyperactivity resulting from raised mesolimbic dopamine levels, the present study examined their effects against the amphetamine discriminative stimulus. None of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists tested (MDL 72,222EF, 0.3-10 mg/kg s.c.; MDL 73,147EF, 0.3-10 mg/kg s.c.; ICS 205-930, 0.01-10.0 mg/kg s.c.; ondansetron, 0.1-1000-mu-g/kg s.c.) antagonised the effects of amphetamine in this test. This suggests that 5-HT3 receptors cannot modulate the effects of raised mesolimbic dopamine in pathways involved in the interoceptive effects of amphetamine.
