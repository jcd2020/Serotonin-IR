Iba, H., et al. (2019). "Effect of Yokukansan and Yokukansankachimpihange on Aggressive Behavior, 5-HT Receptors and Arginine Vasopressin Expression in Social Isolation-Reared Mice." Biological & Pharmaceutical Bulletin 42(12): 2009-2015.

	The traditional herbal medicines yokukansan (YKS) and yokukansankachimpihange (YKSCH) are prescribed for neurosis, insomnia or night crying and irritability in children. YKSCH comprises YKS and two additional herbs, a chimpi and a hange, and is used to treat digestive function deficiencies. However, the differences between the effects of YKS and YKSCH on brain function are unclear. The present study examined the effects of YKS and YKSCH on aggressive behavior in mice reared under a social isolation (SI) condition. Mice were housed individually for 6 weeks. YKS and YKSCH were administered orally for 2 weeks before aggression tests. SI increased aggressive behavior against naive mice, and YKS, but not YKSCH, significantly attenuated this aggressive behavior. Because serotonin (5-HT)(2A) and 5-HT3A receptor antagonists are reported to have anti-aggressive effects, the mRNA levels of these receptors were examined. YKS attenuated the SI-induced increase in 5-HT2A and 5-HT3A receptor mRNA in the amygdala. On the other hand, YKSCH attenuated the SI-induced increase in 5-HT1A receptor mRNA. YKS and YKSCH did not affect 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid content in the amygdala. However, YKSCH increased the mRNA level of arginine vasopressin (AVP), which is a neuropeptide that has been implicated in aggression, in the amygdala. These results suggest that YKS ameliorates aggressive behavior by decreasing 5-HT2A and 5-HT3A receptor expression. The YKSCH-induced increase in AVP may disrupt the anti-aggressive effect of YKS. YKS may be more effective than YKSCH for treating irritability if digestive function deficiencies are not considered.
