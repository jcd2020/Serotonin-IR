Bellido, I., et al. (2002). "S-adenosyl-L-methionine prevents 5-HT(1A) receptors up-regulation induced by acute imipramine in the frontal cortex of the rat." Neurosci Lett 321(1-2): 110-114.

	S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) has shown efficacy in speeding the onset of the antidepressant effect of imipramine in depressed patients. This effect may be related to their interactions at the serotonin(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptors. Acute imipramine up-regulated the frontal cortex 5-HT(1A) receptors (B(max), 51.5 +/- 8.4 fmol/mg protein) vs. saline (B(max), 27.5 +/- 5.9 fmol/mg protein), and did not show antidepressant effect. Acute SAM and imipramine+SAM did not modify frontal cortex 5-HT(1A) receptors, and showed antidepressant effects (decrease of the immobility response of 26%, P<0.01; and 47%, P<0.001) vs. saline. All the chronic treatments showed antidepressant effects and up-regulated the hippocampus 5-HT(1A) receptors. SAM prevents the 5-HT(1A) receptor up-regulation induced by acute imipramine in the frontal cortex. This mechanism may contribute to imipramine's antidepressant effect.
