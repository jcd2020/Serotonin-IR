	The purpose of this research is to find optimal acquisition time point of [F-18]FCWAY PET for the assessment of serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1A) density. To achieve this goal, we examined the specific-to-nonspecific ratios in various brain regions. The cerebellum has very few 5-HT1A receptors in the brain, so we set this region as the reference tissue. As a result, specific-to-nonspecific binding ratios in the frontal, temporal cortex and the hippocampus were steadily increased at 90 min after injection and remained stable at 120 min. In addition, the binding ratio of the late time was significantly higher than that of the previous time points. From these results, we recommend that 90 min p.i. is a better single time point for the analysis rather than previous time points for assessing [F-18]FCWAY binding to 5-HT1A receptors.
