	The pharmacokinetics and in vivo potency of 6-hydroxybuspirone (6-OH-buspirone), a major metabolite of buspirone, were investigated. The plasma clearance (47.3 +/- 3.5 ml/min/kg), volume of distribution (2.6 +/- 0.3 l/kg), and half-life (1.2 +/- 0.2 h) of 6-OH-buspirone in rats were similar to those for buspirone. Bioavailability was higher for 6-OH-buspirone (19%) compared with that for buspirone (1.4%). After intravenous infusions to steady-state levels in plasma, 6-OH-buspirone and buspirone increased 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)(1A) receptor occupancy in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 values of 1.0 +/- 0.3 and 0.38 +/- 0.06 mu M in the dorsal raphe and 4.0 +/- 0.6 and 1.5 +/- 0.3 mu M in the hippocampus, respectively. Both compounds appeared to be similar to 4-fold more potent in occupying presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the dorsal raphe than the postsynaptic receptors in the hippocampus. Oral dosing of buspirone in rats resulted in exposures (area under the concentration-time profile) of 6-OH-buspirone and 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-piperazine (1-PP), another major metabolite of buspirone, that were similar to 12 (6-OH-buspirone)- and 49 (1-PP)-fold higher than the exposure of the parent compound. As a whole, these preclinical data suggest that 6-OH-buspirone probably contributes to the clinical efficacy of buspirone as an anxiolytic agent.
