Moreland, R. B., et al. (2004). "H-3 A-369508 ( 2- 4-(2-cyanophenyl)-1-piperazinyl -N-(3-methylphenyl) acetamide): an agonist radioligand selective for the dopamine D-4 receptor." European Journal of Pharmacology 497(2): 147-154.

	Tritiation of the dopamine D-4 receptor selective agonist A-369508 ([2-[4-(2-cyanophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-N-(3-methylphenyl) acetamide) has provided a radioligand for the characterization of dopamine D4 receptors. [3 H] A-369508 binds with high affinity to the major human dopamine D-4 receptor variants D-4.2, D-4.4 and D-4.7 (K-d = 1.7, 4, and 1.2 nM, respectively). It also binds to the rat dopamine D4 receptor, (K-d=4.4 nM), implying similar binding affinity across human and rat receptors. A-369508 shows >400-fold selectivity over D-2L, >350-fold selectivity over 5-HT1A and >700-1000-fold selectivity over all other receptors tested. Agonist activity determined by inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human dopamine D-4.4 receptor (EC50=7.5 nM, intrinsic activity=0.71) indicates that A-369508 is a potent agonist at the human dopamine D-4 receptor. Similar data was observed in other functional assays. [H-3] A369508 binds to a single, high affinity site on membranes containing the human dopamine D-4.4 receptor. When compared to the D-2-like antagonist [H-3] spiperone, competition binding for agonists like dopamine and apomorphine were 2-10-fold more potent with [H-3] A369508, while the antagonists clozapine, haloperidol and L-745870 bind with similar affinity to both ligands. Binding to rat brain regions demonstrated that the most abundant area was cerebral cortex (51.2 fmol/mg protein) followed by hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. [H-3] A-369508 is a useful tool to define the localization and physiological role of dopamine D-4 receptors in central nervous system and can facilitate measuring accurate affinities (K-i) for structure/activity relationship studies designed to identify dopamine D-4 receptor selective agonists.
