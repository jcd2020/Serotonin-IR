	The brain serotonin(2A) receptor (5-HT2AR) has been implicated in both the pathology of schizophrenia and the therapeutic action of many atypical antipsychotics. As atypical antipsychotics like clozapine antagonize the 5-HT2AR and reduce 5-HT2AR density, it cannot be ruled out that a prefrontal decrease of 5-HT2AR density observed in postmortem brains from patients with schizophrenia is triggered by antipsychotic drug effects. Today, little is known about the 5-HT2AR in vivo status before the first psychotic episode and before the exposure to antipsychotics. Into this void comes our pilot study in which we used the radioligand [F-18]altan-serin and positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate individuals at increased risk of developing schizophrenia. We identified decreases of 5-HT2AR availability in orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that disease-related abnormalities of serotonergic neurotransmission emerge in brain areas involved in affective and cognitive processes, dysfunctions of which are core representations of the schizophrenic phenotype.
