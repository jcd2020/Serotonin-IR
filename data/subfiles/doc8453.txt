Orlandini, E., et al. (2007). "Synthesis and 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A and alpha1-binding affinities of 2-[2-Hydroxy-3-(pyridin-3-yl-methyl)amino]-, 2-[2-hydroxy-3-(2-pyridin-2-yl-ethyl)amino]- and 2-[2-hydroxy-3-(4-N-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-amino]propoxybenzaldehyde-O-(substituted) benzyl oximes." Arch Pharm (Weinheim) 340(3): 135-139.

	Some oxime ether-substituted aryloxypropanolamines 3-5, structurally related to the active metabolite 2 of sarpogrelate 1, were synthesized and tested for their affinities at 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A serotoninergic receptors as well as at the alpha1-adrenoceptor. The results show that the compounds possess, at least partially, the ability of the model compounds 1 and 2 to interact with the 5-HT2A-receptors; they have the same selectivity towards 5-HT2A receptors vs alpha1-adrenoceptors.
