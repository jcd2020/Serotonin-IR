	The work described in this article is concerned with the role of the 5-HT1a receptor in mediating the neurotrophic effects of serotonin, principally through the release of the substance S-100 beta from astroglial cells. These receptors are also present in astrocytes of the mature brain and may play a role in the synaptic plasticity necessary for certain experience-driven brain changes, such as memory or learning. The presence of these receptors on astroglial cells of the adult brain also has interesting implications for the mechanism of action of many psychotropic drugs acting through the serotonergic system
