Mirski, M. A., et al. (2009). "Anticonvulsant serotonergic and deep brain stimulation in anterior thalamus." Seizure-European Journal of Epilepsy 18(1): 64-70.

	Objective: Anterior thalamus (AN) has been shown to mediate seizures in both focal and generalized models. Specific regional increase in AN serotonergic activity was observed following AN-DBS in our pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) rodent model of acute seizures, and this increase may inhibit seizures and contribute to the mechanism of anticonvulsant DBS. Methods: Anesthetized rats with AN-directed dialysis cannula with scalp/depth EEG were infused with PTZ at 5.5 mg/(kg min) until an EEG seizure occurred. Eight experimental groups of AN-dialysis infusion were evaluated: controls (dialysate-only), 10 and 100 mu M serotonin 5-HT(7) agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), 1, 10 and 100 mu M serotonin antagonist methysergide (METH), AN-DBS, and 100 mu M METH + AN-DBS. Results: Latency for seizures in control animals was 3120 +/- 770 s (S.D.); AN-DBS delayed onset to 5018 +/- 1100 (p < 0.01). AN-directed 5-CT increased latency in dose-dependent fashion: 3890 +/- 430 and 4247 +/- 528 (p < 0.05). Methysergide had an unexpected protective effect at low-dose (3908 +/- 550, p < 0.05) but not at 100 mu M (2687 +/- 1079). The anticonvulsant action of AN-DBS was blocked by prior dialysis using 100 mu M METH. Surface EEG burst count and nonlinear analysis (H-Statistic) noted significant (p < 0.05) increased pre-ictal epileptiform bursts in 5-CT, methysergide, but not DBS group compared to control. Conclusion: Increased serotonergic activity in AN raised PTZ seizure threshold, similar to DBS, but without preventing cortical bursting. 5-Carboxamidotryptamine, a 5-HT7 agonist, demonstrated dose-dependent seizure inhibition. Methysergide proved to have an inverse, dose-dependent agonist property, antagonizing the action of AN-DBS at the highest dose. Anticonvulsant AN-DBS may in part act to selectively alter serotonin neurotransmission to raise seizure threshold. (C) 2008 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
