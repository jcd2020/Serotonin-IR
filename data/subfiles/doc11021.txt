	We investigated the effects of oleamide, a fatty acid amide isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of sleep-deprived cats, on serotonin receptor-mediated signaling in cultured mammalian cells, Oleamide demonstrated opposing effects on 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 receptors, in rat pituitary cells and transfected HeLa cells, respectively, Oleamide caused a potentiation of 5-HT-elicited inositol phosphate formation mediated by the 5-HT2A receptor, but inhibited the effects of 5-HT on cAMP production mediated by the 5-HT7 receptor. In addition, oleamide alone caused a significant increase in cAMP accumulation that was dependent on the presence of the 5-HT7 receptor, but was not blocked by clozapine. These results demonstrate that oleamide can have diverse effects on 5-HT-mediated signal transduction at different subtypes of mammalian 5-HT receptors, Additionally, our data suggest that oleamide may act at an allosteric site on the 5-HT, receptor and can elicit functional responses via activation of this site.
