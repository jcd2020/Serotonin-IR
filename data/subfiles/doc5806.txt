Invernizzi, R. W., et al. (2003). "Flibanserin, a potential antidepressant drug, lowers 5-HT and raises dopamine and noradrenaline in the rat prefrontal cortex dialysate: role of 5-HT(1A) receptors." Br J Pharmacol 139(7): 1281-1288.

	(1) Using in vivo intracerebral microdialysis in conscious, freely moving rats, we examined the effect of flibanserin, a potential antidepressant drug with high affinity for human 5-HT(1A) receptors and four-50-fold lower affinity for 5-HT(2A) and D(4) receptors, on basal extracellular concentrations of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) in selected regions of the rat brain. (2) Flibanserin at 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) significantly reduced extracellular 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex (by 30 and 45%) and dorsal raphe (35 and 44%), but had no effect on extracellular 5-HT in the ventral hippocampus. The 3 and 10 mg kg(-1) doses raised extracellular NA to a similar extent in the prefrontal cortex (47 and 50%). In all, 10 mg kg(-1) raised extracellular DA in the prefrontal cortex (63%) whereas 3 mg kg(-1) had no significant effect. (3) Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY100,635 (0.3 mg kg(-1)) 30 min before 10 mg kg(-1) flibanserin completely antagonized the latter's effects on extracellular 5-HT, DA and NA in the prefrontal cortex. WAY100,635 by itself had no effect on cortical extracellular monoamines. (4) The results show that the stimulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors plays a major role in the effect of flibanserin on brain extracellular 5-HT, DA and NA.
