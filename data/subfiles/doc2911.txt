Edwards, G. L. and J. D. Power (1993). "ATTENUATION OF 8-OH-DPAT INDUCED FEEDING AFTER LESIONS OF THE AREA POSTREMA IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT NUCLEUS OF THE SOLITARY TRACT." Brain Research 628(1-2): 321-326.

	Rats with lesions of the area postrema/immediately adjacent nucleus of the solitary tract (AP/mNTS-lesions) have an attenuated feeding response after several manipulations that induce food intake in intact control rats. In this study we examined the ingestive response of rats with AP/mNTS-lesions after treatment with 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A agonist. Rats with AP/mNTS-lesions failed to increase their food intake after treatment with 8-OH-DPAT at doses that stimulated food intake in intact rats. These data suggest that altered serotonergic function may contribute to the attenuation of feeding observed in rats with AP/mNTS-lesions after treatment with some orexigenic stimuli.
