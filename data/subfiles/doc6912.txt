	Previous studies have shown that 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) can potently inhibit glutamatergic transmission in rat cerebellum through the activation of multiple 5-HT receptors. The aim of this study was to subclassify the 5-HT2 receptor mediating inhibition of the cyclic GMP response elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartate in adult rat cerebellar slices. Seven receptor antagonists, endowed with relative selectivities for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C subtypes, differentially affected the inhibition by (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane of the cyclic GMP response, suggesting that the receptor involved belongs to the 5-HT2C subtype.
