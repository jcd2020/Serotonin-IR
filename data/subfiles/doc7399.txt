	Sensory perception arises from the integration of externally and internally driven representations of the world. Disrupted balance of these representations can lead to perceptual deficits and hallucinations. The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) is associated with such perceptual alterations, both in its role in schizophrenia and in the action of hallucinogenic drugs. Despite this powerful influence on perception, relatively little is known about how serotonergic hallucinogens influence sensory processing in the neocortex. Using widefield and two-photon calcium imaging and single-unit electrophysiology in awake mice, we find that administration of the hallucinogenic selective 5-HT(2A)R agonist DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) leads to a net reduction in visual response amplitude and surround suppression in primary visual cortex, as well as disrupted temporal dynamics. However, basic retinotopic organization, tuning properties, and receptive field structure remain intact. Our results provide support for models of hallucinations in which reduced bottom-up sensory drive is a key factor leading to altered perception.
