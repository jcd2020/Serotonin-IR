Mokrosz, J. L., et al. (1992). "Structure-activity relationship studies of CNS agents. Part VIII. Bulk tolerance around the protonation center of 4-substituted 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazines at 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors." Pol J Pharmacol Pharm 44(6): 595-607.

	The effect of a steric hindrance around the protonation center of the model 4-substituted 1-(3-chlorophenyl)-piperazines 1-9 and 11-14 on their affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor sites was investigated. Additional evidence for hydrophobic interactions between the N-4 hydrocarbon substituents and 5-HT1A receptors has been presented. However, the hydrophobic forces play a minor role in stabilization of the bioactive complex with 5-HT2 receptors. It has also been found that even bulky substituents around the protonation center of 1-aryl-piperazines are well tolerated at both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 sites.
