Ennis, M. D., et al. (1995). "STRUCTURE-ACTIVITY-RELATIONSHIPS IN THE 8-AMINO-6,7,8,9-TETRAHYDRO-3H-BENZ E INDOLE RING-SYSTEM .2. EFFECT OF 8-AMINO NITROGEN SUBSTITUTION ON SEROTONIN RECEPTOR-BINDING AND PHARMACOLOGY." J Med Chem 38(12): 2217-2230.

	A series of analogs of the potent and selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-(di-n-propylamino)-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-3H-benz[e]indole-1-carbaldehyde (2b) (OSU191) was prepared in which the dipropylamino group was modified to bear a variety of substituents. These compounds were evaluated for both in vitro and in vivo effects, including the establishment of a receptor binding profile for these analogs at the 5-HT1A, dopamine D-2, dopamine D-3, 5-HT1D alpha, and 5-HT1D beta sites. Several of the analogs were evaluated for their biochemical effects in reserpinized rats, specifically with regard to in vivo changes in brain levels of 5-HTP and DOPA. Nearly all of the compounds prepared for this study were exceedingly potent at the 5-HT1A receptor, although most also displayed significant affinity for the dopamine D-2 receptor. A strong preference for the 5-HT1D alpha, over the 5-HT1D beta receptor was also apparent. An analog bearing a butylglutarimide side chain, S-7k, was extremely selective for the 5-HT1A receptor. Although this compound possessed a K-i of 0.6 nM, it elicited only modest changes in 5-HTP brain levels. However, this compound did not appear as an antagonist when tested in a cyclic-AMP-based intrinsic activity assay.
