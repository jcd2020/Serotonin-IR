	5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) serotonin receptors are important for a variety of functions including vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, and the modulation of perception, cognition, and emotion. In a search for 5-HT2A receptor-interacting proteins, we discovered that caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a scaffolding protein enriched in caveolae, complexes with 5-HT2A receptors in a number of cell types including C6 glioma cells, transfected HEK-293 cells, and rat brain synaptic membrane preparations. To address the functional significance of this interaction, we performed RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells, a cell type that endogenously expresses both 5-HT2A receptors and Cav-1. We discovered that the in vitro knockdown of Cav-1 in C6 glioma cells nearly abolished 5-HT2A receptor-mediated signal transduction as measured by calcium flux assays. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Cav-1 also greatly attenuated endogenous Galpha(q)-coupled P2Y purinergic receptor-mediated signaling without altering the signaling of PAR-1 thrombin receptors. Cav-1 appeared to modulate 5-HT2A signaling by facilitating the interaction of 5-HT2A receptors with Galpha(q). These studies provide compelling evidence for a prominent role of Cav-1 in regulating the functional activity of not only 5-HT2A serotonin receptors but also selected Galpha(q)-coupled receptors.
