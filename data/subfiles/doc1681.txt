Casanovas, J. M., et al. (1999). "Differential regulation of somatodendritic serotonin 5-HT1A receptors by 2-week treatments with the selective agonists alnespirone (S-20499) and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin: Microdialysis and autoradiographic studies in rat brain."

	Single treatment with the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and alnespirone (S-20499) reduces the extracellular 5-HT concentration (5-HText) in the rat midbrain and forebrain, Given the therapeutic potential of selective 5-HT1A agonists in the treatment of affective disorders, we have examined the changes in 5-HT1A receptors induced by 2-week minipump administration of alnespirone (0.3 and 3 mg/kg/day) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg/day). The treatment with alnespirone did not modify baseline 5-HText but significantly attenuated the ability of 0.3 mg/kg s.c. alnespirone to reduce 5-HText in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and frontal cortex. In contrast, the ability of 8-OH-DPAT (0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg s.c.) to reduce 5-HText in both areas was unchanged by 8-OH-DPAT pretreatment. Autoradiographic analysis revealed a significant reduction of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT and [H-3]WAY-100635 {H-3-labeled N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide . 3HCl} binding to somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors (but not to postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors) of rats pretreated with alnespirone but not with 8-OH-DPAT. In situ hybridization analysis revealed no change of the density of the mRNA encoding the 5-HT1A receptors in the DRN after either treatment. These data indicate that continuous treatment for 2 weeks with alnespirone, but not with 8-OH-DPAT, causes a functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptors controlling 5-HT release in the DRN and frontal cortex.
