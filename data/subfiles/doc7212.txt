McGrath, C. and T. R. Norman (1999). "(+)-S-20499 -- a potential antidepressant? A behavioural and neurochemical investigation in the olfactory bulbectomised rat." Eur Neuropsychopharmacol 9(1-2): 21-27.

	The study was designed to assess the potential antidepressant properties of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, (+)-S-20499 (10 mg kg(-1) i.p.) in the olfactory bulbectomised (OB) rat. Following 2 weeks of treatment, the rats were tested in the elevated plus maze and the "open field". A characteristic hyperactive response was evident in the OB animals in the "open field" which was reversed following chronic treatment with (+)-S-20499. In the elevated plus maze an increase in the number of open arm entries and the time spent on the open arms was observed, although this failed to reach significance. A significant decrease in beta1 receptor affinity was evident following olfactory bulbectomy which was normalised by (+)-S-20499. (+)-S-20499 also significantly reduced the density of 5-HT2 receptors in the sham operated (SO) animals. These studies demonstrate the usefulness of the OB rat as a screening test for compounds with novel putative mechanisms of action, and highlights the potential antidepressant properties of (+)-S-20499.
