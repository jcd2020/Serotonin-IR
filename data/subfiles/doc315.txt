	Molecular processes regulating the cerebellar serotonergic receptors play an important role in the control of respiration and cognitive functions under hypoxia. The present study examined cerebellar 5HT receptor alterations and neuroprotective effect of glucose supplementation prior to current sequence of resuscitation-oxygen and epinephrine supplementation in hypoxic neonatal rats. Hypoxic stress increased the number of total 5HT and 5HT(2A) receptors along with an up-regulation of 5HT transporter and 5HT(2A) receptor gene in cerebellum. These serotonergic alterations were reversed to near control by glucose supplementation. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed the data. Behavioral studies revealed the cognitive impairment due to neonatal hypoxia in the later stages of life and the role of timely glucose supplementation in preventing these behavioral deficits. The enhanced cerebellar 5HT(2A) receptors may act as a modulator of ventilatory response to hypoxia, which can in turn result in cognitive dysfunction. Glucose supplementation helped in managing the serotonergic functional alterations. This has immense clinical significance in neonatal care.
