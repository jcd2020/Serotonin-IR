	We examined the modulatory effect of serotonergic activities on haloperidol-induced up-regulation of dopamine D2 receptors in rat striatum. Chronic treatment with haloperidol (0.1, 0.5 mg/kg, i.p., 3 weeks) increased the number of dopamine D2 receptors, while no increase was observed with atypical antipsychotic drugs clozapine (10 mg/kg) and ORG 5222 (0.25 mg/kg). Chronic treatment with MK 212, a serotonin (5-HT)2A/2C receptor agonist (2.5 mg/kg), or with citalopram, a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (10 mg/kg), potentiated the haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg)-induced up-regulation of dopamine D2 receptor, while that with (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist (0.1 mg/kg), had no influence on the dopamine D2 receptor up-regulation. Co-administration of ritanserin (1 mg/kg), a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, with a low dose of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), but not with a high dose of the agent (0.5 mg/kg), attenuated the dopamine D2 receptor up-regulation. Drug occupation of 5-HT2A and dopamine D2 receptors in vivo examined with use of N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) was 69.8% and 45.1%, respectively, after the acute administration of haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg) plus ritanserin (1 mg/kg). This profile that 5-HT2A receptors were highly occupied compared with dopamine D2 receptors was similar to that of clozapine or ORG 5222. These results suggest that potent 5-HT2A receptor antagonism versus weak dopamine D2 receptor blockade may be involved in the absence of up-regulation of dopamine D2 receptors after chronic treatment with clozapine or ORG 5222.
