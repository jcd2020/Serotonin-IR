Schmitz, D., et al. (1995). "Serotonin and 8-OH-DPAT reduce excitatory transmission in rat hippocampal area CA1 via reduction in presumed presynaptic Ca2+ entry." Brain Res 701(1-2): 249-254.

	The effect of 5-HT and its 1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on excitatory transmission in CA1 pyramidal cells was studied. Using concentrations of 5-HT within a range of 10-50 microM we observed no change in excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 cells evoked by Schaffer collateral stimulation. However, at higher concentrations, > or = 100 microM, 5-HT caused a significant decrease (30-40%) in EPSP/Cs, an effect that was also mimicked by 50 microM 8-OH-DPAT. A presumed presynaptic Ca2+ entry was measured in stratum radiatum following repetitive stimulation of the Schaffer collaterals with all excitatory synaptic transmission blocked. Both 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT reduced this Ca2+ entry. These results suggest that 5-HT acts at presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors to reduce Ca2+ entry and thereby glutamatergic synaptic transmission.
