Pruus, K., et al. (2002). "1-(1-naphthyl)-piperazine, a mixed 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A/2C receptor ligand, elicits an anxiolytic-like effect in the open-field test without changes in 5-HT metabolism." Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol 24(3): 151-157.

	The effects of acute 1-(1-naphthyl)-piperazine (1-NP, 2 mg/kg i.p.) on rat open-field and social interaction behaviors were studied followed by postmortem and in vivo microdialysis measurement of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyidolacetic acid (5-HIAA) content. 1-NP treatment elicited an anxiolytic-like effect in the open-field test, which was not modified by citalopram (5 mg/kg i.p.) challenge. A statistically insignificant tendency toward prolongation of the social interaction time was also found. The only significant change in the postmortem experiment was found in the striatum: 5-HIAA content was reduced after combined 1-NP plus citalopram treatment. Using the in vivo microdialysis technique, no difference in the 5-HT or 5-HIAA output between the treatment groups was found in the frontal cortex of anaesthetized rats. Our present study demonstrates the anxiolytic-like properties of 1-NP in the open-field test, but this effect is irrelevant to changes in 5-HT metabolism.
