Majo, V. J., et al. (2008). "Synthesis and evaluation of O-methyl-C-11 4- 3- 4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazin-1-yl propoxyl-4-aza-t ricyclo 5.2.1.02,6 dec-8-ene-3,5-dione as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist PET ligand." J Labelled Comp Radiopharm 51(3-4): 132-136.

	4-[3-[4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]propoxy]-4-aza-tricyclo[5.2.1.02,6]dec-8-ene-3,5-dione (4), a potent and selective 5-HT1A agonist, was labeled by C-11-methylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue 3 with C-11-methyl triflate. The precursor molecule 3 was synthesized from commercially available endo-N-hydroxy-5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboximide in two steps with an overall yield of 40%. Radiosynthesis of C-11-4 was achieved in 35 min in 20 +/- 5% yield (n = 6) at the end of synthesis with a specific activity of 2600 +/- 250 Ci/mmol. In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) studies in baboon revealed rapid uptake of the tracer into the brain. However, lack of specific binding indicates that C-11-4 is not useful as a 5-HT1A agonist PET ligand for clinical studies.
