	A variety of alterations in brain neurotransmitter systems has been proposed as the cause of bipolar disorder (BD). We conducted a PUBMED search, which provided a total of 45 in vivo investigations with PET and SPECT, in which binding to serotonin transporter (SERT), 5-HT(1A) receptor (R), 5-HT(2A)R, dopamine transporter (DAT), vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2), D(1)R, D(2)R, muscarinic M2R and nicotinic ÃŸ2-nAChR as well as dopamine synthesis and/or dopamine release were assessed in BD patients in the manic (6 studies, 39 patients, 77 controls), depressive (15 studies, 248 patients, 488 controls) or eu- thymic condition (18 studies, 265 patients, 293 controls) and in mixed collectives of BD patients (6 studies, 55 patients, 80 controls). The retrospective analysis revealed a complex pattern of dysregulations within and between neurotransmitter systems, which is causally linked to the acute and euthymic states of BD. While increased mesencephalic, limbic and parietotemporoccipital serotonin and increased frontal dopamine underlie mania, the depressive state is characterized by decreased frontal and limbic serotonin, increased frontal and limbic acetylcholine and increased frontal dopamine. Also in euthymia, no normalization of receptor and transporter densities was observed. Alterations of regulation states of bindings sites, however, act together to achieve a normalization of mesencephalic, limbic and cortical serotonin.
