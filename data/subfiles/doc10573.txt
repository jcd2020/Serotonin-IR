Raiteri, M., et al. (1993). "INHIBITION BY 5-HT3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS OF RELEASE OF CHOLECYSTOKININ-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY FROM THE FRONTAL-CORTEX OF FREELY MOVING RATS." Naunyn-Schmiedebergs Archives of Pharmacology 347(1): 111-114.

	Effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, ondansetron and tropisetron, on the release of cholecystokinin-like immunoreactivity (CCK-LI) in rat frontal cortex were investigated in conscious, unrestrained rats using intracerebral microdialysis. The release of CCK-LI was augmented by perfusion with 100 mug/ml veratrine and was fully Ca2+-dependent and tetrodotoxin-sensitive. Ondansetron and tropisetron, each at 0.1 - 1 mumol/l, decreased concentration-dependently the veratrine-evoked efflux of CCK-LI. The reduction of CCK-LI output was approximately 30% when the antagonists were infused at 0.1 mumol/l. The data suggest that 5-HT3 receptor antagonists prevent the release of CCK evoked by endogenous 5-hydroxytryptamine. These drugs may thus represent a novel therapeutic approach in disease states, like anxiety, in which an inappropriately high release of brain CCK or 5-hydroxytryptamine seems to be involved.
