Barcelo, M., et al. (2007). "Synthesis and binding affinity of new pyrazole and isoxazole derivatives as potential atypical antipsychotics." Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 17(17): 4873-4877.

	We describe the synthesis and binding affinities on D-2, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors of 6-aminomethyl-6,7-dihydro-1 H-indazol -4(5 H) -ones and 6-aminomethyl- 6,7-dihyd to - 3 -methyl- benzo [d] i soxazol -4(5 H)- ones, as conformationally constrained butyropherione analogues. One of the new compounds showed good in vitro binding features, and a Meltzer's ratio characteristic of an atypical antipsychotic profile. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
