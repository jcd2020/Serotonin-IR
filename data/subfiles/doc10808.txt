	Introduction: We wanted to elucidate whether the proposed advantages of citalopram-buspirone combination treatment are related to changes in 5-HT2A/C receptor-mediated neurotransmission. Methods: The affinity of buspirone to 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors was measured in vitro, and the influence of buspirone on 5-HT2C receptor-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was estimated. Four groups of rats received citalopram (10 mg/kg), buspirone (6 mg/kg), citalopram-buspirone combination, or saline once a day s.c. for 14 days. Treatment effects on 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors were investigated by receptor autoradiography with antagonist and agonist radioligands. Results: Buspirone was found to be a weak 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, with a low affinity for 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Repeated buspirone-citaloprarn combination treatment markedly decreased [H-3]ketanserin and [I-125]DOI binding to 5-HT2A receptors. Repeated administration of buspirone and buspirone-citalopram combination increased the affinity of [H-3]mesulergine toward 5-HT2c receptors, and buspirone-citaloprarn combination also decreased [I-125]DOI binding to 5-HT2c receptors. Discussion: We suggest that down-regulation of brain 5-HT2A receptors and possibly of 5-HT2C receptor agonist sites is involved in the beneficial clinical effects of buspirone-SSRI augmentation treatment. Furthermore, a conversion of brain 5-HT2c receptors from high- to low-affinity state may provide an additional mechanism for the anti-anxiety effects of buspirone.
