	Agomelatine (S 20098) is a novel antidepressant drug with melatonin receptor agonist and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist properties, but actual mechanisms underlying its antidepressant action are unknown. Because functional desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) occurs after chronic administration of several classes of antidepressants, we investigated whether this adaptive change could also be induced by agomelatine. Neither acute nor chronic treatment with agomelatine (10 mg/kg i.p. for 14 days or 50 mg/kg i.p. for 21 days) changed the density of 5-HT1A receptors and their coupling with G proteins in the DRN and the hippocampus in rats. Moreover, these treatments did not affect the basal electrophysiological characteristics and the responses to 5-HT1A receptor stimulation of DRN and hippocampal neurons in brain slices. Parallel experiments with melatonin (10 mg/kg i.p. for 14 days) and fluoxetine (5 mg/kg i.p. for 14 days) as reference compounds showed that the former was unable to affect 5-HT1A receptors whereas the latter decreased both the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated [S-35]GTP-gamma-S binding and the potency of ipsapirone, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, to inhibit neuronal firing in the DRN. These data indicate that the antidepressant action of agomelatine is not mediated through the same mechanisms as SSRIs or tricyclics. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
