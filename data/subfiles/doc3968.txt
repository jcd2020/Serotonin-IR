	Abnormalities in the serotonergic signalling system, including the serotonin 1a receptor, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and bipolar 1 disorder. However, there is no consensus on whether the density of the serotonin 1a receptor and/or the activity of the G-proteins linking the receptor to the intracellular cascade are altered in these disease states. To address these issues, tissue obtained postmortem from four cortical regions was used to measure [3H] 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT) binding and 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTPgammaS) binding to determine if either parameter is altered in schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder. There was an effect of diagnosis on the level of [3H] 8-OH-DPAT binding that may indicate a global change in the density of serotonin 1a receptors, although this effect did not reach significance in any individual brain region. The activation of serotonin 1a receptors did not differ significantly with diagnoses. However, in the outer cortical layers, there appeared to be a dissociation between the number of receptors available and the extent of ligand-induced GTPgammaS binding, suggesting considerable receptor reserve. In addition, comparing gender independent of diagnoses, a decrease in the levels of serotonin 1a receptors was observed in the cortex of female subjects. These data indicates that there may be subtle changes in serotonin 1a receptors across the cortex in schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder and suggests a gender discordance in receptor levels.
