Morin, D., et al. (1992). "LABELING OF RAT-BRAIN BETA-ADRENOCEPTORS - (H-3)CGP-12177 OR (I-125)IODOCYANOPINDOLOL." J Recept Res 12(3): 369-387.

	Binding of (I-125)iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) and (H-3)CGP-12177 to rat brain homogenates was characterized and compared. ICYP was shown to bind to both beta-adrenergic and serotonin1B (5HT1B) receptors whereas (H-3)CGP-12177 only labelled the first ones. The addition of 10-mu-M serotonin (5HT) prevented ICYP binding to 5HT receptors and under these experimental conditions both ligands labelled a similar total number of beta-adrenoceptors in the different rat brain regions. ICYP displayed a higher affinity for cerebellar (mainly beta-2-subtype) than for cerebral cortex beta-adrenoceptors (mainly beta-1-subtype) suggesting a subtype selectivity. A multiple displacement binding approach using CGP-20712A, a beta-1-subtype ligand, as competitor revealed a 2.6 fold selectivity of ICYP for the beta-2-adrenoceptor subtype. On the other hand, (H-3)CGP-12177 binds only to beta-adrenoceptors and is not subtype selective in the rat brain homogenate. Considering both its high specificity and its lack of subtype selectivity (H-3)CGP-12177 seems to be a more suitable ligand than ICYP to non-selectively label beta-adrenoceptors in rat brain.
