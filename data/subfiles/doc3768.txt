Fiorino, F., et al. (2009). "Synthesis and in vitro pharmacological evaluation of a new series of 5-HT1A 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor ligands containing a norbornene nucleus." Pharmazie 64(9): 555-564.

	A series of 4-substituted piperazine derivatives bearing a norbornene nucleus have been prepared and their affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors has been evaluated. Compounds showing the highest affinity have been selected and evaluated on dopaminergic (D-1 and D-2) and adrenergic (alpha(1) and alpha(2)) receptors. The combination of structural elements (heterocyclic nucleus, oxyalkyl chain and 4-substituted piperazine) known to be critical in order to have affinity on serotonin receptors and the proper selection of substituents led to compounds with higher receptor specificity and affinity. In binding studies, several molecules showed affinity in nanomolar range towards 5-HT1A, 5HT(2A) and 5-HT2C receptors and moderate to no affinity for other relevant receptors (D-1, D-2, alpha(1) and alpha(2)). Compound 2q 4-[2-[4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethoxy]-4-aza-tricyclo[5.2.1.02,6]dec-8-ene-3,5-dione (K-i = 1.13 nM), was the most active and selective derivative for the 5-HT2C receptor with respect to other serotonin, cloparninergic and adrenergic receptors. Moreover, compound 3p showed mixed 5HT(2A)/5-HT2C activity with affinity values in nanomolar range.
