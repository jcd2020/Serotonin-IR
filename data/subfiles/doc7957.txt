Marchetti, E., et al. (2004). "Modulation of memory processes and cellular excitability in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats by a 5-HT4 receptors partial agonist, and an antagonist." Neuropharmacology 47(7): 1021-1035.

	Firstly, olfactory association learning was used to determine the modulating effect of 5-HT4 receptor involvement in learning and long-term memory. Secondly, the effects of systemic injections of a 5-HT4 partial agonist and an antagonist on long-term potentiation (LTP) and depotentiation in the dentate gyrus (DG) were tested in freely moving rats. The modulating role of the 5-HT4 receptors was studied by using a potent, 5-HT4 partial agonist RS 67333 [1-(4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)-3-(1-n-butyl-4-piperidinyl)-1-propanone] and a selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS 67532 [1-(4-amino-5-chloro-2-(3,5-dimethoxybenzyloxyphenyl)-5-(1-piperidinyl)-1-propano ne]. Agonist or antagonist systemic chronic injections prior to five training sessions yielded a facilitatory effect on procedural memory during the first session only with the antagonist. Systemic injection of the antagonist only before the first training session improved procedural memory during the first session and associative memory during the second session. Similar injection with the 5-HT4 partial agonist had an opposite effect. The systemic injection of the 5-HT4 partial agonist prior to the induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus by high-frequency stimulation was followed by a population spike increase, while the systemic injection of the antagonist accelerated the depotentiation 48 h later. The behavioural and physiological results pointed out the involvement of 5-HT4 receptors in processing related to the long-term hippocampal-dependent memory system, and suggest that specific 5-HT4 agonists could be used to treat amnesic patients with a dysfunction in this particular system.
