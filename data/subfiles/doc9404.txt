	Hamsters repeatedly exposed to cocaine during adolescence display high levels of offensive aggression compared to saline-treated littermates. The escalated offensive phenotype observed in adolescent cocaine-treated animals is modulated by serotonin (5-HT) signaling and can be suppressed by inhibiting 5-HT type 3 receptors, suggesting that these receptors might play an important role in the aggression-stimulating effects of adolescent cocaine exposure. The current study examined this hypothesis and extended earlier studies investigating the relationship between 5HT(3) receptor neural signaling and the offensive response patterns of aggressive, adolescent cocaine-treated animals compared to non-aggressive, saline-treated littermates. Adolescent cocaine-treated hamsters and saline-treated littermates were tested for offensive aggression after the administration of either the 5-HT(3) antagonist 3-tropanylindole-3-carboxylate methiodide (tropisetron) or the 5-HT(3) agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide hydrochloride (mCPBG). Tropisetron significantly reduced the high levels of offensive responding observed in adolescent cocaine-treated animals, whereas treatment with the 5-HT(3) receptor agonist mCPBG failed to affect the escalated offensive response. Conversely, tropisetron failed to affect very low, baseline levels of aggressive responding seen in adolescent saline-treated animals, while 5-HT(3) receptor activation via mCPBG triggered highly escalated levels of offensive aggression in these animals. Together, these data support a stimulatory role for 5-HT(3) neural signaling in offensive aggression. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
