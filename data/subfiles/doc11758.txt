	The serotonergic system plays a key role in regulating basic behaviors. Deficits in serotonergic neurotransmission have been implicated in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and depression. Here we have optimized a behavioral screen and performed a small scale genetic screen to identify genes involved in serotonin responsiveness in the mouse. Treatment of mice with serotonin, serotonin precursors, or serotonin agonists results in a quantifiable head twitch response (HTR), which is drug dosage-dependent and dependent on the 5-HT2A receptor system. This assay can uncover variation in serotonin responsiveness as shown by our identification of inbred strains with high, medium, and low head twitch responses to administration of the serotonin agonist DOI (+-1-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane). We chose C57Bl/6J mice for our mutagenesis screen, because of their robust HTR and because of the availability of their complete genomic sequence. We optimized this assay by examining dose and age dependence of DOI-induced HTR in 6-week and 3-month-old C57BL/6J mice. HTR decreases only slightly in 3-month-old mice, and a substantial but submaximal HTR is induced by 0.75-1 mg/kg of DOI. We assayed HTR in response to DOI of 247 G1 C57BL/6J progeny from C57BL/6J males, which had been mutagenized with ethylnitrososurea (ENU), and recovered one provisionally heritable hyper-responsive mutation. This and future mutations recovered via this protocol may provide ideal subjects for the study of human psychiatric disorders, such as depression and schizophrenia, and thereby aid in the development of better therapeutic strategies for these disorders. Thus, it is well worth expanding on this genetic screen in its current form and by addition of further pharmacologic assays in the future.
