Nakamura, M. and T. Nagamine (2019). "Brexpiprazole as a New Serotonin-Dopamine Receptor Modulator: Considering the Clinical Relevance for Metabolic Parameters and Prolactin Levels." Innov Clin Neurosci 16(9-10): 30-32.

	Atypical antipsychotics, used to treat patients with schizophrenia, focus on dopamine-2 (D(2)) plus serotonin-2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor antagonism and currently carry different degrees of certain adverse effects. Brexpiprazole is a new serotonin-dopamine receptor modulator that acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT(1A) and D(2) receptors. In patients who were either introduced to brexpiprazole because of nonadherence to traditional medications or were switched from apripiprazole, olanzapine, or paliperidone, the impact of brexpiprazole on different parameters was evaluated. Ultimately, it was found that brexpiprazol treatment displayed a low propensity to influence metabolic parameters (lipids and glucose) and minimal impact on prolactin levels. Further prospective and longer follow-up studies involving larger groups of subjects are required.
