	Functional serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors have been divided into three subtypes: 5-HT1-like, 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 (ref. 1). Brain binding sites have been identified for both the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 subtypes. Receptors of the 5-HT3 type have been characterized on isolated peripheral tissue models such as the rat vagus nerve, guinea-pig ileum and isolated rabbit heart. Using these models, selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists such as MDL 72222 (ref. 5), ICS 205-930 (ref. 6), GR38032F (ref. 7) and BRL 43694 (ref. 8) have been developed. Recently, GR38032F, MDL 72222 and ICS 205-930 have been shown to have behavioural effects in rodents and primates that undoubtedly reflect an action in the central nervous system (refs 9-11 and unpublished observations), suggesting the existence of 5-HT3 receptors in the brain. Here we report direct evidence for the existence of 5-HT3 receptors in rat brain tissue and their distribution, based on high affinity binding of the potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist 3H-GR65630 to homogenates of rat entorhinal cortex. Selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and agonists inhibited binding of 3H-GR65630 with high affinities which correlated well with their actions on the rat isolated vagus nerve. Binding was differentially distributed throughout the brain with high concentrations in cortical and limbic areas.
