Stenfors, C. and S. B. Ross (2002). "Evidence for involvement of 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) autoreceptors in the enhancement of serotonin turnover in the mouse brain following repeated treatment with fluoxetine." Life Sci 71(24): 2867-2880.

	The effect of repeated treatment with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine on synthesis and turnover of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was studied in the mouse brain in vivo. The concentration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and 5-HT was measured in hypothalamus, hippocampus and frontal cortex after inhibition of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity with m-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD 1015). Fluoxetine 6.9 mg/kg s.c. was injected once daily for three weeks. Three days after the final daily injection of fluoxetine 5-HT synthesis (5-HTP accumulation) and turnover (5-HIAA/5-HT ratio) were significantly enhanced compared with saline-treated mice. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was already significantly elevated after 3 days of fluoxetine treatment and continued to increase during treatment for 2-3 weeks. The increase in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was considerably larger (150-200% of controls) than the increase in 5-HTP accumulation (110-120%), which reached significance only after 3 weeks of treatment. The increase in 5-HT synthesis may be secondary to that of the turnover. The 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio returned to control values after a 14 days washout period. Simultaneous treatment with the long-acting 5-HT(1B)-receptor antagonist, SB 224289 for 14 days counteracted the fluoxetine-induced increase in 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio that indicates involvement of 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors in the development of this increase. It is proposed that the fluoxetine-induced enhancement of 5-HT turnover was evoked by the long-lasting stimulation of 5-HT(1B) autoreceptors that resulted in an intraneuronal compensatory adaptation of the basal 5-HT release.
