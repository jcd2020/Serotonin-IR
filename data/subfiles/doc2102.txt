Chen, A., et al. (2017). "Serotonin 5-HT4 receptors modulate the development of glutamatergic input to the dorsal raphe nucleus." Neurosci Lett 640: 111-116.

	The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is a major serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)-producing region in the central nervous system. It receives glutamatergic inputs from several brain regions, which are reciprocally modulated by serotonergic signals. We investigated whether serotonin 5-HT4 receptors (5-HT4Rs) play a role in the development of glutamatergic control of the DRN, with an emphasis on cortical inputs. Double-label immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used to quantify vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGluT1)-immunoreactive terminals in the DRN of mice with a null-mutation in the 5-HT4R gene. We found no significant change in the overall density of vGluT1-positive terminals in homozygous and heterozygous mice, but heterozygous mice had a significantly higher density of vGluT1-positive terminals contacting serotonergic neurons. These results suggest that altered 5-HT4R expression may affect the development of cortical glutamatergic control of the DRN.
