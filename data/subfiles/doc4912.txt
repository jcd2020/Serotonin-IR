Hamblin, M. W. and M. A. Metcalf (1991). "PRIMARY STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION OF A HUMAN 5-HT1D-TYPE SEROTONIN RECEPTOR." Mol Pharmacol 40(2): 143-148.

	We describe the nucleic acid sequence encoding a human 5-hydroxytryptamine1D (5-HT1D) serotonin receptor and some of the functional characteristics of the gene product. The receptor gene was isolated by hybridization to a probe based on a canine thyroid cDNA (called RDC4) previously isolated by others and believed to encode a heretofore undetermined member of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-linked receptor family. The human clone we isolated, called MA6A, contains an apparently intronless open reading frame encoding a 377-amino acid polypeptide with the seven hydrophobic domains characteristic of G protein-linked receptors. The MA6A deduced amino acid sequence is 88% identical to that for RDC4 and 43% identical to that for the human 5-HT1A receptor. Expression of the human gene product in transfected cell lines results in the appearance of saturable high affinity 5-HT1D-type [H-3]5-HT binding. The expressed receptor exhibits features indicative of coupling to G(i) proteins, i.e., robust inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation and formation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive high agonist affinity binding state. These findings may help clarify several ambiguities in the classification and action of serotonin receptor subtypes.
