Matsuda, T., et al. (1989). "Agonist activity of a novel compound, 1-[3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenoxy)propyl]-4-phenyl piperazine (BP-554), at central 5-HT1A receptors." Eur J Pharmacol 170(1-2): 75-82.

	We used an in vitro radioligand receptor binding assay with rat cerebral cortex, hippocampus and striatum membrane preparations to show that 1-[3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenoxy)propyl]-4-phenyl piperazine (BP-554) had much higher affinity for 5-HT1A recognition sites than for 5-HT1-non-A, 5-HT2, benzodiazepine, dopamine D-2 and alpha 2-adrenergic recognition sites. The compound inhibited the activity of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in rat hippocampal membranes. Intraperitoneal injection of BP-554 to mice decreased the concentration of only 5-hydroxy-indoleacetic acid of the amines and their metabolites in the brain and decreased the accumulation of 5-hydroxytryptophan in the brain after decarboxylase inhibition by 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine. Furthermore, the administration of BP-554 caused hypothermia and increased serum corticosterone levels in mice. The observed effects of BP-554 were similar to those of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. These results suggest that BP-554 acts as a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist in vivo.
