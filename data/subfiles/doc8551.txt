Pandey, S. C., et al. (1992). "EFFECT OF ETHANOL ADMINISTRATION AND WITHDRAWAL ON SEROTONIN RECEPTOR SUBTYPES AND RECEPTOR-MEDIATED PHOSPHOINOSITIDE HYDROLYSIS IN RAT-BRAIN." Alcoholism-Clinical and Experimental Research 16(6): 1110-1116.

	The effect of short-term (15 days) and long-term (60 days) ethanol treatment and withdrawal on agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis, serotonin receptor subtypes (5HT1A and 5HT2), and alpha1-adrenergic receptors were studied in rat cerebral cortex. Short term ethanol treatment had no significant effect on serotonin (5HT) norepinephrine (NE), and calcium ionophore (A23187)-stimulated [H-3]-inositol-1-phosphate ([H-3]-IP1) formation and 5-HT2 receptors as measured by I-125-lysergic acid diethylamide (I-125-LSD) binding, in rat cerebral cortex. However, 15 days of ethanol treatment, followed by 24 hr of withdrawal resulted in a decrease in B(max) of I-125-LSD binding without significant change in K(D), as well as a decrease in 5HT-stimulated [H-3]-IP1 formation in rat cerebral cortex. 5HT1A and alpha1-adrenergic receptors were determined by using [H-3]-8-hydroxy- 2. (di-N-propylamino)tetralin and [H-3]-prazosin as radioligand, respectively. We also observed that long-term ethanol treatment had no significant effect on B(max) and K(D) of 5HT2, 5HT1A, and alpha1-adrenergic receptors, as well as NE and A23187-stimulated [H-3]-IP1 formation, but significantly decreased the 5HT-stimulated [H-3]-IP1 formation in rat cerebral cortex. It is possible that a decrease in 5HT-induced PI turnover after long-term ethanol exposure may be due to a decrease in coupling of 5HT2 receptors to G protein or PLC enzyme, whereas the decrease in 5HT-induced PI turnover after withdrawal may be due to a decrease in functional 5HT2 receptor number.
