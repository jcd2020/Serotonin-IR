Prabhakaran, J., et al. (2006). "Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of O-methyl-C-11 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-methylbenzyl)-N-(1-methyl-piperidin-4-yl)acetam ide as as imaging probe for 5-HT2A receptors." Journal of Labelled Compounds & Radiopharmaceuticals 49(12): 1069-1077.

	2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-N-(4-methylbenzyl)-N-(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)acetamide (AC90179, 4), a highly potent and selective competitive 5-HT2A antagonist, was labeled by [C-11]methylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue 5 with [C-11]methyl triflate. The precursor molecule 5 for radiolabeling was synthesized from p-tolylmethylamine in three steps with 46% overall yield. [C-11]AC90179 was synthesized in 30 min (30 +/- 5% yield, EOS) with a specific activity of 4500 +/- 500 Ci/mmol and > 99% chemical and radiochemical purities. Positron emission tomography studies in anesthetized baboon revealed that [C-11]4 Penetrates the blood brain barrier (BBB) with a rapid influx and efflux of the tracer in all brain regions. Due to lack of tracer retention or specific binding, [C-11]4 cannot be used as PET ligand for imaging 5-HT2A receptors. (c) Copyright 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
