Wirtshafter, D. and K. E. Asin (1995). "Dopamine antagonists induce fos-like-immunoreactivity in the substantia nigra and entopeduncular nucleus of the rat." Brain Res 670(2): 205-214.

	Injections of the D2 receptor antagonists haloperidol (0.5-8 mg/kg) and metoclopramide (6.25-50 mg/kg) in rats resulted in a dose dependent induction of Fos-like-immunoreactivity in the rostral portion of the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) and in the medial portion of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNpr). Nigral staining occurred exclusively in neurons which were not immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase and could be antagonized by pretreatment with the anticholinergic drug scopolamine (3 mg/kg). Effects were much less pronounced following injections of the selective D1 antagonist SCH-23390 (2-8 mg/kg). No staining could be observed following administration of the 5HT3 antagonist MDL-72222 (10 mg/kg) or the 5HT1/5HT2 antagonist metergoline (5 mg/kg), suggesting that the effects observed with dopamine antagonists were not secondary to actions at serotonin receptors. These results are consistant with the hypothesis that blockade of dopamine receptors results in a disinhibition of cells within the SNpr and EPN and further suggest that examination of immediate-early gene expression may provide a useful tool for studying the extrastriatal circuit engaged by manipulations of dopaminergic transmission.
