	The presence of serotonin (5-HT) in the chicken gastrointestinal tract has been previously reported, but its motor effects have been poorly described. The aims of this work were: A) to define the effects of 5-HT on chicken longitudinal ileum; B) to explore the mechanisms by which such effects occur and C) to identify the subtype(s) of 5-HT-ergic receptors implicated. The motor responses to 5-HT were assayed in vitro using ileal strips taken from male White Leghorn chickens 7-9 week old. 5-HT elicited ileal contraction (EC50 9.6 x 10(-8) M), which was markedly decreased in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). Repeated exposure of the tissue to supramaximal concentrations of 5-HT did not however lead to desensitization. Atropine (10(-6)M), ketanserin (10(-5) M), methysergide (10(-5) M) and methiothepine (10(-6) M) attenuated the response to 5-HT. Ketanserin was an effective inhibitor of the residual response to 5-HT obtained even in the presence of TTX. Several serotonergic agonists were assayed to further analyse the type of receptors involved in the response to 5-HT. 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MOT), a mixed 5-HT1, 5-HT2 and 5-HT4 agonist, reproduced all the effects of 5-HT. 8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1A agonist, trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine, a mixed 5-HT1B/C agonist, and m-chlorophenylbiguanide, a 5-HT3 agonist, did not induce any consistent contractile effects. Sumatriptan, a 5-HT1D agonist, exerted a slight agonistic effect which was blocked by methiothepine and decreased by TTX but not by atropine. Cisapride, a 5-HT4 partial agonist in mammals, decreased the effects of both 5-HT and 5-MOT. These results indicate that chicken ileum contains 5-HT1 receptors similar to the 5-HT1D mammalian subtype but not the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1C or 5-HT3 subtypes. 5-HT2 receptors are also present and would appear to be located on smooth muscle.
