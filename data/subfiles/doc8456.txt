Orsetti, M., et al. (2003). "Acquisition, retention, and recall of memory after injection of RS67333, a 5-HT4 receptor agonist, into the nucleus basalis magnocellularis of the rat." Learning & Memory 10(5): 420-426.

	The serotonin S-HT4 subtype receptor is predominantly localized into anatomical structures linked to memory and cognition. A few experimental studies report that the acute systemic administration of selective S-HT4 agonists has ameliorative effects on memory performance, and that these effects are reversed by contemporary administration of S-HT4 receptor antagonists. To verify whether this procognitive action occurs via the activation of the cholinergic nucleus basalis magnocellularls (NBM)-cortical pathways, we examined the effects of RS67333, a selective partial agonist of the S-HT4 receptor, on rat performance in a place recognition task upon local administration of the drug into the NBM area. The intra-NBM administration of RS67333 enhances the acquisition (200-500 ng/0.5 muL) and the consolidation (40-200 ng/0.5 muL) of the place recognition memory. These effects are reversed by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist RS39604 (300 ng/0.5 muL). Conversely, the recall of memory is not affected by the 5-HT4 agonist. Our results indicate that S-HT4 receptors located within the NBM may play a role in spatial memory and that the procognitive effect of RS67333 is due, at least in part, to the potentiation of the activity of cholinergic NBM-cortical pathways.
