Burnet, P. W., et al. (1996). "Hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor binding site densities, 5-HT1A receptor messenger ribonucleic acid abundance and serotonin levels parallel the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis in rats." Behav Brain Res 73(1-2): 365-368.

	We have previously demonstrated that susceptibility of the Lewis rat to inflammatory disease, compared to the relatively resistant Fischer F344 rat, is related to a hyporesponsive hypothalamopituitary adrenal axis to inflammatory and other stress mediators. Since 5-HT and the 5HT1A receptor are important stimulators of this axis, we have investigated the levels of 5-HT1A receptor binding sites and encoding mRNA, 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid in various brain regions of Lewis, Harlan Sprague Dawley and Fischer F344 rats. Lewis rats expressed significantly less hippocampal and frontal cortical 5-HT1A receptor binding sites and mRNA than Harlan Sprague-Dawley and Fischer F344 rats. Adrenalectomy increased the number of 5HT1A receptor binding sites and mRNA expression in the hippocampus of all three strains. The levels of hippocampal 5-HT in Fischer F344 rats were significantly greater than levels detected in the same regions for the other two strains. Hypothalamic 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid levels in Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were higher than the same area from the other two strains. Adrenalectomy increased the levels of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid in the hypothalamus of all three strains. We conclude that hippocampal 5-HT1A receptor densities and 5-HT levels in the rat parallel the the activity and responsiveness of the hypthalamopituitary-adrenal axis. We have published these data in an earlier report.
