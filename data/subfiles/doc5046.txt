	Serotonin 4 (5-HT4) receptor signaling does not only have the physiological function of improving cognition, but might also be helpful in the therapy of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through regulation of the production of soluble amyloid-beta protein precursor alpha (sAbetaPPalpha). To analyze the relationship between 5-HT4 receptor signaling and sAbetaPPalpha production, we stably transfected H4 cells with AbetaPP and 5-HT4 receptor (H4/AbetaPP/5-HT4 cells). We found that 24-h incubation with the 5-HT4 receptor agonist RS-67333 upregulates matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Furthermore, MMP-9 overexpression enhanced sAbetaPPalpha levels, whereas knockdown with MMP-9 siRNA decreased sAbetaPPalpha levels. When RS-67333 was injected for 10 days in Tg2576 mice, a model of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) deposition, there was an increase in hippocampal levels of sAbetaPPalpha, C-terminal fragment alpha, and MMP-9, as well as a decrease in hippocampal senile plaque number and levels of the 40 amino acid peptide, Abeta40. Taken all together, these experiments demonstrate that 5-HT4 receptor stimulation induces expression of MMP-9 which cleaves AbetaPP through alpha-secretase-like activity, leading to an increase of sAbetaPPalpha levels and a reduction of Abeta load.
