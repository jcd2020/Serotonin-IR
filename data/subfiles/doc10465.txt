Sokoloff, P. (2005). Molecular Effects of Antidepressant Treatments.

	Antidepressant drugs mainly target plasma membrane transporters for mono-amines with various selectivities for serotonin, noradrenaline and dopamine, and inhibit reuptake of these amines after their release, thus increasing their extracellular levels. In addition, antidepressant drugs share the property of being able to block the serotonin-gated cation channel (5-HT3 receptor). Drugs targeting receptors for substance P or corticotrophin-releasing factor have also been proposed as antidepressants. Chronic treatments with antidepressants induce changes in the activity of serotonin and dopamine neurons, notably by desensitizing inhibitory autoreceptors. After chronic antidepressant treatment, all these primary interactions seem to result in convergent adaptive changes mediated through the cyclic AMP/CREB/BDNF cascade. These changes are responsible for enhancement of the responsiveness to the mesolimbic dopamine system mediating motivation and reward, and for an increase of neurogenesis in the hippocampus, which is involved in the control of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis mediating stress responses. This rather coherent chain of events accounts for most of the observations made in animals receiving chronic antidepressant treatments, and has received some, as yet limited, support from clinical studies.
