	Cholinergic neurons of the mesopontine nuclei are strongly implicated in behavioral state regulation. One population of neurons in the cholinergic zone of the laterodorsal tegmentum and the pedunculopontine nuclei, referred to as rapid eye movement (REM)-on neurons, shows preferential discharge activity during REM sleep, and extensive data indicate a key role in production of this state. Another neuronal group present in the same cholinergic zone of the laterodorsal tegmentum and the pedunculopontine nuclei, referred to as Wake/REM-on neurons, shows preferential discharge activity during both wakefulness and REM sleep and is implicated in the production of electroencephalographic activation in both of these states. To test the hypothesis of differential serotonergic inhibition as an explanation of the different state-related discharge activity, we developed a novel methodology that enabled, in freely behaving animals, simultaneous unit recording and local perfusion of neuropharmacological agents using a microdialysis probe adjacent to the recording electrodes. Discharge activity of REM-on neurons was almost completely suppressed by local microdialysis perfusion of the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), although this agonist had minimal or no effect on the Wake/REM-on neurons. We conclude that selective serotonergic inhibition is a basis of differential state regulation in the mesopontine cholinergic nuclei, and that the novel methodology combining neurophysiological and neuropharmacological information from the freely behaving animal shows great promise for further insight into the neural basis of behavioral control.
