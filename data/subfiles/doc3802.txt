Fletcher, P. J., et al. (2002). "Activation of 5-HT(1B) receptors in the nucleus accumbens reduces self-administration of amphetamine on a progressive ratio schedule." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 71(4): 717-725.

	Brain serotonin interacts with dopamine function in a complex fashion. Previous work from our laboratory showed that activation of 5-HT(1B) receptors within the nucleus accumbens attenuates the ability of amphetamine to increase responding for conditioned reinforcement. The primary purpose of these experiments was to determine the impact of 5-HT receptor stimulation, with particular focus on 5-HT(1B) receptors in the nucleus accumbens on the reinforcing effect of amphetamine. To this end several experiments determined the effects of injecting 5-HT, and various 5-HT agonists, into the nucleus accumbens on responding for intravenous infusions of amphetamine (60 microg/kg) delivered according to a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement. Both 5-HT (2.5, 5 and 10 microg) and the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist CP93,129 (0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 microg) dose-dependently reduced responding for amphetamine. Injections of 5-HT but not CP93,129 also reduced responding for food under a similar PR schedule. The 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-OH-DPAT (5 microg) and the nonselective 5-HT(2) agonist DOI (10 microg) failed to alter amphetamine self-administration. Pretreatment with the selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist GR127935 (3 mg/kg) attenuated the ability of 5-HT and CP93,129 to reduce amphetamine self-administration following their injection into the nucleus accumbens. These results extend our previous findings that increasing 5-HT activity in the nucleus accumbens inhibits dopamine-dependent behaviour, and further indicate that activation of 5-HT(1B) receptors is particularly important in this regard.
