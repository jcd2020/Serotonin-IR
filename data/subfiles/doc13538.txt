Wilson, A. A., et al. (1998). "Derivatives of WAY 100635 as potential imaging agents for 5-HT1A receptors: syntheses, radiosyntheses, and in vitro and in vivo evaluation." Nucl Med Biol 25(8): 769-776.

	Analogues of the potent and selective 5-HT1A ligand, WAY 100635, were synthesized and examined as potential candidates for imaging 5-HT1A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET). Several of the analogues displayed nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor, comparable to WAY 100635. Three of these were examined in a model of human liver metabolism vis-a-vis WAY 100635. All showed a markedly lower propensity for amide hydrolysis than WAY 100635. Radiolabelling of these three potential PET radiotracers with carbon-11 was readily achieved from [11C]-iodomethane, and the newly synthesized radioligands were tested in vivo in rats for binding to 5-HT1A receptors. Whereas two of the ligands failed to bind to 5-HT1A receptors in vivo, one was successful. The latter, [11C]-7 [4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-[N-(2'-pyridinyl)-2-bicyclo[2.2.2]octanec arboxamido]ethyl]-piperazine], showed good brain penetration, hippocampal:cerebellar ratios of 10:1 at 45 min postinjection. Blocking studies with a variety of drugs demonstrated that the binding of [11C]-7 in vivo was selective for 5-HT1A receptors. [11C]-7 is a promising candidate as a ligand for imaging 5-HT1A receptors by PET.
