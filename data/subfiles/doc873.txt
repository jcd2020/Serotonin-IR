	RATIONALE: Accumulating evidence shows that the serotonergic system plays a major role in psychostimulant abuse through its interactions with the dopaminergic system. Studies indicate that serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptors are one of the main classes of receptors involved in mediating the influence of serotonin in drug abuse. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of the selective serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist WAY163909 on the behavioral neuropharmacology of cocaine and methamphetamine in adult rhesus macaques. METHODS: Cocaine or methamphetamine self-administration and reinstatement were evaluated under second-order and fixed-ratio schedules of reinforcement, respectively. Cocaine- and methamphetamine-induced increases in dopamine were assessed through in vivo microdialysis targeting the nucleus accumbens. RESULTS: Pretreatment with WAY163909 dose-dependently attenuated cocaine and methamphetamine self-administration and drug-induced reinstatement of extinguished behavior previously maintained by cocaine or methamphetamine delivery. In an additional experiment, WAY163909 induced a dose-dependent attenuation of cocaine- or methamphetamine-induced dopamine overflow in the nucleus accumbens. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that selective 5-HT(2C) receptor activation decreases drug intake and drug-seeking behavior in nonhuman primate models of psychostimulant abuse through neurochemical mechanisms involved in the modulation of mesolimbic dopamine.
