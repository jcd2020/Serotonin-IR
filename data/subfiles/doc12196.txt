	The serotonin system and NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) are both critically involved in the regulation of cognition and emotion under normal and pathological conditions; however, the interactions between them are essentially unknown. Here we show that serotonin, by activating 5-HT(1A) receptors, inhibited NMDA receptor-mediated ionic and synaptic currents in PFC pyramidal neurons, and the NR2B subunit-containing NMDA receptor is the primary target of 5-HT(1A) receptors. This effect of 5-HT(1A) receptors was blocked by agents that interfere with microtubule assembly, as well as by cellular knock-down of the kinesin motor protein KIF17 (kinesin superfamily member 17), which transports NR2B-containing vesicles along microtubule in neuronal dendrites. Inhibition of either CaMKII (calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II) or MEK/ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase) abolished the 5-HT(1A) modulation of NMDAR currents. Biochemical evidence also indicates that 5-HT(1A) activation reduced microtubule stability, which was abolished by CaMKII or MEK inhibitors. Moreover, immunocytochemical studies show that 5-HT(1A) activation decreased the number of surface NR2B subunits on dendrites, which was prevented by the microtubule stabilizer. Together, these results suggest that serotonin suppresses NMDAR function through a mechanism dependent on microtubule/kinesin-based dendritic transport of NMDA receptors that is regulated by CaMKII and ERK signaling pathways. The 5-HT(1A)-NMDAR interaction provides a potential mechanism underlying the role of serotonin in controlling emotional and cognitive processes subserved by PFC.
