Markowitz, J. S., et al. (2009). "The psychostimulant d-threo-(R,R)-methylphenidate binds as an agonist to the 5HT(1A) receptor." Pharmazie 64(2): 123-125.

	The present study was undertaken to determine whether d-threo-(R,R)-methylphenidate (MPH) was exerting binding activity as an agonist or antagonist of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors. [S-35]guanosine5'[gamma-thio]triphosphate ([S-35]GTP gamma S) binding assay and field-stimulated Guinea pig ileum assay were used to determine 5-HT1A receptor agonism and antagonism activity of d-threo(R,R)-MPH. The results suggested d-threo-(R,R)-MPH induced 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity at 100 mu m. The Guinea pig ileum functional assay showed that d-threo-(R,R)-MPH produced agonist-like reduction of neurogenic twitch with an EC50 5.65 +/- 0.36 mu M. At 30 mu M concentrations, d-threo-(R,R)MPH produced 171 +/- 4.24% of the relaxation relative to that caused by 0.12 mu M 8-OH-DPAT. However, d-threo-(R,R)-MPH exhibited no significant pharmacological activity in rat stomach fundus 5-HT2B receptor functional assay. Thus, d-threo-(R,R)-MPH appears to act as a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist in vitro. It is speculated that the activation of 5-HT1A receptor might play a partial role in d-threo-(R,R)-MPH mediated dopamine (DA) release in the brain.
