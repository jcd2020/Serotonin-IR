Pugliese, A. M., et al. (1998). "Effect of the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 on the inhibition of e.p.s.ps produced by 5-HT in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices." Br J Pharmacol 124(1): 93-100.

	1. The actions of N-(2-(-4(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide (WAY 100635), a novel and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) antagonist, on excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.p.s.ps) were investigated by use of intracellular recordings in pyramidal cells of the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices. 2. WAY 100635 (10 nM) did not affect any of the investigated parameters of cell excitability such as membrane potential, total input resistance (Rin), firing threshold, action potential amplitude, action potential frequency adaptation, and slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) which follows repetitive firing of action potentials. WAY 100635 did not have any effect on either the slope or the amplitude of e.p.s.ps evoked by stimulation of the CA1 stratum radiatum. 3. Bath application of either 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 10-30 microM) or 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT, 300 nM) hyperpolarized the membrane potential (deltaVm = -4.1 +/- 0.9 and -6.0 +/- 0.9 mV, respectively), and reduced Rin (-25 +/- 8% and -18 +/- 1%, respectively). 5-HT blocked the action potential frequency adaptation and significantly reduced the amplitude of the sAHP that follows repetitive firing of action potentials. 4. 5-HT significantly decreased the amplitude of evoked e.p.s.ps (-14 +/- 6%). This effect was greater in the presence of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline (10 microM, -45 +/- 12%) and was mimicked by 5-CT (-49 +/- 5%). Both AMPA and NMDA components of e.p.s.ps were significantly reduced in amplitude by 5-HT (-38 +/- 8%, n = 6, and -29 +/- 12%, n = 3, respectively; P < 0.05). 5. WAY 100635 fully antagonized the hyperpolarization, the reduction of Rin, and the decrease in amplitude of e.p.s.ps elicited by 5-HT, while it did not affect the action of 5-HT on the action potential frequency adaptation. In the presence of WAY 100635, 5-HT elicited a depolarization which was blocked by 10-30 microM RS 23597-190, a selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist. 6. Our data demonstrate that WAY 100635 is devoid of direct effects on CA1 pyramidal cell excitability and on evoked e.p.s.ps, while it fully antagonizes the effects of 5-HT on excitatory synaptic transmission and on hyperpolarization, without affecting the 5-HT4 receptor-mediated response. Since WAY 100635 selectively antagonizes 5-HT1A receptor-mediated actions of 5-HT, our data also demonstrate that the inhibitory action of 5-HT on excitatory synaptic transmission in CA1 is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.
