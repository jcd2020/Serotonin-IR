	ObjectivesNLX-112 (befiradol, F13640) is a selective serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Although it has been tested invivo, little has been reported on its in vitro signal transduction profile. MethodsNLX-112 was tested on G-protein activation, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) and receptor internalization in recombinant cell lines. NLX-112 was also tested on G-protein activation in rat hippocampal membranes. G subunit mRNA expression in cell lines and rat brain tissue was quantified by quantitative PCR. Key findingsFor all signalling measures, NLX-112 exhibited agonist efficacy greater than for reference compounds (()8-OH-DPAT or buspirone), but similar to the endogenous agonist, serotonin, and was more potent for pERK than other responses. In rat hippocampal membranes, NLX-112 stimulated total G-proteins' but, unlike (+/-)8-OH-DPAT and buspirone, was more potent for Go activation. Cell lines predominantly expressed Gi1 and Gi2 mRNA, with lowlevels of Go, whereas in rat brain Go subunits showed highest mRNA expression. ConclusionsUnlike reference compounds, NLX-112 was a highly efficacious agonist invitro, preferentially activating pERK in cell lines and Go proteins in rat hippocampal membranes. However, G subunit mRNA levels differ markedly between rat brain and cell lines, warranting caution when extrapolating from recombinant systems to native tissues.
