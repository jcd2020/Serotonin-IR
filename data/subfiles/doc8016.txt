Navailles, S., et al. (2013). "Role of 5-HT2C receptors in the enhancement of c-Fos expression induced by a 5-HT2B/2C inverse agonist and 5-HT2 agonists in the rat basal ganglia." Experimental Brain Research 230(4): 525-535.

	Some non-selective serotonin2C (5-HT2C) agonists or inverse agonists enhance the product of the proto-oncogene c-Fos within the basal ganglia, a group of brain regions involved in motor behavior and in the ability of these drugs to promote abnormal movements. The role of 5-HT2C receptors in these effects is unclear. The 5-HT2C antagonist SB243,213 (1 mg/kg), which enhanced Fos per se in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) only, was used to study the implication of 5-HT2C receptors. The agonists Ro 60-0175 (3 mg/kg) and m-CPP (1 mg/kg) and the inverse agonist SB206,553 (10 mg/kg) enhanced Fos expression in the STN and faintly in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN, the internal globus pallidus in primate). The effects of these drugs differed mainly in the striatum regarding the magnitude (m-CPP > Ro 60-0175 > SB243,213 > SB206,553) or the striatal quadrants (faint to no labeling in lateral striatum) and in the substantia nigra. None of these compounds enhanced Fos expression by themselves in the globus pallidus or in the EPN when combined with SB243,213. Their Fos effect in the STN was reduced significantly by SB243,213 only in the case of m-CPP. In the ventromedial striatum, SB243,213 reduced the effects of m-CPP while SB206,553 reduced the effects of SB243,213. The results show that opposite pharmacological agents alter similarly Fos expression in the EPN or the STN. Although some of the effects of 5-HT agents are related to targets other than 5-HT2C receptors, the study confirms the existence of multiple 5-HT2C receptor-dependent controls recruited by these drugs upon basal ganglia activity.
