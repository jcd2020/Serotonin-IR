	This study tested whether a new serotonin (5-HT1B) agonist, 3-(1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridyl)-5-propoxy-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridine (CP-93,129), could be used to study the potential role of 5-HT1B receptors in the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, and renin. CP-93,129 has a high affinity for 5-HT1B receptors but low affinity for other 5-HT receptor subtypes. In addition, CP-93,129 does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of ACTH, prolactin, and renin is known to be increased after activation of 5-HT receptors. ICV injections of CP-93,129 (100 micrograms/kg) increased the plasma concentrations of ACTH, prolactin, and renin. CP-93,129 also increased blood pressure and reduced heart rate. To determine whether these effects of CP-93,129 are centrally mediated, we compared them with IP injection of the same dose of CP-93,129. IP-injected CP-93,129 did not alter blood pressure or heart rate and did not elevate plasma prolactin and renin concentrations. To determine whether 5-HT1B receptors mediate the central effects of CP-93,129, rats were pretreated with the 5-HT antagonists l-propranolol or metergoline prior to ICV injections of doses of CP-93,129 (0-100 micrograms/kg). The 5-HT1A/1B/2A/2C antagonist metergoline (0.5 mg/kg, IP) failed to inhibit the CP-93,129-induced elevation of ACTH, prolactin, or renin concentrations. In contrast, the 5-HT1A/1B/beta antagonist l-propranolol (20 micrograms/kg, ICV) inhibited the renin but not the ACTH or prolactin responses to ICV CP-93,129.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
