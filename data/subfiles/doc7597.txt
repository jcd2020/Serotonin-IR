	The recently developed 5-HT2A receptor selective antagonist [3H]MDL100,907 ((+/-)2,3-dimethoxyphenyl-1-[2-(4-piperidine)-methanol]) has been characterized as a radioligand for the autoradiographic visualization of these receptors. [3H]MDL100,907 binding to rat brain tissue sections was saturable, had sub-nanomolar affinity (Kd = 0.2-0.3 nM), and presented a pharmacological profile consistent with its binding to 5-HT2A receptors (rank order of affinity for [3H]MDL100,907-labelled receptors: MDL100,907 > spiperone > ketanserin > mesulergine). The distribution of receptors labelled by [3H]MDL100,907 was compared to the autoradiographical patterns obtained with [3H]Ketanserin, [3H]Mesulergine, and [3H]RP62203 (N-[3-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-y1]propyl]-1,8-naphtalenes ultam) and to the distribution of 5-HT2A receptor mRNA as determined by in situ hybridization. As opposed to the other radioligands, [3H]MDL100,907 labelled a single population of sites (5-HT2A receptors) and presented extremely low levels of non-specific binding. The close similarity of the distributions of [3H]MDL100,907-labelled receptors and 5-HT2A mRNA further supports the selectivity of this radioligand for 5-HT2A receptors and suggests a predominant somatodendritic localization of these receptors. The present results point to [3H]MDL100,907 as the ligand of choice for the autoradiographic visualization of 5-HT2A receptors.
