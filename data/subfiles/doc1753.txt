Cervo, L. and R. Samanin (1995). "5-HT1A RECEPTOR FULL AND PARTIAL AGONISTS AND 5-HT2C (BUT NOT 5-HT3) RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS INCREASE RATES OF PUNISHED RESPONDING IN RATS." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 52(4): 671-676.

	Drugs with different intrinsic activity at 5-HT1A receptors and antagonists at 5-HT2A/2C and 5-HT3 receptors were studied for their ability to increase the rates of punished operant responding in rats. Like chlordiazepoxide (5 and 10 mg/kg) and diazepam (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg), 0.125 mg/kg 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, and 5 and 10 mg/kg ipsapirone, a partial agonist at these receptors, increased the rates of punished responding, whereas (8)-WAY 100135, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, had no effect at doses from 1 to 10 mg/kg. 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone, like benzodiazepines, significantly reduced unpunished responding. The 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists ritanserin (2 mg/kg), mianserin (8 mg/kg), and mesulergine (0.1 mg/kg) significantly increased the rates of punished responding, whereas 0.5-2 mg/kg ketanserin, that has higher affinity for 5-HT2A than 5-HT2C receptors, had no effect. Antagonists, at 5-HT3 receptors such as ondansetron (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and tropisetron (0.001-0.1 mg/kg), had no effect on punished or unpunished responding. The results show that agents acting as full or partial agonists at 5-HT1A receptors and blockers of postsynaptic 5-HT2C receptors have anxiolytic-like effects in a model of punished operant responding, whereas antagonists at 5-HT1A and 5-HT3 receptors have no such effect.
