	Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is known to be a promising treatment for resistant depression, which acts via the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system in the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (ILPFC). Previous study revealed that dysfunction of brain 5-HT homeostasis is related to a valproate (VPA)-induced rat autism spectrum disorder (ASD) model. Whether ILPFC DBS rescues deficits in VPA-induced offspring through the 5-HT system is not known. Using VPA-induced offspring, we therefore explored the effect of DBS in autistic phenotypes and further investigated the underlying mechanism. Using combined behavioral and molecular approaches, we observed that applying DBS and 5-HT1A receptor agonist treatment with 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) reversed sociability deficits, anxiety and hyperactivity in the VPA-exposed offspring. We then administered the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclohexanecarboxamide maleate (WAY 100635), following which the effect of DBS in terms of improving autistic behaviors was blocked in the VPA-exposed offspring. Furthermore, we found that both 8-OH-DPAT and DBS treatment rescued autistic behaviors by decreasing the expressions of NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and the beta(3) subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)R) in the PFC region. These results provided the first evidence of characteristic behavioral changes in VPA-induced offspring caused by DBS via the 5-HT system in the ILPFC.
