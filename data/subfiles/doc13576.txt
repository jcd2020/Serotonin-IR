Wolf, W. A. and D. M. Kuhn (1991). "THE 5-HT TRANSPORTER IS AN ADDITIONAL SITE OF ACTION FOR THE 5-HT AGONISTS RU 24969 AND TFMPP." Neurochem Int 19(1-2): 39-44.

	A variety of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonists and related compounds were tested for their ability to interact with the 5-HT transporter by analyzing: (1) inhibition of synaptosomal uptake of 5-HT; (2) competition for the specific binding of [H-3]paroxetine to the 5-HT transporter and; (3) stimulation of 5-HT efflux from synaptosomes. The results indicate that compounds which exhibit moderate to high affinity for the 5-HT1B binding site also exhibit moderate to high potency for inhibiting 5-HT uptake (K1 = 28 and 291 nM for RU 24969 and TFMPP, respectively). Moreover, the same series of compounds also compete for [H-3]paroxetine binding (K1 = 20 and 387 nM for RU 24969 and TFMPP, respectively) and can, to varying degrees, induce 5-HT efflux from synaptosomes. These data suggest that some ligands which are active at the 5-HT1B receptor will also interact with the 5-HT transporter to modify the synaptic availability of 5-HT.
