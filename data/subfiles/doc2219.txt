Choi, I. S., et al. (2012). "5-HT(1B) receptors inhibit glutamate release from primary afferent terminals in rat medullary dorsal horn neurons." Br J Pharmacol 167(2): 356-367.

	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Although 5-HT(1B) receptors are expressed in trigeminal sensory neurons, it is still not known whether these receptors can modulate nociceptive transmission from primary afferents onto medullary dorsal horn neurons. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Primary afferent-evoked EPSCs were recorded from medullary dorsal horn neurons of rat horizontal brain stem slices using a conventional whole-cell patch clamp technique under a voltage-clamp condition. KEY RESULTS: CP93129, a selective 5-HT(1B) receptor agonist, reversibly and concentration-dependently decreased the amplitude of glutamatergic EPSCs and increased the paired-pulse ratio. In addition, CP93129 reduced the frequency of spontaneous miniature EPSCs without affecting the current amplitude. The CP93129-induced inhibition of EPSCs was significantly occluded by GR55562, a 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor antagonist, but not LY310762, a 5-HT(1D) receptor antagonist. Sumatriptan, an anti-migraine drug, also decreased EPSC amplitude, and this effect was partially blocked by either GR55562 or LY310762. On the other hand, primary afferent-evoked EPSCs were mediated by the Ca(2+) influx passing through both presynaptic N-type and P/Q-type Ca(2+) channels. The CP93129-induced inhibition of EPSCs was significantly occluded by omega-conotoxin GVIA, an N-type Ca(2+) channel blocker. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The present results suggest that the activation of presynaptic 5-HT(1B) receptors reduces glutamate release from primary afferent terminals onto medullary dorsal horn neurons, and that 5-HT(1B) receptors could be, at the very least, a potential target for the treatment of pain from orofacial tissues.
