	The mechanism by which antagonists down-regulate 5-HT2A receptors in unknown. We here report that a variety of 5-HT2A antagonists induce a change in the subcellular distribution of 5-HT2A receptors both in vitro and in vivo. In a stably transfected NIH 3T3 cell-line, brief exposure to 1 muM clozapine caused a 2.5-fold increase in intracellular 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity, as measured by confocal microscopy. Confirmatory studies utilizing a biotin-trap technique, demonstrated that the increase in intracellular immunoreactivity results from internalization of receptor from the cell surface. Exposure of transfected cells to other 5-HT2A receptor antagonists produced similar increases in intracellular 5-HT2A-like immunoreactivity. In vivo administration of clozapine (20 mg/kg, sc, X 7 days) caused a greater than twofold increase in intracellular immunoreactivity in cell bodies of cortical pyramidal neurons. Additionally, chronic clozapine administration was associated with decrease in labeling of apical dendrites on pyramidal cells. These results show that clozapine causes a change in subcellular distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in vitro and in vivo.
