	Anew antimigraine drug - Tropoxin (3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyloxyimino)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[1-3]octane hydrochloride) - was developed and was found to prevent or significantly weaken the constrictor reactions of cerebral arteries evoked by serotonin (5-HT) or the 5-HT2B/2C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) in intact animals and in animals with ischemic brain damage. Tropoxin showed affinity for5-HT2 receptors in the brain and had antiaggregatory actions. It had no marked neurotropic properties and did not alter blood pressure responses to noradrenaline, acetylcholine, or histamine. Pilot clinical trials of Tropoxin provided evidence that it has high efficacy in the interictal treatment of frequent and severe migraine attacks.
