Laaris, N., et al. (1997). "Stress-induced alterations of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor sensitivity in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus--in vitro electrophysiological evidence." Fundam Clin Pharmacol 11(3): 206-214.

	Somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors play a key role in the control of the electrical and metabolic activity of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. These neurons also possess intracellular glucocorticoid receptors which may be involved in the well established modulation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) metabolism by corticosterone in stressed animals. The possible mediation by somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors of such corticosterone-dependent changes in serotoninergic neuron activity was investigated using an in vitro electrophysiological approach. 5-HT1A autoreceptor-mediated inhibition of the firing of serotoninergic neurons was examined in brain stem slices from rats whose serum corticosterone concentrations had been markedly increased (+100-200%) by two different stressful conditions. Immobilization for 30 or 90 min (restraint stress) did not modify the concentration-dependent inhibition of the firing of serotoninergic neurons by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist ipsapirone. In contrast, placing the rats in novel uncontrolled environmental conditions for 16 h significantly reduced the cell response to ipsapirone, indicating a decreased sensitivity of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Such a change was not observed in adrenalectomized rats subjected to the same stressful conditions. These data show that some forms of stress can reduce the 5-HT1A autoreceptor-dependent inhibitory control of the electrophysiological activity of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Both the nature and duration of stress seem to be critical factors for triggering the (corticosterone-dependent) mechanism(s) responsible for the functional desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors in stressed rats.
