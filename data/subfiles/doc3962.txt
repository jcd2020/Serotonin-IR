Grasso, C., et al. (2006). "Aminergic control of neuronal firing rate in thalamic motor nuclei of the rat." Arch Ital Biol 144(3-4): 173-196.

	The effects induced on neuronal firing by microiontophoretic application of the biological amines noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were studied "in vivo" in ventral-anterior (VA) and ventrolateral (VL) thalamic motor nuclei of anaesthetized rats. In both nuclei the amines had a mostly depressive action on neuronal firing rate, the percentage of units responsive to NA application (88%) being higher than to 5-HT (72%). Short-lasting (less than 2 min) and long lasting (up to 20 min) inhibitory responses were recorded, the former mostly evoked by NA and the latter by 5-HT ejection. In some cases 5-HT application had no effect on the firing rate but modified the firing pattern. NA-evoked responses were significantly more intense in VL than in VA neurons. Short-lasting inhibitory responses similar to NA-induced effects were evoked by the alpha2 adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine and to a lesser extent by the beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. Inhibitory responses to 5-HT were partially mimicked by application of the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and of the 5-HT2 receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (ALPHA-MET-5-HT). The latter evoked excitatory responses in some cases. Both 5-HT agonists were more effective on VA than on VL neurons. The effects evoked by agonists were at least partially blocked by respective antagonists. These results suggest that although both 5-HT and NA depress neuronal firing rate, their effects differ in time course and in the amount of inhibition; besides aminergic modulation is differently exerted on VA and VL.
