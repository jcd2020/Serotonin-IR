Dupuis, D. S., et al. (1998). "Autoradiography of serotonin 5-HT1A receptor-activated G proteins in guinea pig brain sections by agonist-stimulated S-35 GTP gamma S binding." Journal of Neurochemistry 70(3): 1258-1268.

	G protein activation mediated by serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B/D receptors in guinea pig brain was investigated by using quantitative autoradiography of agonist-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding to brain sections, [S-35]GTP gamma S binding was stimulated by the mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT1B/D agonist L694247 in brain structures enriched in 5-HT1A binding sites, i.e., hippocampus (+140 +/- 14%), dorsal raphe (+70 +/- 8%), lateral septum (+52 +/- 12%), cingulate (+36 +/- 8%), and entorhinal cortex (+34 +/- 5%), L694247 caused little or no stimulation of [S-35] GTP gamma S binding in brain regions with high densities of 5-HT1B/D binding sites (e.g., substantia nigra, striatum, central gray, and dorsal subiculum). The [S-35]GTP gamma S binding response was antagonized by WAY100635 (10 mu M) and methiothepin (10 mu M). In contrast, the 5-HT1B inverse agonist SB224289 (10 mu M) did not affect the L694247-mediated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding response, and the mixed 5-HT1B/D antagonist GR127935 (10 mu M) yielded a partial blockade. The distribution pattern of the [S-35]GTP gamma S binding response and the antagonist profile suggest the L694247-mediated response in guinea pig brain to be mediated by 5-HT1A receptors. In addition to L694247, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin, and flesinoxan also stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding; their maximal responses varied between 46 and 52% compared with L694247, irrespective of the brain structure being considered. Sumatriptan, rizatriptan, and zolmitriptan (10 mu M) stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding in the hippocampus by 20-50%, Naratriptan, CP122638, and dihydroergotamine stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding to a similar level as L694247 in hippocampus, lateral septum, and dorsal raphe. It appears that under the present experimental conditions, G protein activation through 5-HT1A but not 5-HT1B/D receptors can be measured in guinea pig brain sections.
