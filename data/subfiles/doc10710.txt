Suehiro, M., et al. (1998). "In vivo biodistribution of a radiotracer for imaging serotonin-1A receptor sites with PET: C-11 LY274601." Life Sciences 63(17): 1533-1542.

	LY274601 [R-(+)-8-thiomethyl-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin], a full agonist of the 5-HT1A receptor with high affinity and selectivity, was labeled with C-11 and H-3, and its in vivo behavior was studied to evaluate [C-11]LY274601 as a PET radiotracer for imaging 5-HT1A receptor sites in living brain. Following intravenous tail injection into mice, [C-11]LY274601 showed high blood-brain barrier permeability and accumulated in regions known to have high densities of 5-HT1A receptor sites such as the brain stem including the raphe nuclei. The binding of the radiotracer in target tissues is blocked by pre-injection of the 5-HT1A receptor selective ligand 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg, sc), suggesting that the binding is specific to 5-HT1A receptor sites. Using ex vivo autoradiography, the target tissues such as hippocamous CA1-4 fields, piriform cortex, dorsal raphe nucleus and lateral septum were visualized as hot spots. These tissues were observed to have binding 2 - 2.7 times greater than the cerebellum. The distribution of the radiotracer agrees well with the distribution of 5-HT1A receptors revealed by in vitro autoradiography with [H-3]8-OH-DPAT. However, the radiotracer was metabolized quickly and cleared from target tissues with a half life of approximately 15 min. [C-11]LY274601 showed high non-specific binding in regions with low number of 5-HT1A receptor sites such as cerebellum.
