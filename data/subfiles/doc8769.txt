Perrone, R., et al. (1994). "Mixed 5-HT1A/D-2 activity of a new model of arylpiperazines: 1-aryl-4-[3-(1,2-dihydronaphthalen-4-yl)-n-propyl]piperazines. 1. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships." J Med Chem 37(1): 99-104.

	A new model of 4-alkyl-1-arylpiperazines containing a terminal dihydronaphthalene fragment on the alkyl chain was synthesized in order to have mixed serotonergic and dopaminergic activity and to pursue the recent alternative approaches to the discovery of novel antipsychotic and anxiolytic agents. Title compounds were evaluated for in vitro activity on dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors by radioreceptor binding assays. They show high nanomolar affinity for 5-HT1A, moderate affinity for D-2, and low affinity for 5-HT2 receptors, and in particular, two compounds, 4-[3-(1,2-dihydro-6-methoxynaphthalen-4-yl)-n-propyl]-1-(2- methoxyphenyl)piperazine (8) and 4-[3-(1,2-dihydro-8-methoxynaphthalen-4-yl)-n-propyl]-1-(2- pyridyl)piperazine (15), show values (nM) of IC50 = 2.0 and 1.4 for 5-HT1A and IC50 = 90.6 and 119.3 for D-2, respectively. Some in vivo behavioral studies show compound 8 to be an antagonist on 5-HT1A receptors. These first findings place the new arylpiperazines on the same level as that of the azaspirone class, e.g., 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)-n-butyl]piperazine (NAN-190) and buspirone.
