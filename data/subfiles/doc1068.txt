"Neuropharmacological and neurochemical evaluation of N-n-propyl-3-ethoxyquinoxaline-2-carboxamide (6n): a novel serotonergic 5-HT3 receptor antagonist for co-morbid antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like potential using traumatic brain injury model in rats." J Basic Clin Physiol Pharmacol 28(2): 93-100.

	BACKGROUND: Several preclinical studies have shown that serotonergic 5-HT3 receptor antagonists play an important role in the management of neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety. In the present study the compound "6n" (N-n-propyl-3-ethoxyquinoxaline-2-carboxamide), a novel 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with an optimal log P (2.52) and pA2 (7.6) value was screened for its neuro-pharmacological potential in chronic rodent models of depression and anxiety named traumatic brain injury (TBI). METHODS: In this model, a 1 cm midline scalp incision was made, and the muscles were retracted to expose the skull. A stainless steel disc (10 mm in diameter and 3 mm in depth) was placed centrally between the lambda and bregma regions. The injury was induced using the impact acceleration model of TBI. Specifically, a 400 g metal weight was dropped from a height of 1 m guided by a straight pipe, onto the metal disc placed over the rat's skull. RESULTS: The behavioral anomalies of the TBI rats were attenuated by the chronic treatment of compound 6n (1 and 2 mg/kg, p.o.; 14 days) as observed by the modified open field test (ambulation, rearing, and fecal pellet), sucrose consumption test (% sucrose consumption), elevated plus maze [% open arm entries [OAE] and % time spent in open arm (TSOA)], and marble burying test (numbers). In addition, 6n also increased the levels of neurotransmitters (norepinephrine and serotonin) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in TBI rats. CONCLUSIONS: The result suggests that compound 6n exhibited antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects in rodent models of depression and anxiety.
