	The antinociceptive activity of paracetamol in the hot plate and formalin tests was studied to establish the relationship between antinociceptive activity and the central serotonergic system. Significant antinociceptive activity of paracetamol was observed in the formalin test at the dose of 300 mg/kg, while, at the dose of 400 mg/kg, the drug was active both in the formalin and in the hot-plate test. Serum paracetamol levels remained sub-toxic and the behavioral profile remained unchanged. Depletion of brain serotonin with p-chlorophenylalanine prevented the antinociceptive effect of paracetamol in the hot-plate test and in the first phase of the formalin response. Paracetamol significantly increased the serotonin content in the pontine and cortical areas (by 75 and 70%, respectively). The pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine reduced the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) content in cortical and pontine areas to 12 and 19% of baseline values, respectively, and prevented the enhancement induced by paracetamol. The maximum number of cortical 5-HT2 receptors was reduced by paracetamol, while the number of 5-HT1A receptors in both cortical and pontine areas was unchanged. Pre-treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine prevented the reduction in the number of 5-HT2 receptors induced by paracetamol. These results provide evidence for the involvement of the central serotonergic system in the antinociceptive effect of paracetamol in the hot plate and formalin tests.
