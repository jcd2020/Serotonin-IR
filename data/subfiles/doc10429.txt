Smith, L. M. and S. J. Peroutka (1986). "Differential effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine1a selective drugs on the 5-HT behavioral syndrome." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 24(6): 1513-1519.

	The effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeODMT), buspirone and isapirone were examined at 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) binding sites and on the 5-HT behavioral syndrome in the rat. 8-OH-DPAT, 5-MeODMT, buspirone and isapirone are all potent inhibitors of 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding to rat brain membranes (Ki values = 1.9-13 nM). However, these drugs have differential effects on the 5-HT behavioral syndrome. 8-OH-DPAT, 5-MeODMT and buspirone induce hindlimb abduction, flattened body posture and Straub tail. Isapirone induces only a slight flattening of body posture. By contrast, 8-OH-DPAT and 5-MeODMT, but not buspirone and isapirone, and isapirone, also induce forepaw treading, head-weaving and tremor. However, both buspirone and isapirone antagonize the induction of these three behaviors by 8-OH-DPAT or 5-MeODMT. These data show that 8-OH-DPAT and 5-MeODMT are "full agonists" in relation to six components of the 5-HT behavioral syndrome. Buspirone and isapirone, on the other hand, act as "antagonists" in relation to forepaw treading, head-weaving and tremor. Therefore, these data suggest that specific components of the 5-HT behavioral syndrome are mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.
