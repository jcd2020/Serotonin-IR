Ward, S. E., et al. (2008). "Discovery of potent, orally bioavailable, selective 5-HT1A/B/D receptor antagonists." J Med Chem 51(10): 2887-2890.

	5-HT1 receptor antagonists have been discovered with good selectivity over the 5-HT transporter. This is the first report of highly potent, selective ligands for the 5-HT1A/B/D receptors with low intrinsic activity, which represent a useful set of molecules for further understanding the roles of the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes and providing new approaches for the treatment of depression.
