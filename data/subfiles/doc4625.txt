	We have conducted a pharmacological challenge experiment in 10 medication-free obsessive compulsive (OC) disorder (OCD) patients. We used a placebo-controlled paradigm for m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and sumatriptan challenges. Endocrine, physiological and behavioral variables were assessed at baseline and over a 3-hour period after the challenge. Both cortisol and prolactin were significantly elevated in OCD patients following mCPP administration. Both mCPP and sumatriptan caused significant OC symptom exacerbation with the response to sumatriptan being more robust. We conclude that the 5-HT1Dbeta receptor may play a role in the pathophysiology of OCD. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.
