	Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS) is highly prevalent and affects the overall functioning of patients. Clozapine (Clz), an atypical antipsychotic drug, significantly improves CIAS although the underlying mechanisms remain under study. The role of the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1A-R) in the ability of Clz to prevent the learning/memory impairment induced by MK-801 was investigated using the modified elevated plus-maze (mEPM) considering the Transfer latency (TL) as an index of spatial memory. We also investigated if changes in hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels underlie the behavioral prevention induced by Clz. Clz (0.5 and 1 mg/kg)- or vehicle-pretreated Wistar rats were injected with MK-801 (0.05 mg/kg) or saline. TL was evaluated 35 min later (TL1, acquisition session) while learning/memory performance was measured 24 h (TL2, retention session) and 48 h later (TL3, long-lasting effect). WAY-100635, a 5-HT1A-R antagonist, was pre-injected (0.3 mg/kg) to examine the presumed 5-HT1A-R involvement in Clz action. At TL2, another experimental group treated with Clz and MK-801 and its respective control groups were added to measure BDNF protein levels by ELISA. TL1 and TL3 were not significantly modified by the different treatments. MK-801 increased TL2 compared to control group leading a disruption of spatial memory processing which was markedly attenuated by Clz. WAY 100635 suppressed this action supporting a relevant role of 5-HT1A-R in the Clz mechanism of action to improve spatial memory dysfunction. Although a significant decrease of hippocampal BDNF levels underlies the learning/memory impairment induced by MK-801, this effect was not significantly prevented by Clz.
