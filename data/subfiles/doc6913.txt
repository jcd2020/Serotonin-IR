Marcoli, M., et al. (1998). "Trazodone is a potent agonist at 5-HT2C receptors mediating inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate nitric oxide cyclic GMP pathway in rat cerebellum." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 285(3): 983-986.

	The effects of trazodone on the cyclic GMP elevation elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartate in rat cerebellar slices were analyzed. Trazodone inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 0.82 nM) the cyclic GMP response evoked by 0.1 mu M N-methyl-D-aspartate. The inhibition was near complete at 10 nM trazodone, The effect of 10 nM trazodone was unaffected by 0.3 mu M spiperone or rauwolscine, antagonists with selectivity for the 5-HT(serotonin)(2A) or the 5-HT2B subtype, respectively, but it was totally prevented by 0.01 mu M mesulergine, a 5-HT2A/5-HT2B/5-HT2C receptor antagonist. Trazodone was potently counteracted (IC50 = 2.7 nM) by the selective 5-HT2B/5-HT2C receptor antagonist N-(1-methyl-5-indolyl)-N-(3-pyridil) urea HCl and, less potently (IC50 = 95 nM), by ketanserin, a 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptor blocker. It is concluded that trazodone behaves as a potent full agonist at the 5-HT50 receptor mediating inhibition of the cerebellar N-methyl-D-aspartate/nitric oxide/cyclic GMP system.
