Erfani, M., et al. (2013). "Tc-99m-labeling of a dithiocarbamate-DWAY fragment using (TcN)-Tc-99m (2+) core for the preparation of potential 5HT(1A) receptor imaging agents." Journal of Radioanalytical and Nuclear Chemistry 295(3): 1783-1788.

	1-(2-methoxy phenyl) piperazine fragment of WAY100635 or its phenolic analogue, derived from DWAY is used to design the desired structure of 5HT(1A) receptor imaging agents. In this study a DWAY analogue was labeled with Tc-99m-nitrido ([(TcN)-Tc-99m](2+)) core via dithiocarbamate. 2-(piperazin-1-yl) phenol dithiocarbamate was synthesized by the reaction of 2-(piperazin-1-yl) phenol with an equivalent amount of carbon disulfide in KOH solution then radiolabeled with Tc-99m-nitrido core. The final complex was characterized by HPLC and its radiochemical purity was more than 90 %. In vitro stability studies have shown the complex was stable at least 4 h after labeling at room temperature. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient experiment demonstrated log p = 1.34 for (TcN)-Tc-99m-OHPP-DTC. Biodistribution results showed that radio tracer had moderate brain uptake (0.39 +/- A 0.03 %ID/g at 15 min and 0.29 +/- A 0.02 %ID/g at 120 min) and good retention, suggesting that this complex may lead to a further development of a radiotracer with specific binding to 5-HT1A receptor.
