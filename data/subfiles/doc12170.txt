Stephenson, K. A., et al. (2011). "Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of derivatives of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist HX-CH 44." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 21(18): 5506-5509.

	Isopropyl- and fluoroisopropyl-amino derivatives of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist 2-[4-[3-(tert-butyl-amino)-2-hydroxypropoxy]phenyl]-3-methyl-6-methoxy-4(3H)-quinazolinone ((+/-) HX-CH 44) were synthesized, including a concise and efficient preparation of the core, 2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-6-methoxy-3-methylquinazolin-4(3H)-one. In vitro binding assays showed that the fluorinated analog was selective towards beta(1)-adrenergic receptors over beta(2)-adrenergic and 5-HT1A receptors. An X-ray crystallographic characterization of the fluorinated analog is also reported. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
