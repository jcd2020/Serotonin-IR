Cai, C. Y., et al. (2019). "Extracellular regulated protein kinaseis critical for the role of 5-HT1a receptor in modulating nNOS expression and anxiety-related behaviors." Behav Brain Res 357-358: 88-97.

	Our previous study found that serotonin 1A receptor (5-HT1aR) is an endogenous suppressor of nNOS expression in the hippocampus, which accounts for anxiolytic effect of fluoxetine. However, the precise molecular mechanism remains unknown. By using 8-OH-DPAT, a selective 5-HT1aR agonist, NAN-190, a selective 5-HT1aR antagonist, and U0126, an Extracellular Regulated Protein Kinases (ERK) phosphorylation inhibitor, we investigated the role of ERK in 5-HT1aR-nNOS pathway. Western blots analysis demonstrated that 5-HT1aR activation up-regulated the level of phosphorylated ERK (P-ERK) beginning at 5min and down-regulated the expression of nNOS beginning at 20min. Meanwhile, blockage of 5-HT1aR resulted in a decrease in P-ERK beginning at 20min and caused an increase in nNOS expression beginning at 6h. Although U0126 itself did not alter nNOS expression and activity, NO level, and anxiety-related behaviors, the treatment totally reversed 8-OH-DPAT-induced reduction in nNOS expression and function, and anxiolytic effect. Besides, our data showed that ERK phosphorylation was essential for 5-HT1aR activation-induced cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis of newborn neuron. Our study suggests a crucial role of ERK phosphorylation in the regulation of nNOS expression by 5-HT1aR, which is helpful for understanding the mechanism of 5-HT1aR-based anxiolytic treatment.
