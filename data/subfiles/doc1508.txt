Caill√©, F., et al. (2013). "Synthesis and biological evaluation of positron emission tomography radiotracers targeting serotonin 4 receptors in brain: [18F]MNI-698 and [18F]MNI-699." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 23(23): 6243-6247.

	Two new benzodioxane derivatives were synthesized as candidates to image the serotonin 4 receptors by positron emission tomography (PET) and radiolabeled with fluorine-18 via a two-step procedure. Competition binding assays demonstrated that MNI-698 and MNI-699 had sub-nanomolar binding affinities against rat striatal 5-HT4 receptors (Ki of 0.20 and 0.07 nM, respectively). PET imaging in rhesus monkey showed that the regional brain distribution of [(18)F]MNI-698 and [(18)F]MNI-699 were consistent with the known densities of 5-HT4 in brain. [(18)F]MNI-698 and [(18)F]MNI-699 are among the first fluorine-18 radiotracers developed for imaging the 5-HT4 receptors in vivo and are currently under preclinical investigation in primates for future human use.
