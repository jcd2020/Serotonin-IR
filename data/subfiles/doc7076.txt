Matrisciano, F., et al. (2008). "Synergism between fluoxetine and the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist, LY379268, in an in vitro model for antidepressant drug-induced neurogenesis." Neuropharmacology 54(2): 428-437.

	We examined the interaction between the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, and group-II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors using progenitor cells isolated from cultured cerebellar granule cells, considered as an in vitro model of antidepressant-drug induced neurogenesis. These cells expressed mGlu3 receptors negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. A 72-h treatment with either fluoxetine or low concentrations of mGlu2/3 receptor agonists (LY379268 or 2R,4R-APDC) enhanced cell proliferation. The action of fluoxetine was mediated by the activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors. We found a strong synergism between fluoxetine and LY379268 in enhancing cell proliferation and inhibiting cAMP formation. The increased cell proliferation induced by fluoxetine+LY379268 was abrogated by the cAMP analogue, 8-Br-cAMP, as well as by drugs that inhibit the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidyilinositol-3-kinase pathways. Interestingly, fluoxetine and LY379268 also acted synergistically in promoting neuronal differentiation when progenitor cells were incubated in the presence of serum. These data support the hypothesis that a combination between classical antidepressants and mGlu2/3 receptor agonists may be helpful in the experimental treatment of depression.
