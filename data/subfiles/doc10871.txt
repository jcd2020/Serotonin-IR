Roberts, C., et al. (1997). "The role of 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors in the modulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine levels in the frontal cortex of the conscious guinea pig." Eur J Pharmacol 326(1): 23-30.

	The role of 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors in modulating extracellular 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the guinea pig was investigated with the non-selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor inverse agonist, methiothepin, and the selective 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor partial agonists, GR 127935 (n-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperizinyl)phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-me thyl-1,2,4-oxadiazole-3-yl)[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-carboxamide) and GR 125743 (n-[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperizinyl)phenyl]-3-methyl-4-(4-pyri dinyl)benzamide). Extracellular 5-HT levels were measured using the technique of brain microdialysis, in the frontal cortex of the freely moving guinea-pig. Extracellular 5-HT was tetrodotoxin sensitive and calcium dependent, and increased when perfused with a high concentration of K+. In addition, extracellular 5-HT levels were lowered by the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist, sumatriptan, and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, while perfusion of the selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, paroxetine, increased 5-HT in a concentration-dependent manner. Perfusion of methiothepin, GR 127935 and GR 125743 into the frontal cortex caused significant but transient increases of extracellular 5-HT. However, systemic administration of methiothepin, GR 127935 and GR 125743, at 0.3 mg/kg i.p., produced significant decreases in extracellular 5-HT, to minima of 27 +/- 3%, 31 +/- 12% and 27 +/- 13% of basal, respectively. The increase of extracellular 5-HT, following 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor inverse and partial agonist perfusion into the frontal cortex, was probably a consequence of attenuation of an endogenous 5-HT tone at terminal 5-HT autoreceptors. The unexpected decrease in 5-HT levels following systemic administration may be a result of additional attenuation of endogenous 5-HT tone at cell body autoreceptors in the raphe. Such an increase in local 5-HT levels could then stimulate 5-HT1A receptors to inhibit cell firing and hence decrease 5-HT levels in the terminal regions. This was confirmed when co-administration of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635, significantly attenuated the GR 127935 decrease in 5-HT.
