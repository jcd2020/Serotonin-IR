Tomkins, D. M., et al. (1994). "LOW-DOSES OF THE 5-HT1A AGONIST 8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN (8-OH DPAT) INCREASE ETHANOL INTAKE." Psychopharmacology 115(1-2): 173-179.

	Previous work has reported that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) agonist, 8-hydroxy 2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH DPAT), reduces ethanol intake by rats. However, as 8-OH DPAT reduces 5-HT neurotransmission, these findings are inconsistent with the proposed inhibitory role of central 5-HT neurons on ethanol intake. We examined the effect of 8-OH DPAT on ethanol, water and food intake in rats maintained on a limited access schedule using a lower dose range (6-250 mu g/kg) and by assessing concomitant changes in behaviour. Low doses of 8-OH DPAT enhanced ethanol intake even when food and water were offered as alternatives. Suppression in ethanol intake was observed at higher doses where elements of the 5-HT syndrome were apparent. Similar observations were made in both fluid and non-fluid deprived water drinking rats, suggesting the tatter effect is non-selective. Therefore 8-OH DPAT may both increase or decrease ethanol consumption in the rat depending on the dose used.
