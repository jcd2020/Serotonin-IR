Kugaya, A., et al. (2003). "Increase in prefrontal cortex serotonin(2A) receptors following estrogen treatment in postmenopausal women." American Journal of Psychiatry 160(8): 1522-1524.

	Objective: This study investigated the effect of estrogen on brain serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors in postmenopausal women and whether there was any correlation of receptor changes with cognition and mood. Method: Ten postmenopausal subjects underwent positron emission tomography measurements of 5-HT2A receptor binding with [F-18]deuteroaltanserin before and after estrogen replacement therapy. Results: 5-HT2A receptor binding was significantly increased after estrogen replacement therapy in the right prefrontal cortex (right precentral gyrus [Brodmann's area 9], inferior frontal gyrus [Brodmann's area 47], medial frontal gyrus [Brodmann's area 6, 10] and the anterior cingulate cortex [Brodmann's area 32]). in the inferior frontal gyrus. [Brodmann's area 44]), receptor up-regulation was correlated with change in plasma estradiol. Verbal fluency and Trail Making Test performance, but not mood, were significantly improved by estrogen without correlation with receptor changes. Conclusions: Estrogen increases 5-HT2A receptor binding in human prefrontal regions.
