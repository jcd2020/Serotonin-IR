	Our previous work indicates that type and level of dietary fat influences selection of protein and carbohydrate diets. Serotonin (5HT) appears to be involved in this feeding behavior. In the present study, we examined the effects of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) on feeding behavior, and fenfluramine on in vitro 5HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5HIAA) release from the brain in rats fed tallow or corn oil. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were given a diet containing corn oil or tallow for 2 days. In Experiment 1, rats received an injection of 8-OH-DPAT (a 5HT1A agonist) or saline and were then allowed to select from two diets: low protein/high carbohydrate or high protein/low carbohydrate. Prior exposure to tallow caused an increased intake of protein and 8-OH-DPAT blunted this effect. In Experiment 2, the dorsal raphe from rats fed tallow or corn oil was superfused with fenfluramine or vehicle. Superfusates were collected for analysis of 5HT and 5HIAA. Fenfluramine increased serotonin release in tallow-fed animals as compared to basal. These results suggest that serotonin may be involved in mediating tallow's effect on macronutrient selection.
