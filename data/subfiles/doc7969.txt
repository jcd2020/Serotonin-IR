	We report the synthesis of new compounds 4-35 based on structural modifications of different moieties of previously described lead UCM-2550. The new nonpiperazine derivatives, representing second-generation agonists, were assessed for binding affinity, selectivity, and functional activity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor (5-HT(1A)R). Computational beta(2)-based homology models of the ligand-receptor complexes were used to explain the observed structure-affinity relationships. Selected candidates were also evaluated for their potential in vitro and in vivo neuroprotective properties. Interestingly, compound 26 (2-{6-[(3,4-dihydro-2H-chromen-2-ylmethyl)amino]hexyl}tetrahydro-1H-pyrrolo[1,2-c ]imidazole-1,3(2H)-dione) has been characterized as a high-affinity and potent 5-HT(1A)R agonist (K(i) = 5.9 nM, EC(50) = 21.8 nM) and exhibits neuroprotective effect in neurotoxicity assays in primary cell cultures from rat hippocampus and in the MCAO model of focal cerebral ischemia in rats.
