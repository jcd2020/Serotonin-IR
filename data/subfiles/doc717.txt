Batool, F., et al. (2010). "Dose-related effects of clozapine and risperidone on the pattern of brain regional serotonin and dopamine metabolism and on tests related to extrapyramidal functions in rats." Acta Pharm 60(2): 129-140.

	The present study was designed to evaluate the behavioral and neurochemical profiles of clozapine and risperidone in rats in a dose-dependent manner. Animals injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with clozapine (2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1) or risperidone (1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg kg-1) were sacrificed 1 h later to collect brain samples. Hypolocomotive effects (home cage activity and catalepsy) were successively monitored in each animal after the drug or saline administration. Both drugs significantly (p < 0.01) decreased locomotor activity at high doses and in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum (100%) cataleptic potential was achieved at a high dose (5.0 mg kg-1) of risperidone. Neurochemical estimations were carried out by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Both drugs, at all doses, significantly (p < 0.01) increased the concentration of homovanillic acid (HVA), a metabolite of dopamine (DA), in the striatum. Dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) levels increased in the striatum and decreased in the rest of the brain, particularly in clozapine-injected rats. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), the predominant metabolite of serotonin, significantly (p < 0.01) decreased in the striatum. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was significantly (p < 0.01) increased by risperidone and decreased by clozapine in the rest of the brain. Striatal tryptophan (TRP) was significantly (p < 0.01) decreased by risperidone and increased in the rest of the brain. The striatal HVA/DA ratio increased and the 5-HT turnover rate remained unchanged in the rest of the brain. Results suggest that the affinity of the two drugs towards D2/5-HT1A receptors interaction is involved in lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects. Role of 5-HT1A receptors in the treatment of schizophrenia is discussed.
