	Radiolabeled derivatives of WAY-100635 have been shown to be important for imaging in vivo because of their antagonist properties and their specificity for the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor. Our goal is to prepare a series of radiofluorinated derivatives of WAY-100635 that, in the rat, range in pharmacokinetic properties from nearly irreversible to reversible in their behavior. It appears that derivatives containing a cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (e.g., FCWAY) with its high affinity and high target to nontarget contrast, has properties suited to measure receptor concentration. Derivatives based on phenylcarboxamide (e.g., FBWAY and MeFBAWAY) have properties more suited to the measurement of changes in endogenous serotonin. The compound containing the pyrimidine moiety in place of the pyridine moeity in FBWAY (FBWAY 1,3N) appears to have intermediate properties. NUCL MED BIOL 27;5:457-462, 2000.
