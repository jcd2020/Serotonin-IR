	Like other biogenic amine G protein-coupled receptors, mutation of the conserved aspartatic residue into alanine at position 116 (D116A(3.32)) in the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) receptor greatly affects 5-HT binding and signal transduction. [(3)H]8-Hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and [(3)H]-N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY100,635) are capable to bind the 5-HT(1A)-D116A mutant and, using these radioligands, we show here that this mutation dramatically reduces the affinities of the selective 5-HT(1A) agonists N-(3-chloro-4-fluorobenzoyl)-4-fluoro-4-[(5-methylpyridin-2-yl)-methylamino methyl] piperidine (F13640), 3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl-(4-fluorophenyl-4-{[(5-methyl-6 methylamino-pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-amino]-methyl}-piperidin-1-yl-methanone (F13714), and 2-[5-[3-(4-methylsulfonylamino)benzyl-1,4-oxadiazol-5-yl]-1H-indole-3-yl]ethylamine (L694247) and that of 5- carboxamidotryptamine. Although to a lesser extent, the binding of buspirone, (+)-flesinoxan, (-)-pindolol, and (-)-8-OH-DPAT are also highly decreased. In contrast, affinities of the 5- HT 1A ligands WAY100,635, spiperone, (-)-4-(dipropylamino)- 1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz {c, d}indole-6-carboxamide (LY228,729), and 1-[2-( 4- fluorobenzoylamino) ethyl]- 4-(7-methoxynaphtyl) piperazine (S14506) and the prototypical 5-HT(1A) agonist (+)-8-OH-DPAT are only slightly affected by the mutation, suggesting a moderate contribution of Asp116 to the binding pocket for these latter. Furthermore, LY228,729, S14506, and (+)-8-OH-DPAT induce a potent and efficacious coupling of the 5-HT(1A)-D116A receptor to G protein activation as measured by Ca(2+) mobilization and guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate binding in Chinese hamster ovary cells as well as by G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel current activation in Xenopus laevis oocytes. It is interesting that the selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY100,635 shows potent partial agonist activity at the 5-HT(1A)-D116A mutant, whereas spiperone maintains its inverse agonist properties. The pharmacological approach reported here re-evaluates the binding and functional properties of the 5-HT(1A)-D116A receptor and describes for the first time this mutant as a receptor activated solely by synthetic ligands (RASSL), with a rich pharmacology. By bioengineering animal models incorporating this RASSL, one may further explore the role of 5-HT(1A) receptor signaling in the central nervous system as well as G(i) protein-mediated signaling pathways in other tissues.
