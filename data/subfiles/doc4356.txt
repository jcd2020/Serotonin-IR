Harrison-Read, P. E. (2009). "Antimanic potency of typical neuroleptic drugs and affinity for dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors - a new analysis of data from the archives and implications for improved antimanic treatments." Journal of Psychopharmacology 23(8): 899-907.

	Datasets of antimanic potency ratings and receptor-binding affinities [inhibition constants (K(i))] at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A brain receptors were accessed from published literature for a large series (n = 24) of typical neuroleptic drugs, many of which are now obsolete and unobtainable. There was a strong positive association between antimanic potency and affinity for D2 receptors, in support of a 'dopamine-blockade hypothesis' of antimanic drug action. Taking the series of neuroleptics as a whole, there was no association between antimanic potency and affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. Despite this, within a subsample of typical neuroleptics with low affinity for D2 receptors resembling new generation atypical antipsychotics, a positive association between antimanic potency and affinity for 5-HT2A receptors emerged. This suggests that blockade of brain 5-HT2A receptors plays at least a subsidiary role in the antimanic effects of some typical neuroleptics. Other considerations also suggest that combining drugs to achieve high affinity for and blockade of both dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, possibly with additional direct or indirect stimulation of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, might maximize antimanic efficacy.
