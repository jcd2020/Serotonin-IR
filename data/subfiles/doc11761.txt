Weissmann, D., et al. (1986). "Evidence for hyperdensity of 5HT1B binding sites in the substantia nigra of the rat after 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine intraventricular injection." Neurochem Int 9(1): 191-200.

	High affinity serotonin (5HT) binding sites have been found highly concentrated in the substantia nigra (SN) of the rat brain in each classical anatomical subdivisions of this structure, SN reticulata (SNR), SN lateralis (SNL), SN compacta (SNC). In all of the anatomical samples examined along the posteroanterior brain axis (at 200 um intervals), they corresponded to 5HT1B binding sites. The analysis of their distribution performed in rats 15 days after 5,7-DHT intraventricular injection has revealed : (1) the post-synaptic localization of these 5HT1B sites ; (2) the selective increase in their density at the level of SNR. This increase was found heterogeneously distributed inside the SNR and clearly differentiated in external and internal portions of this structure. This hyperdensity in 5HT1B sites in the SNR likely explains the functional hypersensitivity previously demonstrated by local injection of exogenous 5HT into the SN and systemic administration of RU 24969, a preferential 5HT1B agonist.
