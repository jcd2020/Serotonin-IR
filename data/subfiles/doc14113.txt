Zhelyazkova-Savova, M., et al. (1997). "Increase of cortical acetylcholine release after systemic administration of chlorophenylpiperazine in the rat: an in vivo microdialysis study." Neurosci Lett 236(3): 151-154.

	The changes in acetylcholine (ACh) release from the cortex of freely moving rats after systemic administration of chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a 5-HT2C agonist, were measured utilising microdialysis coupled to high performance liquid chromatography. mCPP administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) increased cortical ACh release, but failed to do so when applied locally in the cortex. The effect of i.p. administered mCPP on cortical ACh release was prevented by i.p. injection of mesulergine, a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, and isoteoline, a compound previously shown to antagonize behavioural effects of mCPP. An increase of cortical ACh release was also found after the local administration of mCPP in nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM). The results of the present work suggest that 5-HT2C receptors located in NBM are involved in the modulation of cortical ACh release in the rat.
