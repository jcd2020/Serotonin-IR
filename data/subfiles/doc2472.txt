	The main objective of the current study was to determine the sensitivity of the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]P943 to fenfluramine-induced changes in endogenous 5-HT in nonhuman primate brain. Fenfluramine-induced changes in 5-HT1B occupancy were compared to those obtained by self-block with unlabeled P943. Two baboons and 1 rhesus monkey were given preblocking or displacing doses of fenfluramine (1-5 mg/kg) or preblocking doses of unlabeled P943 (0.2 mg/kg) and imaged with [C-11]P943 PET. Receptor occupancy by the low dose of fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) in the baboons was 25 and 29% and by the high dose of fenfluramine (5 mg/kg) in the rhesus macaque was 42%. Receptor occupancy by P943 (0.2 mg/kg) was 68 and 86% in the baboons. PET imaging of 5-HT1B receptors with [C-11]P943 may be a useful approach for measuring changes in endogenous 5-HT in the living human brain. Synapse 65:1113-1117, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
