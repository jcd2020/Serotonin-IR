Yeung, L. Y., et al. (2010). SEROTONERGIC RECEPTORS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM - A BRIEF REVIEW. Hauppauge, Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

	This review discusses the location, possible mechanisms, interaction and therapeutic possibilities and possible psychiatric influences of the serotonergic receptors 5-HT1A - 5-HT7. It concludes that, although some of the mechanisms of these receptors are widely accepted, their involvements in diseases and their roles in therapeutics are still elusive. Even with their locations, it was only recently perceived that 5-HTIA and 5-HT2A had different localizations in the brainstem, thus making functional correlations possible in due course. In order that a clearer picture or these receptors can emerge, further studies are much needed.
