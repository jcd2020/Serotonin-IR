Lucas, G. and U. Spampinato (2000). "Role of striatal serotonin(2A) and serotonin(2C) receptor subtypes in the control of in vivo dopamine outflow in the rat striatum." Journal of Neurochemistry 74(2): 693-701.

	This study investigated, using in vivo microdialysis in the striatum of freely moving rats, the role of striatal serotonin(2A) (5-HT2A) and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes in the modulation of dopamine (DA) and 3, 4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) outflow, both in basal conditions and under activation induced by subcutaneous administration of 0.01 mg/kg haloperidol. The different 5-HT2 agents used were applied intrastriatally at a 1 mu M concentration through the microdialysis probe. Basal DA efflux was enhanced (27%) by the 5-HT2A/2B/2C agonist 1-(4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-D-2-aminopropane (DOI) and reduced (-30%) by the 5-HT2B/2C antagonist SB 206553. It was unaffected by infusion of the 5-HT2A antagonist SR 46349B. The effect of DOI was abolished by SE 206553 but not modified by SR 46349B. Haloperidol-stimulated DA efflux (65-70%) was reduced by both SR 46349B (-32%) and the 5-HT2A/2B/2C antagonist ritanserin (-30%) but not affected by SE 206553. Conversely, the effect of haloperidol was potentiated (22%) when DOI was coperfused with SE 206553. Also, haloperidol-stimulated DOPAC outflow (40-45%) was reduced (-20%) by SR 46349B and potentiated (25%) by the combination of SE 206553 with DOI. These results indicate that striatal 5-HT2A receptors, probably through activation of DA synthesis, positively modulate DA outflow only under activated conditions. In contrast, striatal 5-HT2C receptors exert a facilitatory control on basal DA efflux, which appears to be both tonic and phasic.
