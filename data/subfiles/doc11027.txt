Thompson, A. M. and A. F. Wiechmann (2002). "5-HT(1A) receptor subtype mRNA expression in cochlear nucleus." Hear Res 164(1-2): 77-81.

	Previous studies indicate expression of various serotonin receptor subtypes, including the 5-HT(1A) receptor subtype, in rodent cochlear nucleus. Our long-term goal is to identify the types of cochlear nucleus neurons, which are well described in cat, that express 5-HT receptors. In the current study, the reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction and the in situ hybridization method were used to detect the mRNA encoding a portion of the 5-HT(1A) receptor subtype in the cochlear nucleus of the cat.
