	The 5-HT6R has been considered as an attractive therapeutic target in the brain due to its exclusive expression in the brain. However, the mechanistic linkage between 5-HT(6)Rs and brain functions remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the effects of 5-HT6R-mediated cell morphological changes using immunocytochemistry, Western blot, and live-cell imaging assays. Our results showed that the activation of 5-HT(6)Rs caused morphological changes and increased cell surface area in HEK293 cells expressing 5-HT(6)Rs. Treatment with 5-HT specifically increased RhoA-GTP activity without affecting other Rho family proteins, such as Rac1 and Cdc42. Furthermore, live-cell imaging in hippocampal neurons revealed that activation of 5-HT(6)Rs using a selective agonist, ST1936, increased the density and size of dendritic protrusions along with the activation of RhoA-GTP activity and that both effects were blocked by pretreatment with a selective 5-HT6R antagonist, SB258585. Taken together, our results show that 5-HT6R plays an important role in the regulation of cell morphology via a RhoA-dependent pathway in mammalian cell lines and primary neurons.
