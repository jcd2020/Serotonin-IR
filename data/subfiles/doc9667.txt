Oishi, R., et al. (1992). "Inhibition of histamine turnover by 8-OH-DPAT, buspirone and 5-hydroxytryptophan in the mouse and rat brain." Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 345(5): 495-499.

	The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonists on histamine turnover in mouse and rat brains were examined. The histamine turnover rate was estimated from the accumulation of tele-methylhistamine 90 min after i.p. injection of pargyline (65 mg/kg). In whole mouse brains, the histamine turnover was significantly inhibited by the 5-HT1A agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (greater than 0.5 mg/kg) and buspirone (greater than 2 mg/kg) injected s.c. 10 min before pargyline treatment. 5-hydroxytryptophan (20 mg/kg) also significantly inhibited histamine turnover. Injections of the 5-HT1B agonist m-trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (10 and 20 mg/kg) or the 5-HT2 agonist (1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (1, 2 and 5 mg/kg), however, did not affect histamine turnover. The inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) on histamine turnover was significantly antagonized (by 40%) by pindolol (20 mg/kg) and slightly antagonized (by 29%) by spiperone (10 mg/kg), while methysergide (20 mg/kg) and ketanserin (10 mg/kg) demonstrated no antagonistic effects. 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 and 1 mg/kg) also showed an inhibiting effect on histamine turnover in various regions of rat brains. Although the extent of inhibition was slightly larger in the striatum and cerebral cortex, there was no marked regional difference. These results suggest that histaminergic activity in the brain is regulated by 5-HT1A receptors.
