	We propose a translational approach to the study of anorexia nervosa (AN) based on our human subject studies where there are characteristic elevations in 5-HT1A receptor binding, associated harm avoidance behaviors, reduced impulsivity, and comorbid anxiety disorders. Towards this goal, the hyponeophagia assay was implemented whereby food-deprived mice show increased latency to begin feeding in a novel, anxiogenic environment. The non-selective serotonin agonist, 5-MeODMT, potentiates feeding inhibition compared to the inhibition generated by the anxiogenic environment in a drug-by-environment interaction. Thus, using hyponeophagia in mice, it was possible to study the following key components of AN: anxiety; feeding inhibition; and a modulatory role of the serotonergic system. A major prediction of the proposed AN model is that 5-HT1A receptor activation is necessary for feeding inhibition. In support of this model. the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY100635, reverses the 5-MeODMT-dependent potentiation of feeding inhibition. Our findings hint at a mechanistic role for increased 5-HT1A receptor activation in restricting-type AN. Further implications for the interplay between anxiety and feeding inhibition in AN are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
