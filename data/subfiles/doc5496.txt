	The dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) is the origin of much of the 5-HT innervation of the forebrain. The activity of DRN 5-HT neurons is regulated by a number of receptors including GABA(A) and 5-HT1A inhibitory receptors and by excitatory alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Using in vitro electrophysiological recording we investigated the action of progesterone and its metabolite, allopregnanolone on receptor-mediated responses of DRN 5-HT neurons. Neither allopregnanolone nor progesterone affected the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor agonist-induced firing. Allopregnanolone also had no effect on the inhibitory response to 5-HT. However, allopregnanolone significantly potentiated the inhibitory responses to GABA(A) receptor agonists. Progesterone did not enhance GABA(A) receptor-meditated inhibitory responses. Thus, the neuroactive metabolite of progesterone, allopregnanolone, has the ability to cause potentiation of GABA(A)-mediated inhibition of DRN 5-HT neurons. This effect on 5-HT neurotransmission may have relevance for mood disorders commonly associated with reproductive hormone events, such as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and postpartum depression.
