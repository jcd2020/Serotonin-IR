	We report the long-term modulation of K+ channels by cAMP in cultured murine colliculi neurons. A short (1-2 s) application of 8-Br-cAMP induced a long-lasting broadening of the action potential, a loss of after-hyperpolarization, and a reduction in spike accommodation. In agreement with these changes, 8-Br-cAMP produced a long-lasting (2 hr) inhibition of a K+ current. These effects were also observed after a short activation of the pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide, beta-adrenergic, and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 (5-HT4) receptors, all known to increase cAMP. A transient activation of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and a long-lasting inhibition of phosphatases (up to 2 hr) were detected. The blockade of the K+ current resulting from a brief application of 8-Br-cAMP or 5-hydroxytryptamine was prolonged from 2 to 4 hr when protein-serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2A were inhibited with 10 nM okadaic acid. The critical steps following the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activation and resulting in a long-term blockade of phosphatases are discussed in this report.
