Fan, P. (1994). "Antagonism by forskolin of the 5-HT3 receptor-mediated current in nodose ganglion neurons is independent of cyclic AMP." Brain Res 650(1): 16-19.

	The effect of forskolin on the inward current mediated by 5-HT3 receptors (5-HT current) was investigated in rat nodose ganglion neurons. Forskolin inhibited the peak amplitude of the 5-HT current and increased current desensitization in a dose-dependent manner. Dideoxyforskolin, which does not stimulate adenylate cyclase, had a similar inhibitory effect on the 5-HT current. The effect of forskolin was neither mimicked by intracellular application of exogenous cyclic AMP (0.5 to 4 mM) nor occluded by intracellular forskolin (30 microM) or protein kinase inhibitor H-7 (100 microM). Intracellular applications of forskolin, cyclic AMP or H-7 had no effect on 5-HT current. Data suggest that forskolin acted at an extracellular site on 5-HT3 receptors and this effect of forskolin was not mediated by cyclic AMP-dependent processes.
