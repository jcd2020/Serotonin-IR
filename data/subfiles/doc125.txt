	Interplay between migraine and balance disorder morbidities has been a topic of interest for many years. Serotonin (5-HT) receptor is closely related with migraine and is associated with vestibular symptoms. The mechanism underlying migrainous vertigo, however, has not been determined. 5-HT1F receptor has recently attracted attention in the treatment of migraine, and the release of glutamate from trigeminal neurons has been implicated in migraine. In this study, the authors observed the colocalization of 5-HT1F receptor and glutamate in the vestibular nuclei of rats using double immunofluorescence, which suggests that 5-HT1F receptor might modulate glutamate release from the vestibular nuclei. The results of this study suggest that 5-HT1F receptor agonists represent a potential therapeutic strategy for migraine and balance disorders by blocking the release of glutamate.
