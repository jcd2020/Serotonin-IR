Hui, Y. P., et al. (2015). "Anxiolytic effects of prelimbic 5-HT(1A) receptor activation in the hemiparkinsonian rat." Behav Brain Res 277: 211-220.

	This study sought to assess whether unilateral lesions of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) using 6-hydroxydopamine in rats are able to induce anxiety-like behaviors, the role of serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptors of the prelimbic (PrL) sub-region of ventral medial prefrontal cortex in the regulation of these behaviors, the density of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and co-localization of 5-HT1A receptor and neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1-immunoreactive (EAAC1-ir) cells in the PrL. Unilaterally lesioning the MFB induced anxiety-like behaviors as measured by the open-field and elevated plus maze tests when compared to sham-operated rats. Intra-PrL injection of 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (50, 100, and 500 ng/rat) decreased the percentage of time spent in the center of the open-field and percentages of open arm entries and open arm time in sham-operated rats, indicating the induction of anxiogenic responses, and administration of 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (60, 120, and 240 ng/rat) showed anxiolytic effects. However, 8-OH-DPAT, at the same doses, increased the percentage of time spent in the center of the open-field and percentages of open arm entries and open arm time in the lesioned rats, indicating the induction of anxiolytic effects, and WAY-100635 produced anxiogenic responses. Unilateral MFB lesion decreased the density of 5-HT neurons in the DRN, and percentage of EAAC1-ir cells expressing 5-HT1A receptors in the PrL. These results suggest that unilateral lesions of the MFB in rats may induce anxiety-like behaviors, and activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the PrL has anxiolytic effects in the rat model of Parkinson's disease.
