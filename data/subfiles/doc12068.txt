Stachowicz, K., et al. (2007). "Anxiolytic-like action of MTEP expressed in the conflict drinking Vogel test in rats is serotonin dependent." Neuropharmacology 53(6): 741-748.

	The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the anxiolytic-like action of a selective and brain penetrable group I metabotropic glutamate (mGlu5) receptor antagonist 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-tiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]-pyridine (MTEP) is dependent upon the serotonergic system. Experiments were performed on male Wistar rats. The Vogel conflict drinking test was used to detect anxiolytic-like activity. MTEP administered intraperitoneally at doses of 1, 3 and 6 mg/kg induced anxiolytic-like effect. The potential anxiolytic effect of MTEP (1 mg/kg) was inhibited by a nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline (2 mg/kg i.p.) and 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist ritanserin (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), but not by a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridynyl)cyclohexane-carboxa mide (WAY 100635) (0.1 mg/kg i.p). The anxiolytic effect of MTEP (6 mg/kg) was attenuated by ritanserin (1 mg/kg i.p.). Moreover, MTEP-induced a dose-dependent release of serotonin in the frontal cortex. The obtained results suggest that the potential anxiolytic effect of the mGlu5 receptor antagonist MTEP is due to the increased serotonin release with subsequent activation of 5-HT2A/2C receptors, most probably located postsynaptically, but not by the 5-HT1A receptors.
