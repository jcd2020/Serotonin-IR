	Tourette syndrome (TS) is characterized by one of the chronic neuropsychiatric disorders in multiple children, and the pathogenesis of Tourette syndrome (TS) has not been previously elucidated.The aim of this study was designed to investigate the effects of rhynchophylline (RH) on Tourette syndrome (TS) in rats.TS model was established in rats and BV2 cells by the selective 5-HT2A/2C agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI). Behavior evaluations including stereotypy recording and autonomic activity test were performed. Inflammatory cytokine levels such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in serum, striatum, and cell supernatant were detected. The expression levels of BDNF/NF-κB pathway in striatum and BV2 cells were measured by Western blot. Dopamine (DA) and dopamine receptor D 2 (D2) in striatum were also measured.Data indicated that RH significantly decreased IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum, striatum, and cell supernatant of TS model, with altered expression of P-NF-κBp65, P-IκBα, and BDNF in TS rats, and DOI-induced BV2 cells, as evidenced by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry analysis. RH also significantly reduced the levels of DA and D2 in striatum.Our results shown that the regulation of BDNF/NF-κB pathway might be involved in the effects of RH on TS model.
