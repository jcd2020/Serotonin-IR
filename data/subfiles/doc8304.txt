McClure-Begley, T. D., et al. (2012). "A novel alpha-conotoxin MII-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptor modulates [(3) H]-GABA release in the superficial layers of the mouse superior colliculus." J Neurochem 122(1): 48-57.

	Mouse superficial superior colliculus (SuSC) contains dense GABAergic innervation and diverse nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to investigate the subunit compositions of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) expressed on mouse SuSC GABAergic terminals. [(125) I]-Epibatidine competition-binding studies revealed that the alpha3beta2* and alpha6beta2* nicotinic subtype-selective peptide alpha-conotoxin MII-blocked binding to 40 +/- 5% of SuSC nAChRs. Acetylcholine-evoked [(3) H]-GABA release from SuSC crude synaptosomal preparations is calcium dependent, blocked by the voltage-sensitive calcium channel blocker, cadmium, and the nAChR antagonist mecamylamine, but is unaffected by muscarinic, glutamatergic, P2X and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Approximately 50% of nAChR-mediated SuSC [(3) H]-GABA release is inhibited by alpha-conotoxin MII. However, the highly alpha6beta2*-subtype-selective alpha-conotoxin PIA did not affect [(3) H]-GABA release. Nicotinic subunit-null mutant mouse experiments revealed that ACh-stimulated SuSC [(3) H]-GABA release is entirely beta2 subunit-dependent. alpha4 subunit deletion decreased total function by >90%, and eliminated alpha-conotoxin MII-resistant release. ACh-stimulated SuSC [(3) H]-GABA release was unaffected by beta3, alpha5 or alpha6 nicotinic subunit deletions. Together, these data suggest that a significant proportion of mouse SuSC nicotinic agonist-evoked GABA-release is mediated by a novel, alpha-conotoxin MII-sensitive alpha3alpha4beta2 nAChR. The remaining alpha-conotoxin MII-resistant, nAChR agonist-evoked SuSC GABA release appears to be mediated via alpha4beta2* subtype nAChRs.
