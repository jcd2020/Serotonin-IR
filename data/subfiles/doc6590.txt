Lopez-Gimenez, J. F., et al. (2001). "Multiple conformations of native and recombinant human 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) receptors are labeled by agonists and discriminated by antagonists." Molecular Pharmacology 60(4): 690-699.

	We have expanded previous studies with the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2) receptor agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-[I-125]iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane [(+/-)-[I-125]DOI] in human brain that had shown biphasic competition curves for several 5-HT2A receptor antagonists by using new selective antagonists of 5-HT2A (MDL100,907) and 5-HT2C (SB242084) receptors together with ketanserin and mesulergine. Autoradiographic competition experiments were performed with these antagonists in human brain regions where (+/-)-[I-125]DOI labels almost exclusively 5-HT2A receptors (frontal cortex and striosomes). Furthermore, the effect of uncoupling receptor/G protein complexes on antagonist competition was studied with guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma -imido)triphosphate [Gpp(NH)p]. Competition experiments with (+/-)-[H-3]1-(4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenil)-2-aminopropane [(+/-)-[H-3]DOB] were also performed in membranes from Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOFA4) expressing cloned human 5-HT2A receptors. In both systems, ketanserin and MDL100,907 displayed biphasic competition profiles, whereas SB242084 and mesulergine competed monophasically. In absence of antagonist, 100 muM Gpp(NH)p decreased brain (+/-)-[I-125]DOI specific binding by 40 to 50% and (+/-)-[H-3]DOB specific binding to CHOFA4 cells by 30%. The remaining agonist-labeled uncoupled sites were still displaced biphasically by ketanserin and MDL100,907, with unaltered affinities. Saturation experiments were performed in CHOFA4 cells. (+/-)-[H-3]DOB labeled two sites (K-dh = 0.8 nM, K-dl = 31.22 nM). Addition of 100 muM Gpp(NH)p resulted in a single low-affinity (K-d = 24.44 nM) site with unchanged B-max. [H-3]5-HT showed no specific binding to 5-HT2A receptors. These results conform with the extended ternary complex model of receptor action that postulates the existence of partly activated receptor conformation(s) (R*) in equilibrium with the ground (R) and the activated G protein-coupled (R*G) conformations. Thus, both in human brain and CHOFA4 cells, the agonists possibly label all three conformations and ketanserin and MDL100,907 recognize with different affinities at least two of these conformations.
