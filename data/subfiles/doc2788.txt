	5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) or serotonin 2A receptors play an important role in modulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity and have been implicated in the physiopathology of psychiatric disorders. There is no quantitative information on the percentage of glutamatergic and GABAergic cells that express 5-HT(2A) receptors in human and monkey PFC. We have used double in situ hybridization to quantify the mRNA co-localization of 5-HT(2A) receptor with the glutamatergic transporter vesicular glutamate transporter 1, and with the GABAergic marker glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 and in parvalbumin and calbindin GABAergic cell populations. Our results show that nearly every glutamatergic cell (86-100%) in layers II-V expressed 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA in both species. This percentage was lower in layer VI (13-31%). In contrast, not all the GABAergic interneurons (13-46%) expressed 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA. This receptor was expressed in 45-69% of parvalbumin and in 61-87% of calbindin positive cells. These results indicate that, while the majority of glutamatergic neurons can be sensitive to 5-HT action via 5-HT(2A) receptors, this modulation occurs only in a limited population of GABAergic interneurons and provides new neuroanatomical information about the role played by serotonin through 5-HT(2A) receptors in the PFC and on the sites of action for drugs such as antipsychotics and antidepressants used in treatment of psychiatric disorders.
