Andres, J. I., et al. (2002). "Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of 2-(aminoalkyl)2,3,3a,8-tetrahydrodibenzo c,f isoxazolo 2,3-a azepine derivatives: A novel series of 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonists. Part 2." Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry Letters 12(2): 249-253.

	Following the programme started at Janssen Research Foundation searching for 5-HT2A/2C antagonists, we now report on the synthesis of a series of substituted 2-(Dimethylaminomethyl)-2,3,3a,8-tetrahydrodibenzo [c,f]jllsoxazoio[2,3-a]azepine derivatives. The 5-HT2A, 5-HT(2)c and H-1 receptor affinities as well as the mCPP antagonistic activity of the compounds synthesised is described. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.
