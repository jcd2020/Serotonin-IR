	Buspirone presents a unique profile of action, which involves activation of 5-HT(1A) receptors and complex effects on D(2)-like dopaminergic receptors. This medication is studied in terms of potential clinical repositioning to conditions that are associated with dopaminergic dysfunctions including schizophrenia and substance use disorder. Buspirone antagonizes D(3) and D(4) receptors, however, depending on the dose it differentially interacts with D(2) receptors. Previously, we reported that some of D(2)/D(3) dopaminergic agonists attenuate PTSD-like behavioral symptoms in mice. Here we investigated whether buspirone could also affect PTSD-like symptoms. We used the single prolonged stress (mSPS) protocol to induce PTSD-like behavior in adult male CD-1 mice. Buspirone (0.5, 2, or 10 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected for 15 consecutive days. The subjects were repeatedly examined in a variety of behavioral tests measuring conditioned freezing response, antidepressant-like effects, anxiety, and ultrasonic vocal response to the restraint stress. Mouse SPS resulted in prolonged immobility in the forced swim test and freezing in the fear-conditioning test, and produced symptoms of anxiety. Buspirone dose-dependently decreased the exaggerated freezing response in mice, but only at the dose of 2 mg/kg exhibited the anxiolytic-like effect in the elevated plus maze test. Buspirone reduced the number of ultrasonic calls in mSPS-exposed mice but revealed no antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test. Present data suggest some positive effects of buspirone in the treatment of selected PTSD-like symptoms and prompt for its further clinical evaluation.
