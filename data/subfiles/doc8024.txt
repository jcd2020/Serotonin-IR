	Schedule-induced polydipsia (SIP) is an established model for studying compulsive behaviour in rats. Serotoninergic drugs effectively reduce compulsive drinking on SIP, and high compulsive drinker rats selected by SIP have shown differences in serotoninergic brain activity. However, the specific serotoninergic receptors that modulate compulsive SIP remain unclear. We investigated the functional role of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A or C (5-HT2A/C) receptors in compulsive SIP behaviour. Rats were selected for low (LD) versus high drinking (HD) behaviour on SIP. The effects of the systemic administration of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine, serotonin 5-HT2A/C receptor agonist DOI hydrochloride ((+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine), serotonin 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB242084, serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin and M100907 were assessed on SIP. Subsequently, the effects of DOI were tested after the pre-administration of SB242084, ketanserin and M100907 on SIP. Citalopram and DOI reduced compulsive drinking in HD compared with LD rats on SIP. In contrast, SB242084 increased compulsive drinking in HD compared with LD rats on SIP. Atomoxetine, ketanserin and M100907 had no effect on SIP. The reduction in water intake produced by DOI was blocked by ketanserin and M100907, but not by SB242084 administration, in HD rats. These findings highlight the contribution of serotoninergic 5-HT2A/C receptors compared with noradrenergic mechanisms on SIP and reveal the "therapeutic" activation of serotonin 5-HT2A in the inhibition of the compulsive drinking behaviour in HD rats. Thus, it may represent a potentially new marker of vulnerability and provides additional insight for potential treatments on compulsive behaviours in neuropsychiatric populations.
