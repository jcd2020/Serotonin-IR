	Serotonin (5-HT) has direct and specific effects on the activity of spinal cord motoneurons. The 5-HT1A receptor has been shown to mediate motoneuron responses in spinal reflex pathways using the highly selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. We have developed an antipeptide antibody that recognizes a specific region (the second external loop) of the 5-HT1A receptor. This 5-HT1A receptor antibody labels populations of neurons and glia in the primate cervical spinal cord. The highest receptor density is present in the superficial lamina of the dorsal horn, around the central canal, and on the axon hillock of large ventral horn motoneurons. The cellular labeling pattern on motoneurons shows a single, densely stained, tapering process emanating from the perikaryon. A more diffuse label is also present throughout the soma. Dendritic labeling was not apparent. These results suggest that post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors may be involved in modulating spinal motoneuron activity at the key site of action potential initiation, the axon hillock.
