	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A strategy to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to increase the soluble form of amyloid precursor protein (sAPPalpha), a promnesic protein, in the brain. Because strong evidence supports beneficial effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT(4) receptor agonists in memory and learning, we investigated the role of 5-HT(4) receptors on APP processing in 8 weeks-old male C57BL/6j mice. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Mice were given, subcutaneously, prucalopride or ML 10302 (s.c.), two highly selective 5-HT(4) receptor agonists and, up to 240 min later, the hippocampus and cortex were analysed by Western blot for sAPPalpha determination. KEY RESULTS: Prucalopride (5 or 10 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased sAPPalpha levels in the hippocampus and cortex, but did not modify the expression level of APP mRNA as detected by quantitative RT-PCR. A selective 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist, GR125487 (1 mg kg(-1), s.c.) inhibited prucalopride induced- increase in sAPPalpha levels. In addition, levels of sAPPalpha were increased by ML10302 only at 20 mg kg(-1) and was limited to the cortex. Also, prucalopride increased sAPPalpha levels in the cortex of a transgenic mouse model of AD, expressing the London mutation of APP. Furthermore, the combined injection of a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil and prucalopride induced a synergic increase in sAPPalpha levels in the cortex and hippocampus. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results demonstrate that the 5-HT(4) receptor plays a key role in the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism in vivo and give support to the beneficial use of 5-HT(4) agonists for AD treatment.
