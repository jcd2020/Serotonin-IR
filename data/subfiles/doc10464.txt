	In the present study, serotonin 2C (5-HT(2C)) receptor binding parameters in the brainstem and cerebral cortex were investigated during liver generation after partial hepatectomy (PH) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) induced hepatic neoplasia in male Wistar rats. The serotonin content increased significantly (p<0.01) in the cerebral cortex after PH and in NDEA induced hepatic neoplasia. Brain stem serotonin content increased significantly (p<0.05) after PH and (p<0.001) in NDEA induced hepatic neoplasia. The number and affinity of the 5-HT(2C) receptors in the crude synaptic membrane preparations of the brain stem showed a significant (p<0.001) increase after PH and in NDEA induced hepatic neoplasia. The number and affinity of 5-HT(2C) receptors increased significantly (p<0.001) in NDEA induced hepatic neoplasia in the crude synaptic membrane preparations of the cerebral cortex. There was a significant (p<0.01) increase in plasma norepinephrine in PH and (p<0.001) in NDEA induced hepatic neoplasia, indicating sympathetic stimulation. Thus, our results suggest that during active hepatocyte proliferation 5-HT(2C) receptor in the brain stem and cerebral cortex are up-regulated which in turn induce hepatocyte proliferation mediated through sympathetic stimulation.
