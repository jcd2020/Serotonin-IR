	The prefrontal cortex is involved in an array of higher brain functions that are altered in psychiatric disorders. Serotonergic neurons of the midbrain rapbe nuclei innervate the prefrontal cortex and are the cellular target for drugs used to treat mood disorders such as the selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors. Anatomical evidence supports the existence of projections from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR). We report on a functional control of the activity of DR 5-HT neurons by projection neurons in the mPFC. The stimulation of the mPFC elicits two types of responses in DR 5-HT neurons, orthodromic excitations and inhibitions. Excitations are mediated by AMPA/KA and NMDA receptors whereas inhibitions are mediated by GABA(A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors. The activation of a subgroup of 5-HT neurons increases 5-HT release which subsequently activates 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors on other 5-HT neurons. GABA(A)-mediated inhibitions involve GABAergic elements in the DR or adjacent areas. Pyramidal neurons of the mPFC co-express postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) (inhibitory) and 5-HT(2A) (excitatory) receptors. Consistent with the above observations, the selective activation of both receptors in mPFC reduced and increased, respectively, the firing activity of DR 5-HT neurons and the 5-HT release in mPFC. Overall, these data indicate that the activity of the 5-HT system is strongly controlled by the mPFC. Thus, the abnormal prefrontal function in post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive patients may induce a disregulation of 5-HT neurons projecting to other brain areas that can underlie the existing symptomatology in these psychiatric disorders.
