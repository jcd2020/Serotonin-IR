Sapena, R., et al. (1994). "CYCLIC-AMP AND INOSITOL PHOSPHATE ACCUMULATIONS IN RAT-BRAIN CORTICAL SLICES FOLLOWING CHRONIC CITALOPRAM OR DESIPRAMINE ADMINISTRATION." Drugs under Experimental and Clinical Research 20(3): 93-102.

	The influence of chronic administration of desipramine (16mg/kg per day for 8 days) or citalopram (1 mg/kg per day for 8 days) on the serotonergic and noradrenergic stimulations of phosphoinositide hydrolysis and cyclic AMP formation was investigated in rat cerebral cortical slices. This was done by means of a prelabelling method allowing the simultaneous measurement of the accumulations of (H-3) inositol phosphates ((H-3)IP) and of (C-14) cyclic AMP. Our results show that neither oi the two drugs altered the inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity induced by serotonin(1) (5-HT1) receptor agonists nor did they alter 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor densities. Similarly they did not modify the stimulation oi the inositol phosphate metabolism induced by 5-HT or norepinephrine (NE). Desipramine treatment decreased both beta-adrenoceptor-elicited cyclic AMP accumulation (-37%) and beta-adrenoceptor density (-29%), whereas citalopram was without effect, These results reinforce the idea that the ability of antidepressants to decrease the activity of the beta-adrenoceptor-adenylate cyclase complex is not common to ail antidepressants, and provide no evidence for the involvement of 5-HT1A and/or 5-HT1B in the mechanism of action oi these drugs.
