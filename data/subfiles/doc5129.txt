Hedberg, M. H., et al. (1996). "11-substituted (R)-aporphines: Synthesis, pharmacology, and modeling of D-2A and 5-HT1A receptor interactions." J Med Chem 39(18): 3503-3513.

	A series of C11-substituted (R)-aporphines and C11-oxygenated (R)-noraporphines has been synthesized and evaluated for central serotonergic and dopaminergic effects in vitro and in vivo. The various C11-substituents were introduced using efficient nickel- and palladium-catalyzed reactions of the corresponding triflate (R)-11-[[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]oxy] aporphine (6), Several compounds display high affinity to serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in spite of major differences in steric bulk and electronic properties of the various C11-substituents. A change of the N-methyl group of the nonselective 3 to H [23, (R)-11-hydroxynoraporphine] or propyl [2, (R)-11-hydroxy-N-propylnoraporphine] increases the selectivity for 5-HT1A receptors (100-fold) and dopamine D-2A receptors (3-fold), respectively. Compounds 3 and 23 have similar affinities to 5-HT1A receptors, whereas the propyl substituent of 2 not only enhances the selectivity for D-2A receptors but also increases the D-2A affinity. Modeling of ligand-receptor binding site interactions yielded an interaction site model for the 5-HT1A receptor that describes a gradual change in binding mode for C11-hydroxy, -methoxy-, and -phenyl-substituted derivatives. Hydrogen bonding is hereby gradually replaced by van der Waals interactions involving a relatively large lipophilic pocket. The derived D-2A receptor model can accommodate both the N-propyl substituent of 2 and the C11-ethyl substituent of 11 [(R)-11-ethylaporphine].
