	Proceeding investigations of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) heterocomplexes have demonstrated that the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), one of the hub receptors in the physiology of schizophrenia, interacts with both the neurotensin NTS1 (NTS1R) and the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) in cell lines and rodent brain tissue. In situ proximity ligation assay and BRET-based saturation experiments confirmed interacting receptor assemblies in HEK293T and neuronal HT22 cells. The NTS1R agonist NT(8-13) reduces the Gaq-mediated calcium signal in the NTS1R-D2R complex compared to the NTS1R monomer which could be reversed by D2R antagonists. The bivalent ligand CS148 (NTS1R-agonistic, D2R-antagonistic) increased the calcium response addressing the dimer, consistent with the effect of the monovalent ligands suggesting an allosteric D2R-mediated modulation. In contrast, the 5-HT2AR-D2R heteromer did not show a calcium-altering receptor-receptor interaction. Despite their common coupling-preference for Gaq, 5-HT2AR and NTS1R supposedly interact with D2R each in a unique mode. This remarkably diverse ligand-mediated signalling in two different D2R heteroreceptor complexes illustrates the complexity of receptor-receptor interactions and their potential of modifying cell responses to external stimuli. Therefore, GPCR heteromers may provide a very promising novel target for the therapy of neuropsychiatric disorders.
