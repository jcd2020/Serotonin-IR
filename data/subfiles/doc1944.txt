Chojnackawojcik, E., et al. (1991). "INVOLVEMENT OF 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN THE ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE ACTIVITY OF GEPIRONE IN THE FORCED SWIMMING TEST IN RATS." Neuropharmacology 30(7): 711-717.

	The antidepressant-like activity of gepirone, a drug with a high and selective affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptors, was studied in the forced swimming test in rats. The drug, administered intraperitoneally in single doses of 2.5-20 mg/kg, potently and dose-dependently shortened the immobility time. The anti-immobility effect of gepirone (10 mg/kg) was dose-dependently antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor and alpha-1-adrenoceptor antagonist, NAN-190 (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg), the beta-adrenoceptor blocker with the affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, pindolol (2 and 4 mg/kg), the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and dopamine receptor blocker spiperone (0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg) and by the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol (0.125 and 0.25 mg/kg). On the other hand, the non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist, metergoline (2 and 4 mg/kg), the selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (1 and 2 mg/kg), the selective alpha-1-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) and the beta-blockers with no affinity for 5-HT receptors, betaxolol (4 and 8 mg/kg) and ICI 118,551 (4 and 8 mg/kg), did not affect the anti-immobility effect of gepirone. The effect of gepirone was not modified, either, in animals with a lesion of the 5-HT system, produced by p-chloroamphetamine (PCA, 2 x 10 mg/kg) or p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA, 3 x 300 mg/kg). The results obtained suggest that the anti-immobility effect of gepirone is mediated by activation of 5-HT1A receptors, most probably located postsynaptically and that dopamine may be involved in this action.
