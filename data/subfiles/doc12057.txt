	Serotonergic neurotransmission in prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a key role in regulating emotion and cognition under normal and pathological conditios. Increasing evidence suggests that serotonin receptors are involved in the complex regulation of GABAergic inhibitory transmission in PFC. Activation of postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors in PFC pyramidal neurons inhibits GABAA-receptor currents via phosphorylation of GABAA receptor gamma2 subunits by RACK1-anchored PKC. In contrast, activation of postsynaptic 5-HT4 receptors produces an activity-dependent bi-directional regulation of GABA-evoked currents in PFC pyramidal neurons, which is mediated through phosphorylation of GABAA-receptor beta subunits by anchored PKA. On the presynaptic side, GABAergic inhibition is regulated by 5-HT through the activation of 5-HT2, 5-HT1, and 5-HT3 receptors on GABAergic intereneurons. These data provide a molecular and cellular mechanism for serotonin to dynamically regulate synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability in the PFC network, which may underlie the actions of many antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs.
