Okugawa, H., et al. (2000). "Effects of sesquiterpenoids from "Oriental incenses" on acetic acid-induced writhing and D-2 and 5-HT2A receptors in rat brain." Phytomedicine 7(5): 417-422.

	Six sesquiterpenoids, namely jinkoh-eremol, agarospirol, alpha- and beta -santalols, dehydrocostus lactone and costunolide, isolated from oriental incenses inhibited acetic acid-induced writhing in mice. The incidence of writhing produced by jinkoh-eremol, alpha -santalol and costunolide were revealed by administration of naloxone (mu-, kappa- and delta -antagonists). Inhibitory activities of alpha -santalol on opioid receptors were shown only by the delta antagonist, but not by the mu- and kappa -antagonists. The delta (2)-antagonist, but not the delta -antagonist, inhibited the activity of alpha santalol. The mechanism of inhibitory activity on the opioid receptor by alpha -santalol was different from that of morphine, alpha -Santalol was shown to be the most potent of the six as an antagonist of dopamine D-2 and serotonine 5-HT2A, receptor binding. The effect of alpha -Santalol, was the same as that of chlorpromazine as an antipsychotic agent, although a-santalol was less potent than chlorpromazine.
