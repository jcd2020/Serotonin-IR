Raje, S., et al. (2008). "A positron emission tomography study to assess binding of lecozotan, a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A silent antagonist, to brain 5-HT1A receptors in healthy young and elderly subjects, and in patients with Alzheimer's disease." Clinical Pharmacology & Therapeutics 83(1): 86-96.

	This positron emission tomography (PET) study was conducted to assess binding of lecozotan, a new potent and silent 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A (5-HT1A) antagonist being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), to 5-HT1A receptors in the human brain using C-11-labeled WAY-100635. Lecozotan was administered as a single dose of 0.5, 1, or 5 mg to young subjects and 5 mg to elderly subjects and AD patients. PET measurements were performed at 3-4 time points over a 25-h period. Mean peak 5-HT1A receptor occupancy (RO) in young subjects (seen at 1 h) was 10%, 18%, and 44% for the three doses, respectively. Mean peak RO was slightly higher in elderly (63%) and AD patients (55%). An E-max pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model adequately described the lecozotan plasma concentration-RO relationship. Steady-state peak RO is predicted to be approximately 70% for 5 mg q12 h (twice-daily). Results demonstrate that lecozotan binds to the human brain 5-HT1A receptors and has a maximum observed RO of 50-60% following a single dose of 5 mg in elderly subjects/AD patients.
