Moran, A., et al. (1998). "Characterization of prejunctional 5-HT1 receptors that mediate the inhibition of pressor effects elicited by sympathetic stimulation in the pithed rat." Br J Pharmacol 123(6): 1205-1213.

	1 A study was made of the effects of 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) on presser responses induced in vivo by electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow from the spinal cord of pithed rats. All animals had been pretreated with atropine. Sympathetic stimulation (0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 Hz) resulted in frequency-dependent increases in blood pressure. Intravenous infusion of 5-CT at doses of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mu g kg(-1) min(-1) reduced the presser effects obtained by electrical stimulation. The inhibitory effect of 5-CT was significantly more pronounced at lower frequencies of stimulation. In the present study we characterized the pharmacological profile of the receptors mediating the above inhibitory effect of 5-CT. 2 The inhibition induced by 0.01 mu g kg(-1) min(-1) of 5-CT on sympathetically-induced presser responses was partially blocked after i.v. treatment with methiothepin (10 mu g kg(-1)), WAY-100,635 (100 mu g kg(-1)) or GR127935T (250 mu g kg(-1)), but was not affected by cyanopindolol (100 mu g kg(-1)). 3 The selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists sumatriptan and L-694,247 inhibited the presser response, whereas the 5-HT1B receptor agonists CGS-12066B and CP-93,129 and the 5-HT2C receptor agonist m-CPP did not modify the presser sympathetic responses. 4 The selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100,635 (100 mu g kg(-1)) blocked the inhibition induced by 8-OH-DPAT and the selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist GR127935T (250 mu g kg(-1)) abolished the inhibition induced either by L-694,247 or sumatriptan. 5 None of the 5-HT receptor agonists used in our experiments modified the presser responses induced by exogenous noradrenaline (NA). 6 These results suggest that the presynaptic inhibitory action of 5-CT on the electrically-induced pressor response is mediated by both r-5-HT1D and 5-HT1A receptors.
