Sugimoto, Y., et al. (1999). "A neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole reduces the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT-elicited hyperphagia in rats." European Journal of Pharmacology 376(1-2): 1-5.

	The effects of the neuronal nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor 7-nitroindazole on 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-(propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)-induced hyperphagia, which is mediated by the 5-HT1A autoreceptor, were investigated in rats. 7-Nitroindazole suppressed 8-OH-DPAT-elicited increases in food intake. The inhibitory effects of 7-nitroindazole on 8-OH-DPAT-induced feeding were prevented by the NO precursor L-arginine. Although 8-OH-DPAT decreases 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis, 7-nitroindazole did not reverse the 8-OH-DPAT-elicited decrease in 5-HT synthesis. Therefore, these results indicate that NO formed in the brain is involved in 8-OH-DPAT-induced hyperphagia and that the hypophagic effects of 7-nitroindazole are not dependent on 5-HT synthesis.
