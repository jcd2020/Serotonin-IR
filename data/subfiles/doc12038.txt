Yamauchi, M., et al. (2006). "[Role of the serotonergic nervous system in anxiety disorders and the anxiolytic mechanism of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]." Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi 26(5-6): 193-198.

	Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have recently been approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder, and they are considered first-line treatment for anxiety disorders in Japan as well as in other countries. Previous clinical studies have suggested that the 5-HT2C receptors in subjects with anxiety disorders are hypersensitive. We recently reported that chronic treatment with fluvoxamine or paroxetine desensitized 5-HT2C receptor function. The desensitization of 5-H T2C receptor function has also been reported with other SSRIs and is considered to be a common mechanism of action of SSRIs in the treatment of anxiety disorders. In addition, some studies have suggested that 5-HT2A receptors and 5-HTIA receptors participate in anxiety disorders and the therapeutic mechanism. Both clinical studies and animal studies have indicated that the amygdala plays an essential role in anxiety and fear response. Thus, it may be important to elucidate functional changes in these 5-HT receptor subtypes in brain regions including the amygdala under the chronic administration of SSRIs to understand the anxiolytic mechanism of SSRIs.
