Sporton, S. C. E., et al. (1991). "MICROINJECTIONS OF 5-HT1A AGONISTS INTO THE DORSAL MOTOR VAGAL NUCLEUS PRODUCE A BRADYCARDIA IN THE ATENOLOL-PRETREATED ANESTHETIZED RAT." Br J Pharmacol 104(2): 466-470.

	1 The effects of microinjections (100 nl) into the dorsal motor vagal nucleus of the 5-HT1A receptor agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and flesinoxan, the 5-HT2 receptor agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), the 5-HT3 receptor agonist phenylbiguanide (PBG), the alpha-2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine and the excitatory amino acid glutamate on heart rate, blood pressure, tracheal pressure and phrenic nerve activity were investigated in atenolol-pretreated rats anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone. 2 Microinjections of glutamate (2.5 nmol) caused decreases in blood pressure, heart rate and phrenic nerve activity. In contrast, microinjections of 5-HT (1.2 nmol), 8-OH-DPAT (1.2 nmol) and flesinoxan (1.3 nmol) all caused a bradycardia but had no effect on blood pressure. In addition, 8-OH-DPAT and flesinoxan caused an increase in phrenic nerve activity. 3 Microinjections of DOI, PBG and clonidine had no significant effect on any of the variables recorded. None of the drugs used had any significant effect on tracheal pressure. 4 These results support the hypothesis that activation of 5-HT1A receptors causes excitation of cardiac vagal motoneurones and suggest that these receptors are also important in the control of central respiratory drive.
