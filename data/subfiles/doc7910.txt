Nagaoka, I., et al. (1998). "5-HT1A receptor mediated inhibition of nucleus accumbens neurons activated by stimulation of parafascicular nucleus of thalamus." Psychopharmacology 135(3): 230-235.

	Electrophysiological studies using chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats were performed to elucidate the role of serotonin(1A) (5-WT1A) receptors in the regulation of neuronal activity of nucleus accumbens (Acc) neurons receiving input from the parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus (Pf). Extracellular neuronal activities were recorded in Ace using a glass microelectrode attached along a seven-barreled micropipette. each barrel of which was filled with dopamine, 5-HT, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT: 5-HT1A agonist) hydrobromide, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]-piperazine (NAN-190: 5-HT1A antagonist) hydrobromide, glutamate and 2 M NaCl. These drugs were microiontophoretically applied to the immediate vicinity of the target neuron. Spikes elicited by Pf stimulation were inhibited by iontophoretically applied dopamine, 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT in a dose-dependent manner. In these neurons, firing induced by iontophoretic application of glutamate was also suppressed by dopamine: 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT. The 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibitions of the glutamate-induced firing were antagonized by concomitant application of NAN-190. These findings suggest that the dopamine-sensitive Ace neurons receiving input from Pf are inhibited by 5-HT via 5-HT1A receptors located on postsynaptic Ace neurons.
