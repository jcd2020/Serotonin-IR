	Perinatal asphyxia is a concern for public health and may promote subtle and long-lasting neuropsychiatric disorders. In the present study, newborn Wistar rat pups underwent a repeated 20-min exposure to a 100% N-2 atmosphere (or air) on postnatal days (pnd) 1, 3, 5, and 7. Half of the animals were housed during adolescence (pnd 21-35) in an enriched environment. The consequences on behavior were assessed throughout adolescence to adulthood. When scored for social performance, adolescent rats exposed to neonatal asphyxia exhibited exaggerated levels of anogenital sniffing behavior, which was normalized by enriched living. In air-exposed controls, enriched living increased the expression of affiliative and novelty-seeking behaviors, as compared to standard housing. However, this enrichment-induced behavioral plasticity was not found in rats neonatally exposed to asphyxia. At adulthood, levels of impulsivity and 5-HT(2A) receptors in the striatum were markedly increased in neonatal-asphyxia rats kept in standard-housing conditions. Interestingly, impulsivity and receptor density were normalized by enriched rearing during adolescence. These findings indicate profound long-lasting behavioral alterations as a consequence of repeated neonatal asphyxia in rats. Beneficial effects of stimulation by an enriched environment during the still-plastic window of adolescence are suggested in these animals.
