Yagaloff, K. A. and P. R. Hartig (1985). "125I-lysergic acid diethylamide binds to a novel serotonergic site on rat choroid plexus epithelial cells." J Neurosci 5(12): 3178-3183.

	125I-Lysergic acid diethylamide (125I-LSD) binds with high affinity to serotonergic sites on rat choroid plexus. These sites were localized to choroid plexus epithelial cells by use of a novel high resolution stripping film technique for light microscopic autoradiography. In membrane preparations from rat choroid plexus, the serotonergic site density was 3100 fmol/mg of protein, which is 10-fold higher than the density of any other serotonergic site in brain homogenates. The choroid plexus site exhibits a novel pharmacology that does not match the properties of 5-hydroxytryptamine-1a (5-HT1a), 5-HT1b, or 5-HT2 serotonergic sites. 125I-LSD binding to the choroid plexus site is potently inhibited by mianserin, serotonin, and (+)-LSD. Other serotonergic, dopaminergic, and adrenergic agonists and antagonists exhibit moderate to weak affinities for this site. The rat choroid plexus 125I-LSD binding site appears to represent a new type of serotonergic site which is located on non-neuronal cells in this tissue.
