Tsukada, H., et al. (2004). "Transient focal ischemia affects the cAMP second messenger system and coupled dopamine D-1 and 5-HT1A receptors in the living monkey brain: A positron emission tomography study using microdialysis." Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism 24(8): 898-906.

	Using positron emission tomography (PET) and microdialysis, the present study showed that neuronal damages after transient focal ischemia was partly induced by hyperactivation of the cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) second messenger system through modulations of dopamine D, and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in the living brains of cynomolgus monkeys. Occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery for 3 hours suppressed CBF in the striatum, and reperfusion induced hyperperfusion in the neocortex and striatum of the occluded side. Six hours after reperfusion, the activity of the cAMP second messenger system assayed with [C-11]rolipram was significantly facilitated in the neocortex and striatum where CBF was lowered more than 40% of normal during occlusion ("ischemic" area). Seven days later, impaired dopamine D, and 5-HT1A receptor binding, measured with [C-11]SCH23390 and [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635, respectively, was observed in the ischemic area. Microdialysis analysis revealed that the striatal dopamine level provided a transient and marked increased during occlusion and after reperfusion, whereas the cortical serotonin level transiently increased only after reperfusion, and was at an undetectable level thereafter. Administration of rolipram (0.1 and 1 mg/kg, intravenously) during occlusion facilitated reduction of dopamine D, binding, whereas rolipram administration 6 hours after reperfusion induced a further decrease in 5-HT1A receptor binding. These results suggest that the activation of cAMP second messenger system modulated by doparnine D-1 and 5-HT1A receptors could be involved in the neuronal degeneration after transient cerebral ischemic insult.
