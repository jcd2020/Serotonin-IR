	The past decade has seen important advances in the clinical utility of serotonergic agents. The putative novel anxiolytic effects of 5-HT1A partial agonists such as buspirone, the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin (5-HT) uptake blockers such as fluoxetine, and the unique and potent antiemetic effects of 5-HT3 antagonists in cancer chemotherapy are excellent examples of the clinical relevance of selective 5-HT receptor agents. The increasing ability to modulate serotonergic neurotransmission through distinct 5-HT receptor subtypes should greatly facilitate the analysis of 5-HT in both normal and abnormal human brain function.
