Mathis, C. A., et al. (1994). "C-11 WAY-100635 - A RADIOLIGAND FOR IMAGING 5-HT1A RECEPTORS WITH POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY." Life Sci 55(20): PL403-PL407.

	The potent and selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)clohexanecarboxamide) was radiolabeled with C-11 in high specific activity, and the in vivo properties of this radioligand were assessed in the brains of rats and monkeys. Following i.v. tail vein injection in rats, [C-11]WAY 100635 rapidly penetrated into brain tissue and was retained over a 30-90 min time period in a manner consistent with the known distribution of 5-HT1A receptors. Pretreatment of rats with the selective 5-HT1A agonist (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT effectively blocked the retention of radioactivity in brain regions known to contain high densities of 5-HT1A receptors. The hippocampus-to-cerebellum radioactivity concentration ratio reached a maximum of 16:1 at 60 min post injection. Following i.v. injection of [C-11]WAY 100635 in rhesus monkeys, the concentrations of radioactivity in brain regions were consistent with the reported distribution of 5-HT1A receptors in primates, and the frontal cortex-to-cerebellum ratio reached 5.5:1 at 80 min post injection. Pretreatment of the monkeys with (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT reduced this ratio to 1.4:1, and injection of (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT 20 min after the injection of [C-11]WAY100635 significantly displaced frontal cortex binding. The in vivo properties of [C-11]WAY 100635 in rats and monkeys strongly support the future utility of this radioligand for imaging 5-HT1A receptors using positron emission tomography (PET).
