	The effects of the Shuyu capsule on 5-HT(3A)R and 5-HT(3B)R expression in a rat model of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) depression and on 5-HT(3A)R and 5-HT(3B)R expression and hippocampal neuron 5-HT(3) channel current were investigated, to elucidate its mechanism of action against PMS depression. PMS depression model rats were divided into depression and Shuyu- and fluoxetine-treated groups, which were compared to control rats for frontal lobe and hippocampal 5-HT(3A)R and 5-HT(3B)R expression and behavior. The depressed model rats displayed symptoms of depression, which were reduced in treated and normal control rats. Frontal lobe and hippocampal 5-HT(3A)R and 5-HT(3B)R levels were significantly higher in the model versus the control group and were significantly lower in the Shuyu group. As compared to control rats, the 5-HT(3)R channel current in the model group was significantly higher; the 5-HT(3)R channel current in hippocampal neurons treated with serum from Shuyu group rats was significantly lower than that in those treated with model group serum. Thus, PMS depression may be related to 5-HT(3A)R and 5-HT(3B)R expression and increased 5-HT(3) channel current. Shuyu capsules rectified abnormal 5-HT(3A)R and 5-HT(3B)R expression and 5-HT(3) channel current changes in a rat model; this finding may provide insight into treating PMS depression.
