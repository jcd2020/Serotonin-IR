	Atypical antipsychotics increase dopamine ( DA) release in the medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC), an effect possibly involved in the superior effects of atypical versus classical antipsychotics on cognitive/negative symptoms. We examined the role of 5-HT1A receptors in the mPFC on the modulation of dopaminergic activity and the mesocortical DA release in vivo. The highly selective 5-HT1A agonist BAY x 3702 ( BAY; 10-40 mu g/kg, i.v.) increased the firing rate and burst firing of DA neurons in the ventral tegmental area ( VTA) and DA release in the VTA and mPFC. The increase in DA release in both areas was potentiated by nomifensine coperfusion. The selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 reversed the effects of BAY in both areas, and the changes in the VTA were prevented by frontocortical transection. The application of BAY in rat and mouse mPFC by reverse dialysis increased local extracellular DA at a low concentration ( 3 mu M) and reduced it at a higher concentration ( 30 mu M). Both effects disappeared in 5-HT1A knock-out mice. In the presence of bicuculline, BAY reduced DA release at all concentrations. The atypical antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine, and ziprasidone ( but not haloperidol) enhanced DA release in the mPFC of wild-type but not 5-HT1A knock-out mice after systemic and local ( clozapine and olanzapine) administration in the mPFC. Likewise, bicuculline coperfusion prevented the elevation of DA release produced by local clozapine or olanzapine application. These results suggest that the activation of mPFC 5-HT1A receptors enhances the activity of VTADA neurons and mesocortical DA release. This mechanism may be involved in the elevation of extracellular DA produced by atypical antipsychotics.
