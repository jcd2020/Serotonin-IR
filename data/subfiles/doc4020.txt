	The endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment protein-53 (ERGIC-53, aka LMAN1), which cycles between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, is a known cargo receptor for a number of soluble proteins. However, whether LMAN1 plays a role as a trafficking factor in the central nervous system is largely unknown. Here, we determined the role of LMAN1 on endogenous protein levels of the Cys-loop superfamily of neuroreceptors, including gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs), 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) type 3 (5-HT3) receptors, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Knockdown of LMAN1 reduces the surface trafficking of endogenous beta3 subunits of GABAARs in mouse hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons. Furthermore, Western blot analysis of brain homogenates from LMAN1 knockout mice demonstrated that loss of LMAN1 decreases the total protein levels of 5HT3A receptors and gamma2 subunits of GABAARs. LMAN1 knockout regulates the ER proteostasis network by upregulating ERP44 without changing calnexin levels. Interestingly, despite the critical role of the glycan-binding function of LMAN1 in its other known cargo clients, LMAN1 interacts with GABAARs in a glycan-independent manner. In summary, LMAN1 is a trafficking factor for certain neuroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is the first report of LMAN1 function in membrane protein trafficking.
