	Pharmacological studies have suggested that the serotonin 5-HT(2C) receptor is involved in locomotor activity, anxiety, and fear memory. However, the results of locomotor activity and anxiety in 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout mice have been mixed, and the effects of 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout on contextual fear memory have not yet been addressed. In the present study, we reconcile these inconsistent results by analyzing behavioral data in detail and by examining the effects of 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout on contextual fear memory. We demonstrated that the higher locomotor activity in 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout mice was observed only in the late phase of the test, indicating that the analyses in the previous study using the total locomotor activity would lead to variable results. Moreover, by analyzing mouse behavior in detail, we found that 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout mice displayed a hesitating attitude by staying in the central area as well as risk assessment behavior in the elevated plus-maze test. However, the time spent in the open arms was longer in 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout mice than in wild-type littermates when a zero-maze test lacking the central area was used. In the contextual fear conditioning test, 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout mice showed rapid within-session extinction of fear, but not between-session extinction, compared with wild-type littermates. However, this remains inconclusive because the facilitation of extinction might be confounded with higher locomotor activity in 5-HT(2C) receptor knockout mice. Taken together, the present results provide reasonable explanations about previous inconsistent findings and partially filled the gaps between pharmacological and genetic findings.
