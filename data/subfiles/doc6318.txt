	Acute cocaine reduces renin secretion. To determine whether serotonergic neurons mediate this effect, male Sprague-Dawley rats received the serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (75-mu-g/side, ICV) 2 weeks prior to cocaine injections (3.75-15 mg/kg, IP). 5-HT lesions attenuated the cocaine-induced reduction of plasma renin concentration (PRC), suggesting a partial 5-HT role. To determine which receptors mediate this response, rats were pretreated with the partial 5-HT1A agonist 8-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-l-piperazinyl]ethyl]-8-azaspirol-[4,5]-decane-7,9-dione (BMY 7378) (1 mg/kg, SC), the 5-HT1C/5-HT2 antagonist ritanserin (0.1 mg/kg, SC), or the alpha-2/5-HT1A antagonist yohimbine (1 mg/kg, SC) prior to cocaine. None of the antagonists altered the cocaine-induced suppression of PRC, although BMY 7378 and yohimbine elevated PRC. The data suggest that cocaine's effect is partially mediated by a serotonergic mechanism, but do not support a role for 5-HT1A receptors, 5-HT2/5-HT1C receptors, or alpha-2-adrenoceptors in mediating the suppressive effect of cocaine on renin secretion.
