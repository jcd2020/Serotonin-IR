Matsuda, T., et al. (2001). "Functional alteration of brain dopaminergic system in isolated aggressive mice." Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi 21(3): 71-76.

	The present study examined the effects of social isolation on cortical dopamine (DA) release in vivo and on brain DA receptor functions to study the possible involvement of cortical DA neurons in an antiaggressive effect of the serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor agonist (S)-5-[3-[(1,4-benzodioxan-2-ylmethyl)amino] propoxy]-1,3-benzodioxole HCl (MKC-242). MKC-242 and the DA receptor agonist apomorphine reduced aggressive behavior in isolated mice. MKC-242 increased cortical DA release in vivo in mice, and the effect was antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide. The basal level of extracellular DA in the frontal cortex was higher in isolated mice than in grouped mice. MKC-242-induced and high K(+)-induced increases in the cortical DA release were less pronounced in isolated mice than in grouped mice. The effect of apomorphine on locomotor activity was more pronounced in isolated mice than in grouped mice. These findings suggest that the isolation stress enhances cortical DA release and the brain DA receptor function and reduces the responses of the dopaminergic terminals to 5-HT1A receptor stimulation and high K(+)-induced depolarization.
