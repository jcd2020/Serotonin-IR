	Anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) are partly misused by males in order to become brave and intoxicated and these agents are highly associated with psychosis, disinhibition, aggression and acts of violence. Since such behavioral states have been related to an imbalanced serotonergic system and the involvement of the serotonergic 5HT(1B) and the 5HT(2) receptors, it was important to discern the impact of AAS on these receptors. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of 2 weeks of treatment with the AAS nandrolone decanoate at three different doses (1, 5, 15 mg/kg/day) on the total specific binding of the radioligands [(125)I]-(+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) (5HT(2) receptors) by autoradiography. All doses caused a significant down-regulation of the 5HT(1B) receptor density in the hippocampal CA(1) and in the medial globus pallidus and a significant up-regulation of the 5HT(2) receptor density in the nucleus accumbens shell. Alterations in receptor density were also observed in the lateral globus pallidus, ventromedial hypothalamus, the amygdala and in the intermediate layers of various cortex regions. In conclusion, serotonergic 5HT(1B) or 5HT(2) receptors are likely to play important roles in mediating observed emotional states and behavioral changes among AAS abusers.
