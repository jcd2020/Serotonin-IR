Fay, R. and L. Kubin (2001). "5-HT(2A) receptor-like protein is present in small neurons located in rat mesopontine cholinergic nuclei, but absent from cholinergic neurons." Neurosci Lett 314(1-2): 77-81.

	The cholinergic neurons of the pedunculopontine and laterodorsal tegmental nuclei (PPN and LDN) increase their activity during wakefulness and REM sleep and interact with brainstem neurons containing serotonin (5-HT) and other amines. To determine whether mesopontine neurons that contain nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a marker for cholinergic cells, express 5-HT(2A) receptors, dual immunostaining for 5-HT(2A) receptor-like protein and NOS was employed with either peroxidase or fluorescent secondary probes. Within the PPN and LDN, different cells expressed 5-HT(2A) receptors and NOS. In addition to the lack of co-localization, the 5-HT(2A) receptor-expressing cells were smaller and less numerous than the adjacent NOS neurons. We propose that 5-HT(2A) receptor-expressing cells are local inhibitory interneurons whose one function is to ensure the reciprocal patterns of activity in subpopulations of mesopontine cholinergic and aminergic neurons.
