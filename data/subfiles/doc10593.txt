Stark, H., et al. (1996). "I-125 iodoproxyfan and related compounds: A reversible radioligand and novel classes of antagonists with high affinity and selectivity for the histamine H-3 receptor." Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 39(6): 1220-1226.

	The synthesis and biological evaluation of new histamine H-3 receptor antagonists with an iodinated aryl partial structure are described as part of an extensive research program to find model compounds for the development of a new radioligand with high H-3 receptor affinity and specific activity. All compounds were tested for their H-3 receptor antagonist activity in a [H-3]-histamine-release assay with synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex. The new leads with potent H-3 receptor antagonist activity belong to a series of derivatives of 3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propanol with carbamate (4-7), ester (8-16), and ether (17-22) as functional groups. Structure-activity relationships are discussed. The most active compound in the functional test (-log K-i = 8.3) and in binding studies with [H-3]-(R)-alpha-methylhistamine on rat cerebral cortex (-log K-i = 9.0) in vitro was 3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propyl(4-iodophenl)methyl ether (iodoproxyfan, 19) exhibiting no central H-3 receptor antagonist activity in vivo. The potency of iodopruxyfan is more than 300 times lower at H-1, H-2, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta(1), 5-HT2A, 5-HT3, and M(3) receptors than at histamine H-3 receptors. Because of the high potency and selectivity of 19, this compound has also been prepared in the [I-125]-iodinated form by a nucleophilic halogen exchange reaction using the corresponding bromo derivative 22 as a precursor. The newly prepared [I-125]iodoproxyfan (23) possesses advantageous pharmacological properties and fulfills all criteria of a useful radioligand.
