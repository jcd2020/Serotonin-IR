Cornfield, L. J., et al. (1991). "INTRINSIC ACTIVITY OF ENANTIOMERS OF 8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN AND ITS ANALOGS AT 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE1A RECEPTORS THAT ARE NEGATIVELY COUPLED TO ADENYLATE-CYCLASE." Molecular Pharmacology 39(6): 780-787.

	Although many different types of compounds have been tested for 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) binding affinity, much remains to be learned about the structural requirements associated with 5-HT1A agonism, partial agonism, and antagonism. The present study uses the forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase (FSC) assay as a functional screen in rat hippocampal membranes to examine structure-activity relationships for a series of enantiomers of novel analogs of the prototypic 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). The findings illustrate that there can be large enantiomeric differences in intrinsic acitivity at the 5-HT1A receptor, independent of enantiomeric effects on binding affinity. Generally, for each enantiomeric pair exhibiting stereoselective 5-HT1A binding, the enantiomer with the higher affinity also displayed the greater amount of 5-HT1A intrinsic activity in the FSC assay. Interestingly, the enantiomers of 8-OH-DPAT itself displayed stereoselective differences in intrinsic activity but not 5-HT1A affinity. Several of the compounds, namely (S)-UH-301, (2R,3R)-CM-12, and (1S,2R)-LEA-146, may have potential as prototypes for selective 5-HT1A antagonists, and (S)-UH-301 itself may be useful as a selective 5-HT1A antagonist. The FSC data presented here are in good agreement with reported measures of in vivo 5-HT1A activity, which were in part the basis of a recently proposed model for the 5-HT1A pharmacophore [J. Med. Chem. 34: 497-510 (1991)].
