	Migraine is a common, highly disabling disorder of the brain. It is generally considered to be an inherited disorder so that therapy largely centers on reducing the disability due to the problem through either effective treatment of the acute attack or preventive treatments to reduce headache frequency and severity. The tripton era produced the crucial development of 5-HT1B/1D recepter agonists, which are extremely effective for many patients. The two immediate and substantial unmet needs in migraine therapeutics are effective, nonvasoconstictor acute attack medicines and effective preventitives with minimal side effects. A range of options seems possible based on current science and early proof-of-principle studies. These include 5-HT1F recepter agonists, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) recepter antagonists, vanilloid TRPV1 recepter antagonists and agents that modify the nitric oxide synthesis cascade. On the preventative side, gap junction blockers are being actively studied, as is botulinum toxin. The future for the development of antimigraine treatments is bright, as are the prospects for better therapeutic outcomes for patients.
