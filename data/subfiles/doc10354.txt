	Chronic treatment with olanzapine causes desensitization of serotonin 2A receptor signaling. The purpose of the current study was to further understand the mechanisms underlying this desensitization response of serotonin 2A receptor signaling in vivo. We report that desensitization of serotonin 2A receptor stimulated-phospholipase C activity in rat frontal cortex induced by olanzapine is dependent on the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway. Olanzapine treatment for 7 days significantly increased the levels of the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS7) protein, RGS7 mRNA levels, and activation of JAK2 in rat frontal cortex. Pre-treatment with a JAK2 inhibitor AG490, significantly attenuated the olanzapine-induced reductions in serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated phospholipase C activity and prevented the olanzapine-induced increases in RGS7 mRNA and protein levels. In contrast, inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway with AG490 did not reverse the olanzapine-induced desensitization of the serotonin 2A receptor pathway in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus mediating increases in plasma hormone levels. AG490 dose-dependently inhibited serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated oxytocin and corticosterone release. These results suggest that the olanzapine-induced increase in RGS7 expression is mediated by the activation of JAK-STAT and is necessary for olanzapine-induced desensitization of serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated phospholipase C activity in the frontal cortex but not serotonin 2A receptor-stimulated hormone release.
