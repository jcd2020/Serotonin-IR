	The brainstem is the locus of serotonin (5-HT)-mediated myoclonus in the guinea pig, which is induced by 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (L-5-HTP) and indole but not piperazine 5-HT receptor agonists. As an initial step in testing the hypothesis that one 5-HT receptor subtype mediates this effect, we measured seven 5-HT receptor binding sites and the 5-HT uptake site in guinea pig brainstem and compared them to the rat. In guinea pig brainstem, the rank order of binding site density was: 5-HT transporter site >> 5-HT1D > antagonist-labeled 5-HT2 > 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C > 5-HT1E > agonist-labeled 5-HT2 binding site. There were fewer 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C binding sites and 5-HT uptake sites in guinea pig than rat brainstem, more 5-HT1D and antagonist-labeled 5-HT2 sites, but the differences were 2-fold or less. The major species difference was that 5-HT1B sites were virtually undetectable in guinea pig brainstem. Limited competition experiments with related 5-HT receptor subtype-selective agonists and antagonists suggested that the sites in guinea pig brainstem conformed to those described in the rat. 5-HT agonist and antagonist dose-threshold and dose maximum-effect data from guinea pig myoclonus in vivo were compared with receptor affinities at each receptor site in vitro from the literature. No convincing correlation between myoclonus and one particular 5-HT site was found. These data indicate the presence of a full complement of 5-HT receptor binding site subtypes in guinea pig brainstem with some species differences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
