	The effects of serotonin (5-HT) on excitability of two cortical interneuronal subtypes, fast-spiking (FS) and low threshold spike (LTS) cells, and on spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in layer V pyramidal cells were studied in rat visual cortical slices using whole-cell recording techniques. Twenty-two of 28 FS and 26 of 35 LTS interneurons responded to local application of 5-HT. In the group of responsive neurons, 5-HT elicited an inward current in 50% of FS cells and 15% of LTS cells, an outward current was evoked in 41% of FS cells and 81% of LTS cells, and an inward current followed by an outward current in 9% of FS cells and 4% LTS cells. The inward and outward currents were blocked by a 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist, tropisetron, and a 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist, NAN-190, respectively. The 5-HT-induced inward and outward currents were both associated with an increase in membrane conductance. The estimated reversal potential was more positive than -40 mV for the inward current and close to the calculated K(+) equilibrium potential for the outward current. The 5-HT application caused an increase, a decrease, or an increase followed by a decrease in the frequency of sIPSCs in pyramidal cells. The 5-HT(3) receptor agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl) biguanide increased the frequency of larger and fast-rising sIPSCs, whereas the 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist (+/-)8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin hydrobromide elicited opposite effects and decreased the frequency of large events. These data indicate that serotonergic activation imposes complex actions on cortical inhibitory networks, which may lead to changes in cortical information processing.
