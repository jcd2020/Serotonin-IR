Sevoz, C., et al. (1996). "Stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors in the NTS inhibits the cardiac Bezold-Jarisch reflex response." American Journal of Physiology-Heart and Circulatory Physiology 271(1): H80-H87.

	Intra-atrial administration of phenylbiguanide has been shown to trigger, through the stimulation of vagal afferent C-fibers, reflex bradycardia, hypotension, and sympathoinhibition classically known as the Bezold-Jarisch (B-J) reflex (O. Krayer. Nazcnyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Exp. Pathol. Pharmacol. 240: 361-368, 1961). The effects of microinjections, into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), of serotonin (5-HT) and 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (CPBG), a potent 5-HT3 receptor agonist, on these reflex responses were studied in urethan-anesthetized rats. 5-HT (600 and 900 pmol) and CPBG (10-150 pmol) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the atropine-sensitive bradycardiac component of the B-J reflex. The effect of both agonists was reversed by prior local microinjection of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists zacopride (100 pmol) and ondansetron (100 pmol), but not by that of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (10 pmol) or the mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist methysergide (100 pmol). In contrast, CPBG (150 pmol) did not affect the B-J reflex inhibition of lumbar sympathetic nerve discharge. These results show that stimulation of NTS 5-HT3 receptors produced an inhibition of the cardiovagal component of the B-J reflex without affecting its sympathetic component. Because the stimulation of these receptors also inhibits the cardiac component of the baroreflex, the present data suggest the participation of NTS 5-HT3 receptors in the mechanisms that modulate cardiac reflex responses elicited by messages from different vagal afferents.
