Girard, P., et al. (2006). "Role of catecholamines and serotonin receptor subtypes in nefopam-induced antinociception." Pharmacol Res 54(3): 195-202.

	The non-opiate analgesic nefopam has been shown to inhibit monoamines uptake, but little is known about receptor subtypes effectively involved in its analgesic effect. In vitro binding assays yielded the following measures of affinity (IC50): serotonergic 5-HT2C (1.4 mu M), 5-HT2A (5.1 mu M), 5-HT3 (22.3 mu M), 5-HT1B (41.7 mu M), 5-HT1A (64.9 mu M), adrenergic alpha(1) (15.0 mu M) and dopaminergic D-1 (100 mu M). Subcutaneous nefopam administration dose-dependently inhibited pain in acetic acid-induced writhing (1-30 mg kg(-1)) and formalin (1-10 mg kg(-1)) tests in the mouse. Pretreatments with adrenergic alpha(1), (prazosin) and alpha(2) (yohimbine), and serotonergic 5-HT1B (GR127935) receptor antagonists significantly increased the nefopam ED50 in the writhing test. The serotonergic 5-HT2C (RS102221) and the dopaminergic D-2 (sulpiride) receptor antagonists inhibited nefopam antinociception in the formalin test. However, in both tests, nefopam analgesic activity was not modified by the following receptor lantagonists: doparninergic D-1 (SCH23390), serotonergic 5-HT1A (NAN-190, WAY 100635), 5-HT2A (R96544, ketanserin), 5-HT3 (tropisetron), and 5-HT4 (SDZ205557). In conclusion, nefopam analgesic activity could be modulated by the adrenergic alpha(1), and alpha(2) receptors, the dopaminergic D-2 receptors, and the serotonergic 5-HTIB and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes.
