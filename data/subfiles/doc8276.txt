	Neonatal destruction of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system with the specific neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) leads to increases in several components of the adult serotonergic raphe-striatal system. Although results following similar lesions of adult ventral midbrain dopaminergic neurons are less consistent, increases in striatal serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT) fiber density, content, and metabolites have been reported. The effect of such lesions upon gene expression for striatal 5HT receptors, however, has not been determined. The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible changes in expression of several 5HT receptor mRNAs in rat striatum following destruction of the adult nigrostriatal pathway. In situ hybridization for 5HT1A, 5HT1C, and 5HT2 receptor subtype mRNAs was performed in rat striatum following unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the medial forebrain bundle or directly into the ventral midbrain. Compared to the uninjected control side, a significant increase in the hybridization density for 5HT2 receptor mRNA was observed in the caudate-putamen ipsilateral to the 6-OHDA lesion (P < 0.05). In contrast, no significant changes in the hybridization densities for 5HT1A or 5HT1C receptor mRNAs were detected. The observed increase in striatal 5HT2 receptor mRNA levels after the dopamine-depleting lesion provides evidence for plasticity of the serotonergic raphe-striatal system in the adult rat at the level of striatal gene expression. Furthermore, the present data indicate that dopaminergic mechanisms differentially regulate the expression of 5HT receptor mRNAs in adult rat striatum.
