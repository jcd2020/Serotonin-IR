Trichard, C., et al. (1998). "Binding of antipsychotic drugs to cortical 5-HT2A receptors: a PET study of chlorpromazine, clozapine, and amisulpride in schizophrenic patients." Am J Psychiatry 155(4): 505-508.

	OBJECTIVE: This study examined the binding to cortical serotonin 5-HT2A receptors of conventional doses of the typical neuroleptic chlorpromazine in comparison with clozapine, the prototype atypical antipsychotic, and amisulpride, a specific dopamine D2-D3 blocker. METHOD: Seventeen schizophrenic patients treated with chlorpromazine (75-700 mg/day), four treated with clozapine (200-600 mg/day), and five treated with amisulpride (200-1200 mg/day) were studied. Cortical 5-HT2A binding was estimated by reference to the values for 14 antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects with the use of positron emission tomography and [18F]setoperone, a high-affinity radioligand for cortical 5-HT2A receptors. RESULTS: A dose-dependent decrease in the number of available cortical binding sites for [18F] setoperone was demonstrated in the chlorpromazine group; for the highest dose, there was a virtual lack of sites available for binding. A very low percentage of available binding sites was also observed in the clozapine-treated patients at all doses. This suggests a high level of 5-HT2A blockade with both clozapine and high doses of chlorpromazine. No significant binding of amisulpride to 5-HT2A receptors was detected. CONCLUSIONS: A high level of 5-HT2A receptor blockade does not appear specific to clozapine in comparison with high doses of chlorpromazine, suggesting that the distinct clinical profiles of both drugs are unrelated to 5-HT2A blockade itself.
