Rhee, J. S., et al. (1996). "Serotonin modulates high-voltage-activated Ca2+ channels in rat ventromedial hypothalamic neurons." Neuropharmacology 35(8): 1093-1100.

	The modulation of high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels by serotonin (5-HT) was studied in ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH) neurons acutely dissociated from 12-14-day-old Wistar rats using the whole-cell and nystatin perforated-patch recording configurations. 5-HT inhibited the HVA Ca2+ channels in a concentration-, time- and voltage-dependent manner. This inhibition was mimicked by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin and was prevented by pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX), omega-Conotoxin-GVIA, omega-agatoxin-IVA, nicardipine and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC blocked each fraction of HVA Ca2+ channel currents, suggesting the existence of N-, P-, L- and Q-types of HVA Ca2+ channels. A component of the current resistant to these Ca2+ channel antagonists also existed in the VMH neurons. Among these five components of HVA Ca2+ channel currents, the N- and Q-type currents were significantly inhibited by 5-HT. These findings suggest that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors produces the selective inhibition of N- and Q-type Ca2+ channels through a PTX-sensitive G-protein in rat VMH neurons.
