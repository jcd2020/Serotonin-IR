	5-HT1A receptors are widely expressed in the brain and play a critical role in feedback inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) neurons through multiple mechanisms. Yet, it remains poorly understood how these feedback mechanisms, particularly those involving long-range projections, adapt in mood disorders. Here, we examined several aspects of 5-HT1A receptor function in the 5-HT transporter knockout mouse (SERT-KO), a model of vulnerability to stress and mood disorders. We found that in comparison to wildtype (WT) mice, SERT-KO mice had more passive coping in response to acute swim stress and this was accompanied by hypo-activation of medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) Fos expression. Both of these effects were reversed by systemically blocking 5-HT1A receptors. Ex-vivo electrophysiological experiments showed that 5-HT exerted greater 5-HT1A-mediated inhibitory effects in the mPFC of SERT-KO mice compared to WT. Since 5-HT1A receptors in the mPFC provide a key feedback regulation of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), we used a disinhibition strategy to examined endogenous feedback control of 5-HT neurons. Blocking 5-HT1A receptors disinhibited several fold more 5-HT neurons in the DRN of SERT-KO than in WT mice, revealing the presence of enhanced feedback inhibition of 5-HT neurons in the SERT-KO. Taken together our results indicate that increased stress sensitivity in the SERI-KO is associated with the enhanced capacity of 5-HT1A receptors to inhibit neurons in the mPFC as well as to exert feedback inhibition of DRN 5-HT neurons.
