Jankowska, E. and W. Kostowski (1995). "THE EFFECT OF TROPISETRON INJECTED INTO THE NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS-SEPTI ON ETHANOL-CONSUMPTION IN RATS." Alcohol 12(3): 195-198.

	Earlier studies have shown that 5-HT3 antagonists possess properties of reducing ethanol (EtOH) preference and intake in EtOH high-preferring rats. In this study we examined the effect of tropisetron (ICS 205-930) microinjection (1 and 10 ng) into the nucleus accumbens septi (NAS) on EtOH drinking in a scheduled access to EtOH paradigm. Control rats received vehicle only. Tropisetron, when injected bilaterally into the NAS, significantly reduced EtOH intake in EtOH high-preferring animals. It is concluded that 5-HT3 antagonists might exert their antipreference activity by influencing the receptors within the NAS and that 5-HT3 receptors might play an important role in reinforcing properties of EtOH.
