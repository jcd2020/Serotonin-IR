	Overactivation of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT)(2A) receptors causes impulsivity and attentional deficits. Since 5-HT2A receptors are known to entertain antagonistic interactions with metabotropic glutamate (mGlu)2/3 receptors, this interaction may provide an alternative target for a novel class of antipsychotics. The study characterizes interactions between 5-HT2A and mGlu2/3 receptors implicated in impulse control. Hooded Lister rats were trained in a 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) and treated with the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropan hydrochloride (DOI, 0.1 mg/kg) and the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268 (1 mg/kg). In addition, associated drug-induced changes in neuronal activity were assessed via c-Fos immunoreactivity (Fos IR), and co-localization of c-Fos and GABAergic markers was detected using double immunofluorescence labeling. Systemic DOI caused impulsive overresponding that was attenuated in animals pre-treated with LY379268. LY379268 itself had no significant effect on the rats' performance in the 5-CSRTT. DOI enhanced Fos IR within fronto-cortical and limbic brain structures, and this effect was blocked by LY379268 pre-treatment. Double immunofluorescence labeling showed a specific co-localization of DOI-elicited Fos IR with GABAergic (GAD(67)-positive) cells lacking the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin while LY379268 increased Fos IR in GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells. Our results suggest that impulsivity is possibly due to a primary increase in Glu transmission mediated via 5-HT2A receptor activation. Thus, mGlu2/3 receptor agonists might have some potential for treating motor impulsivity-related impairments while their cognitive enhancing effects were not confirmed in this study.
