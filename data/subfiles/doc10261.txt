	Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) syndrome is a potentially life-threatening neurotoxic condition provoked by pharmacologically induced excess serotonergic activity. Several studies report that nitric oxide (NO) and glutamate play a role in psychostimulant-induced hyperthermia related to neurotoxicity. In the present study, the involvement of NO and glutamate, as well as the effect of risperidone, a potent 5-HT(2A) and D(2) (and a less potent D(1)) receptor antagonist, were investigated in animal models of 5-HT syndrome. Two 5-HT syndrome animal models were utilized. The first model was induced by administration of tranylcypromine, a nonselective monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor, and fluoxetine, a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. The second model was induced by the administration of clorgyline, an MAO-A inhibitor, and 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan, a precursor of 5-HT. Changes in the level of NO metabolites and glutamate in the anterior hypothalamus were measured using microdialysis. In both models, NO metabolite levels significantly increased, and this increase was significantly attenuated by risperidone pretreatment. Extracellular levels of glutamate were increased only in the tranylcypromine and fluoxetine model, and this increase was significantly attenuated by risperidone pretreatment. These results indicate that NO and glutamate may be involved in the development of 5-HT syndrome and that risperidone may be effective against neurotransmitter abnormalities in 5-HT syndrome.
