Davidson, C. and J. A. Stamford (1998). "Contrasting effects of chronic paroxetine on 5-HT1A control of dorsal raphe cell firing and 5-HT release." Neuroreport 9(11): 2535-2538.

	To test the role of 5-HT1A receptors in the action of antidepressants, we investigated the effect of chronic paroxetine (10 mg/kg, p.o. for 21 days) on functional assays of 5-HT1A sensitivity. We constructed cumulative concentration response curves to the selective 5-HT1A agonist (+)-8-OH-DPAT on both extracellular recordings of 5-HT neurones and electrically stimulated 5-HT release in dorsal raphe brain slices. Chronic paroxetine desensitized the 5-HT1A receptors controlling firing, with an increase in EC50 from 10.7 nM to 46.2 nM 8-OH-DPAT. Chronic paroxetine did not, however, desensitize the 5-HT1A receptors controlling 5-HT release but increased the 8-OH-DPAT Emax from 54.9% to 79.2% inhibition of 5-HT release. These data suggest that there are either two distinct populations of 5-HT1A receptors or separate second messenger systems, one controlling 5-HT release and another influencing firing. Furthermore chronic paroxetine treatment can differentially modulate these different populations.
