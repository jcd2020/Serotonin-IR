Popova, N. K., et al. (1996). "Effect of antagonists and agonists of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 serotonin receptors on the predator aggressiveness of wild Norway rats." Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine 121(6): 621-623.

	The effect of agonists of serotonin receptors on predator aggressiveness (the ''mouse killing'' test) is studied on Norway rats. Ipsapirone and eltoprazine are found to have no effect on predator aggressiveness. 1-[3-(Trifluoromethyl)phenyl]piperazine x HCl (TFMPP) considerably reduces aggressiveness. The serotonin precursor 5-hydroxyptryptophan also lowers it, while the antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors ketanserin abolishes the inhibitory effect of 5-hydroxytryptophan. Presumably, the inhibitory effects of serotonin on predator aggressiveness are realized via the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C brain serotonin receptors.
