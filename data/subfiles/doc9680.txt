Okamoto, K., et al. (2005). "Central serotonin 3 receptors play an important role in the modulation of nociceptive neural activity of trigeminal subnucleus caudalis and nocifensive orofacial behavior in rats with persistent temporomandibular joint inflammation." Neuroscience 135(2): 569-581.

	The role of central serotonin 3 receptors on neural activities recorded from superficial laminae of trigeminal subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical spinal cord junction region was investigated using rats with (Complete Freund's Adjuvant day 7 group) or without (non-Complete Freund's Adjuvant group) persistent temporomandibular joint inflammation evoked by Complete Freund's Adjuvant for 7 days. We identified two types of units, Deep-wide dynamic range units and Skin-wide dynamic range units from extracellular recordings. Deep-wide dynamic range units have mechanoreceptive fields in the deep craniofacial tissues including masseter muscle but do not have cutaneous mechanoreceptive fields. Deep-wide dynamic range unit discharges evoked by the formalin injection into masseter muscle were significantly enhanced in the late phase in Complete Freund's Adjuvant day 7 group. Discharges of Skin-wide dynamic range units evoked by the noxious pinch stimulation to facial skin in Complete Freund's Adjuvant day 7 group were significantly enhanced compared with those in non-Complete Freund's Adjuvant group. Topical administration of central serotonin 3 receptor antagonist, tropisetron, onto trigeminal subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical spinal cord junction region significantly reduced both formalin-evoked Deep-wide dynamic range unit and pinch-evoked Skin-wide dynamic range unit discharges in non-Complete Freund's Adjuvant and Complete Freund's Adjuvant day 7 groups significantly. The inhibitory effects of tropisetron on pinch-evoked Skin-wide dynamic range unit discharges were prolonged in Complete Freund's Adjuvant day 7 group compared with those in non-Complete Freund's Adjuvant group. The role of central serotonin 3 receptors in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical spinal cord junction region was also tested by orofacial formalin test in Complete Freund's Adjuvant day 7 group. Intracisternal administration of tropisetron decreased the orofacial nocifensive behavior in the late phase evoked by the injection of formalin into the masseter muscle. These results suggest that central serotonin 3 receptors in trigeminal subnucleus caudalis/upper cervical spinal cord junction region are involved in mediating pronociceptive effects in both superficial and deep craniofacial tissues nociception during persistent temporomandibular joint inflammation.
