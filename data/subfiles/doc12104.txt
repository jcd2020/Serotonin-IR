Yeh, Y. W. (2011). "Persistent Hiccups Associated With Switching From Risperidone to Aripiprazole in a Schizophrenic Patient With Cerebral Palsy." Clinical Neuropharmacology 34(4): 135-136.

	Antipsychotics are thought to be effective in the treatment of hiccups; however, they are rarely reported to induce hiccups. We report a case of persistent hiccups after administration of aripiprazole in a patient with concurrence of schizophrenia and cerebral palsy. Prior brain injury and switching antipsychotics may precipitate the development of hiccups in the present case. Aripiprazole with a partial agonist of dopamine D(2) receptors and serotonin 1A receptors may play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of hiccups.
