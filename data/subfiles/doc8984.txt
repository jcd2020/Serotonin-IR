Mosher, T., et al. (2005). "Differential effects of 5-HT2C receptor ligands on place conditioning and locomotor activity in rats." Eur J Pharmacol 515(1-3): 107-116.

	Effects of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(IA/IB/2C) receptor agonist N-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl] piperazine (TFMPP, 0-3.0 mg/kg s.c.) and the 5-HT2C receptor agonist 8,9-dichloro-2,3,4,4a-tetrahydro-1H-pyrazino[1,2-alpha]quinoxalin-5(6H)-one (WAY 161503, 0-3.0 mg/kg s.c.) in place conditioning were measured in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Effects of TFMPP, alone and with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-cyclohexanecarboxainine (WAY 100635), the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist N[4-methoxy-3-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) phenyl]-2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)-1,1'-biphenyl-4-carboxamide (GR 127935)or the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist 6-chloro-5-methyl-1-[[2-(2-methylpyrid-3-yloxy)pyrid-5-yl]carbamoyl]indoline (SB 242084) and of WAY 161503 alone and with SB 242084 on locomotor activity were also assessed. Neither TFMPP nor WAY 161503 induced place conditioning. WAY 161503 (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg s.c.) decreased locomotor activity; SB 242084 (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) blocked this effect. Reduced locomotor activity following TFMPP was blocked by SB 242084 but not WAY 100635 (0.1 mg/kg s.c.) or GR 127935 (3.0 mg/kg s.c.). Behaviourally relevant levels of 5-HT2C, receptor stimulation may not exert reinforcing effects, although other studies indicate that such manipulations alter reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse.
