Obuchowicz, E. and J. Turchan (1999). "Clozapine decreases neuropeptide Y-like immunoreactivity and neuropeptide Y mRNA levels in rat nucleus accumbens." Eur Neuropsychopharmacol 9(4): 329-335.

	The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acute, subchronic (14 days) and chronic (28 days) intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of clozapine (10 or 25 mg/kg) on neuropeptide Y (NPY) system activity in the nucleus accumbens of the rat. NPY-like immunoreactivity (NPY-LI) decreased 24 h after subchronic clozapine while NPY mRNA after both acute and subchronic clozapine treatment. NPY-LI levels were also reduced 8 days after cessation of chronic lower-dose treatment. Subchronic (14 days) administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (1 mg/kg i.p.) or the dopamine D2/D3 antagonist (+/-) sulpiride (100 mg/kg i.p.) reduced NPY-LI levels, whereas the dopamine D1-like antagonist SCH 23390 (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), dopamine D4 antagonist L-745,870 (1 mg/kg per os), and alpha1-adrenergic antagonist prazosin (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect. There were no significant differences between the ketanserin-induced decrease in NPY-LI levels and the effects of the following two-drug combinations: ketanserin and SCH 23390, ketanserin and L-745,870, and ketanserin and prazosin. The study has shown that clozapine reduces NPY system activity in the rat nucleus accumbens. It seems that the action of clozapine is partly mediated by blockade of 5-HT2A and D2/D3 dopaminergic receptors.
