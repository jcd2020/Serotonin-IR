Wilson, A. A., et al. (1996). "F-18 fluoroalkyl analogues of the potent 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635: Radiosyntheses and in vivo evaluation." Nuclear Medicine and Biology 23(4): 487-490.

	Two analogues of the potent 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 have been synthesized and radiolabelled with F-18, namely N-[2-[4-(2-2'-[F-18]fluoroethoxyphenyl)-1-peperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexane carboxamide ([F-18]FEC) and N-[2-[4-(2-3'-[F-18]fluoropropoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexane carboxamide ([F-18]FPC). Biodistribution studies in rats showed selective uptake of both radiotracers in regions known to be rich in 5-HT1A receptors following i.v. injection. The ratio of radioactivity in hippocampus to that in the cerebellum was 5.5 (for [F-18]FEC) and 7.5 (for [F-18]FPC) at 60 min postinjection. Regional brain heterogeneity of radioactivity could be abolished by pretreatment with WAY 100635 and FPC but was unaffected by pretreatment with a variety of drugs including ketanserin, sulpiride, and SCH 23390. These results are compared vis a vis with those obtained using [C-11]WAY 100635 to evaluate [F-18]FEC and [F-18]FPC as potential radiotracers for imaging 5-HT1A receptors by positron emission tomography.
