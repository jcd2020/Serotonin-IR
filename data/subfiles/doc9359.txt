	OBJECTIVES: NLX-112 (befiradol, F13640) is a selective serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Although it has been tested in vivo, little has been reported on its in vitro signal transduction profile. METHODS: NLX-112 was tested on G-protein activation, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) and receptor internalization in recombinant cell lines. NLX-112 was also tested on G-protein activation in rat hippocampal membranes. Galpha subunit mRNA expression in cell lines and rat brain tissue was quantified by quantitative PCR. KEY FINDINGS: For all signalling measures, NLX-112 exhibited agonist efficacy greater than for reference compounds ((+/-)8-OH-DPAT or buspirone), but similar to the endogenous agonist, serotonin, and was more potent for pERK than other responses. In rat hippocampal membranes, NLX-112 stimulated 'total G-proteins' but, unlike (+/-)8-OH-DPAT and buspirone, was more potent for Galphao activation. Cell lines predominantly expressed Galphai1 and Galphai2 mRNA, with low levels of Galphao, whereas in rat brain Galphao subunits showed highest mRNA expression. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike reference compounds, NLX-112 was a highly efficacious agonist in vitro, preferentially activating pERK in cell lines and Galphao proteins in rat hippocampal membranes. However, Galpha subunit mRNA levels differ markedly between rat brain and cell lines, warranting caution when extrapolating from recombinant systems to native tissues.
