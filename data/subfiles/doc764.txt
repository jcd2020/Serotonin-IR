	The ability of 5-HT1 receptor agonists to modulate a chemically induced defence response has been studied in Lister hooded rats. Microinjections of the excitatory amino acid D,L-homocysteic acid (DLH) in both rostral and caudal dorsal periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) caused explosive motor behaviour characteristic of defence. This behaviour was quantified in terms of response duration, arena revolutions and number of defensive jumps. Direct administration into the PAG of either 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) or 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OHDPAT) produced behaviours (decreased exploratory rearing, dose related onset of flat body posture) indicative of 5-HT1A receptor activation. Pretreatment with either 5-CT or 8-OHDPAT directly in the PAG caused a significant attenuation, and in some cases a complete abolition, of the DLH evoked response. These agonists share high affinity in vitro for the 5-HT1A receptor. Thus the results suggest that in vivo activation of 5-HT1A receptors mediates an antiaversive response with respect to defensive behaviour elicited by specific chemical stimulation of the dorsal PAG.
