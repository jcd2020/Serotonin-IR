Kato, T., et al. (1990). "Binding profile of SM-9018, a novel antipsychotic candidate." Jpn J Pharmacol 54(4): 478-481.

	The present study employed various receptor-binding assays to clarify the biochemical characteristics of SM-9018. SM-9018 possessed very high affinity for 5-HT2, D2 and 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 0.61, 1.4 and 2.9 nM, respectively), and it had moderate affinity for alpha 1 and D1 receptors (Ki = 17 and 41 nM, respectively). However, SM-9018 had only negligible affinity for alpha 2, opiate, glutamate, phencyclidine, benzodiazepine and GABAA receptors. These results suggest that SM-9018 may be a novel antipsychotic agent with binding affinity for 5-HT2 and 5-HT1A receptors.
