Johnson, E. A., et al. (1996). "The anxiolytic serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonists buspirone, ipsapirone and gepirone are inhibitors of tyrosine hydroxylation in rat striatum." Behavioural Brain Research 73(1-2): 331-335.

	The anxiolytics buspirone (BUS), ipsapirone (IPSAP) and gepirone (GEP) were investigated as 5-HT1A receptor-mediated inhibitors of tyrosine hydroxylation (TH) in a synaptosome-rich preparation of rat striatum. BUS, IPSAP and GEP were moderately potent inhibitors of TH with EC(50) values of 48.4 mu M, 50 mu M and 836 mu M, respectively. By comparison, 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor selective agonist, has been previously shown to be more potent with an EC(50) value of 7.0 mu M. Each of these agents demonstrated full agonist activity at the striatal 5-HT1A receptors regulating TH. The inhibitory effects of each agent were attenuated by prior exposure to the 5-HT1A antagonist NAN-190, (10 mu M) (P<0.05), but not by the dopamine D-2 antagonist (-)-sulpiride (10 mu M). The potencies of 8-OH-DPAT, BUS, IPSAP and GEP were correlated with their reported affinities for the 5-HT1A receptor (P<0.01) but not the dopamine D-2 receptor. These results support the hypothesis that BUS, IPSAP and GEP inhibit TH through activation of a striatal 5-HT1A heteroreceptor on dopamine nerve terminals.
