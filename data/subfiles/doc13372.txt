	p11 (S100A10), a member of a large family of S100 proteins, interacts with serotonin receptor 1B (5-HTR1B), modulates 5-HT1B receptor signal transduction, and is required for antidepressant responses to activation of this receptor. In the current study, we investigated the specificity of the interaction between 5-HTR1B and p11 by screening brain-expressed S100 proteins against serotonin and noradrenergic receptors. The data indicate that p11 is unique among its family members for its interactions with defined serotonin receptors. We identify a novel p11-interacting receptor (5-HTR4) and characterize the interaction between p11 and 5-HTR4, demonstrating that (1) p11 and 5-HTR4 mRNA and protein are coexpressed in brain regions that are relevant for major depression, (2) p11 increases 5-HTR4 surface expression and facilitates 5-HTR4 signaling, and (3) p11 is required for the behavioral antidepressant responses to 5-HTR4 stimulation in vivo. The essential role played by p11 in modulating signaling through 5-HT4 as well as 5-HT1B receptors supports the concept that this protein may be a key determinant of vulnerability to depression.
