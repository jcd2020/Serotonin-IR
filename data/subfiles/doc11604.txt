	1) The binding characteristics of [3H]5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) were investigated in membrane preparations of several regions from calf, pig and human brain in the presence of 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2[di-n-dipropylamino]tetralin) and 100 nmol/l mesulergine in order to mask 5-HT1A and 5-HT1C sites. 2) [3H]5-HT bound rapidly, reversibly and stereo-selectively to a population of high affinity recognition sites in membranes from pig caudate, calf caudate and human cortex, caudate and substantia nigra. 3) Saturation experiments carried out with [3H]5-HT in the presence of 100 nmol/l 8-OH-DPAT and 100 nmol/l mesulergine revealed that non-5-HT1A non-5-HT1C sites represented from 50 to more than 90% of the total 5-HT1 sites (determined with [3H]5-HT in the absence of 8-OH-DPAT and mesulergine), depending on the tissue source. 4) The pharmacological profile of these sites was characterized in competition experiments performed with a variety of ligands in membranes of calf, pig and human caudate membranes. Under these conditions, [3H]5-HT labelled a population of "5-HT1-like" sites which display nanomolar affinity for tryptamines (5-carboxamidotryptamine greater than 5-HT greater than or equal to 5-methoxytryptamine greater than tryptamine) and some ergolines (metergoline greater than methysergide). In contrast, these sites showed low affinity for drugs with high affinity and/or selectivity for 5-HT1A (8-OH-DPAT, buspirone), 5-HT1B (21-009, RU 24969), 5-HT1C (mesulergine, mianserin) and 5-HT2 sites (ketanserin, cinanserin).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
