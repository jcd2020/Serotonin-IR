Mori, K., et al. (2001). "Different effects of anxiolytic agents, diazepam and 5-HT(1A) agonist tandospirone, on hippocampal long-term potentiation in vivo." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 69(3-4): 367-372.

	Benzodiazepines and 5-HT(1A) agonists have been widely used as anxiolytic agents. Some clinical reports document that 5-HT(1A) agonists induce memory impairment to a lesser degree than diazepam. In the present study, we compared the effects of diazepam and 5-HT(1A) agonist, tandospirone, on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in Schaffer collateral-CA1, mossy fiber-CA3 and perforant path-dentate gyrus synapses. In the diazepam-injected group, the reduction in LTP was observed in all three types of synapses, although the effective dose differed among these. In the tandospirone-injected group, no reduction in LTP was observed except in Schaffer-CA1 synapses. In addition, population spike amplitude was potentiated by tandospirone in mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, there was a discrepancy in the effects on hippocampal LTP between diazepam and tandospirone, possibly reflecting the reported clinical properties of these drugs, in that 5-HT(1A) partial agonists do not affect learning and memory, whereas diazepam impairs memory function.
