Saksida, L. M., et al. (1993). "Predator-induced opioid and non-opioid mediated analgesia in young meadow voles: sex differences and developmental changes." Brain Res 617(2): 214-219.

	The present study examined developmental changes in the nociceptive responses of male and female meadow voles, Microtus pennsylvanicus, exposed to a garter snake, a natural predator of young voles. After 15 min of exposure to the presence of a garter snake, neonatal-juvenile voles (5-20 days of age) displayed naloxone (1.0 mg/kg)-sensitive opioid mediated analgesic responses, while after a brief 30-s exposure to the snake, voles displayed a higher amplitude, non-opioid analgesia that was insensitive to naloxone and blocked by the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. The levels of opioid and non-opioid mediated analgesia declined during development as the threat presented by the snake decreased. Young female voles also displayed a significantly greater non-opioid, 5-HT1A sensitive analgesia than males, with no significant sex differences in the lower amplitude opioid analgesia. These results indicate that young (neonatal) meadow voles that are exposed to a naturally threatening stimulus display sexually dimorphic analgesic responses. These findings also illustrate the need to consider the ecological context when examining environmentally-induced analgesia.
