	Patients with seizure disorders have an increased incidence of depression. This may be due in part to psychosocial factors; or side effects of antiepileptic drugs. However, there may be underlying physiologic mechanisms for the relationship. Neuroimaging studies, including structural magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography measurements of cerebral glucose metabolism, and, more recently, imaging of serotonin 1A receptors, may provide additional data to explain overlapping clinical manifestations of epilepsy and depression.
