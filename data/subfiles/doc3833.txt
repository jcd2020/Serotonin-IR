	1 On the basis of previous findings that cannabinoids inhibit the function of human and rat 5-HT3 receptors in vitro, we investigated whether cannabinoid receptor agonists also modulate the activity of the rat peripheral 5-HT3 receptors on the terminals of cardiopulmonary afferent C-fibres in vivo. 2 In urethane-anaesthetized rats, pre-treated intravenously (i.v.) with the CB, receptor antagonist SR 141716A (3 mumol kg(-1)) and with the beta(1)/beta(2) adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (0.3-0.4 mumol kg(-1)), bolus injection of the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor agonist phenylbiguanide (310 mug kg(-1), i.v.) or the vanilloid VR1 receptor agonist capsaicin (3-10 mug kg(-1), i.v.) caused an immediate decrease in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure (the von Bezold-Jarisch reflex). 3 The phenylbiguanide-induced bradycardia was dose-dependently attenuated by the cannabinoid receptor agonists CP 55,940 (0.1-1 mumol kg(-1), i.v.) and WIN 55,212-2 (0.1-3 mumol kg(-1), i.v.) 20 min after injection, but not by the inactive S-(-)enantiomer of the latter, WIN 55,212-3 (1 mumol kg(-1), i.v.). The inhibition was reversible within 30 min. The extent of inhibition by the highest doses of cannabinoid receptor agonists amounted to about 50%. Both cannabinoid receptor agonists failed to affect the capsaicin-evoked bradycardia. 4 In conclusion, our results demonstrate that cannabinoid receptor agonists modulate the von Bezold-Jarisch reflex by inhibiting peripheral serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in rats in vivo. An analogous mechanism of cannabinoid receptor agonists may be assumed to be involved in other serotonin 5-HT3 receptor-mediated responses.
