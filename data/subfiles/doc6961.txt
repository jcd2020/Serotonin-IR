Kusumi, I., et al. (2000). "Differential effects of subchronic treatments with atypical antipsychotic drugs on dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the rat brain." J Neural Transm 107(3): 295-302.

	The effects of 3-week treatment with a typical antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine and three atypical antipsychotic drugs (risperidone, olanzapine and perospirone) on the binding to dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors were examined in the rat stratum and frontal cortex, respectively. Subchronic treatment with chlorpromazine (10 mg/kg) and perospirone (1 mg/kg) significantly increased D-2 receptors, while no increase was observed with lower dose of chlorpromazine (5 mg/kg), perospirone (0.1 mg/kg), risperidone (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) or olanzapine (1, 2 mg/kg). On the other hand, 3-week administration of chlorpromazine (5, 10 mg/kg) and olanzapine (1, 2 mg/kg) significantly decreased 5-HT2A receptors, but risperidone (0.25, 0.5 mg/kg) or perospirone (0.1, 1 mg/kg) had no effect. The measurement of in vivo drug occupation for D-2 and 5-HT2A receptors using N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ)) suggested that high occupation of 5-HT2A receptors with lower D-2 receptor occupancy might be involved in the absence of up-regulation of D-2 receptors after subchronic treatment with some atypical antipsychotic drugs.
