Watanabe, M., et al. (1998). "Effect of chronic amitriptyline administration on serotonergic receptors in rats with methylazoxymethanol-induced microencephaly." Brain Res 787(2): 333-336.

	Methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-induced cortical hypoplasia resulted in a 20% decrease in the Bmax of 5-HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex with no change in the Bmax of 5-HT1A receptors. Chronic treatment with amitriptyline did not further decrease the Bmax of 5-HT2A receptors in the MAM-lesioned cortex, suggesting that the persistent down-regulation of cortical 5-HT2A receptors in MAM-lesioned rats was induced by serotonergic hyperinnervation.
