Gunther, L., et al. (2010). "A diverse development of 5-HT1A receptor binding is relevant to behavioral differences observed in adult mice of two genetically closely related inbred strains." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 97(2): 273-278.

	Only few genetic loci were supposed to be crucial for strong behavioral differences, especially in locomotion and aggression, in two closely related mice inbred strains: AB/Halle (ABH) and AB/Gatersleben (ABC). Previously we reported remarkable strain differences in 5-HT1A receptor binding in adult mice. In the present study, we were interested if the strain-specific 5-HT1A receptor binding pattern is already present very early in ontogeny which could indirectly hint at a gene that is differentially regulated in these 2 mouse strains. Since the 5-HT1A receptor is involved in the regulation of locomotion and aggression, one genetic determinate for the behavioral differences in ABH and ABC mice would have been found. Therefore, we measured [H-3]8-OH-DPAT specific binding at postnatal day (PND) 1 and 21 (weanlings) using in vitro autoradiography. 5-HT1A receptor binding was not significantly different at PND 1 between strains. However, in weanlings the same 5-HT1A receptor binding pattern was observed as in adults, i.e. ABH mice display a higher forebrain 5-HT1A receptor binding compared to ABC mice. So the strain-specific forebrain 5-HT1A receptor binding pattern develops during the first 3 postnatal weeks and genetically driven mechanisms seem to be crucial. However, early environmental influences, e.g. differences in maternal care, can't be excluded. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
