	Previously, we found that 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD) model mice (PD mice) showed facilitation of hippocampal memory extinction via reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)/cAMP-dependent response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling, which may cause cognitive impairment in PD. Serotonergic neurons in the median raphe nucleus (MnRN) project to the hippocampus, and functional abnormalities have been reported. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor (5-HT(4)R) agonists prucalopride and velusetrag on the facilitation of memory extinction observed in PD mice. Both 5-HT(4)R agonists restored facilitation of contextual fear extinction in PD mice by stimulating the cAMP/CREB pathway in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. A retrograde fluorogold-tracer study showed that Î³-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) neurons in the reticular part of the substantia nigra (SNr), but not dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), projected to serotonergic neurons in the MnRN, which are known to project their nerve terminals to the hippocampus. It is possible that the degeneration of the SNpc DAergic neurons in PD mice affects the SNr GABAergic neurons, and thereafter, the serotonergic neurons in the MnRN, resulting in hippocampal dysfunction. These findings suggest that 5HT4R agonists could be potentially useful as therapeutic drugs for treating cognitive deficits in PD.
