Gurguis, G. N. M., et al. (1999). "Coupling efficiency of brain beta-adrenergic receptors to G(s) protein in suicide, alcoholism and control subjects." Psychopharmacology 145(1): 31-38.

	Abnormal beta-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) density in the brains of suicide victims has been reported, although results of studies are inconsistent. Ethanol modifies beta AR-mediated signal transduction. Moreover abnormal beta AR function has been implicated in alcoholism. beta AR antagonists, which were used as ligands in previous beta AR binding studies, also bind to 5-HT1B/1D beta receptors; hence, their estimates of beta AR density are confounded by binding to 5-HT1B/1D beta receptors. More importantly, previous studies did not examine beta AR agonist affinity or coupling efficiency to G(s) protein. We investigated agonist affinity and coupling efficiency of beta AR to G(s) protein in the brains of ten suicide victims, six subjects with alcoholism, and eight controls. There were no differences in beta AR density in either the frontal cortex or hippocampus of suicide victims or alcoholic subjects compared to controls, Preliminary results indicate beta AR supercoupling in suicide victims in both brain regions and uncoupling in alcoholic subjects in the frontal cortex. These results are discussed in view of the existing literature on the role of beta AR in suicide and alcoholism and the mechanism of action of antidepressants.
