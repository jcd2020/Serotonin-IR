Devos, H., et al. (1991). "(H-3) RAUWOLSCINE BEHAVES AS AN AGONIST FOR THE 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN HUMAN FRONTAL-CORTEX MEMBRANES." European Journal of Pharmacology-Molecular Pharmacology Section 207(1): 1-8.

	The alpha-2 adrenergic antagonist [H-3]rauwolscine binds with comparable nonomolar affinity to alpha-2 adrenoceptors and the nonadrenergic 5-HT1A receptor sites in human frontal cortex membranes. Addition of 0.5 mM GTP into the incubation medium produces a significant decrease in the amount of [H-3]rauwolscine binding sites (B(max) = 230 +/- 16 and 115 +/- 11 fmol/mg protein in the absence and presence of GTP, respectively). The affinity for [H-3]rauwolscine remains unchanged (i.e. K(D) = 40 +/- 0.9 nM and 4.1 +/- 1 nM). This effect of GTP can be attributed to decreased binding of the radioligand to the 5-HT1A receptors. GTP decreases binding of [H-3]rauwolscine to nearly the same level as the one corresponding to the alpha-2 adrenoceptors in membranes from both the human frontal cortex and hippocampus. The venom of the marine cone snail, Conus tessulatus, preferentially inhibits [H-3]rauwolscine binding to 5-HT1A receptors as compared with the alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Following complete masking of the 5-HT1A receptors by this venom, GTP no longer affects the saturation binding characteristics of [H-3]rauwolscine for the remaining alpha-2 adrenoceptors. Nucleotides decrease the binding of [H-3]rauwolscine to the 5-HT1A receptors with an order of potencies (i.e. GTP-gamma-S > GPP(NH)P >> GDP > GTP >> ATP) that is typical for nucleotide-mediated receptor-G protein dissociation. This suggests that [H-3]rauwolscine is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and this conclusion is compatible with earlier functional studies, indicating that rauwolscine (as well as yohimbine) has agonistic properties at the level of 5-HT autoreceptors. [H-3]RX821002 is a newly developed radiolabelled antagonist which possesses about 10-fold higher affinity for the alpha-2 adrenoceptors than for the 5-HT1A receptors. At low concentrations, this radioligand mainly labels the alpha-2 adrenoceptors and GTP (as well as 5-HT) has only little effect on its saturation binding characteristics.
