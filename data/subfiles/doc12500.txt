	The anti-emetic profile of the novel brain penetrant tachykinin NK1 receptor antagonist MK-0869 (L-754,030) 2-(R)-(1-(R)-(3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylethoxy)-3-(S)-(4-fluor o)phenyl-4-(3-oxo-1,2,4-triazol-5-yl)methylmorpholine and its water soluble prodrug, L-758,298, has been examined against emesis induced by cisplatin in ferrets. In a 4 h observation period, MK-0869 and L-758,298 (3 mg/kg i.v. or p.o.) inhibited the emetic response to cisplatin (10 mg/kg i.v.). The anti-emetic protection afforded by MK-0869 (0.1 mg/kg i.v.) was enhanced by combined treatment with either dexamethasone (20 mg/kg i.v.) or the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (0.1 mg/kg i.v.). In a model of acute and delayed emesis, ferrets were dosed with cisplatin (5 mg/kg i.p.) and the retching and vomiting response recorded for 72 h. Pretreatment with MK-0869 (4-16 mg/kg p.o.) dose-dependently inhibited the emetic response to cisplatin. Once daily treatment with MK-0869 (2 and 4 mg/kg p.o.) completely prevented retching and vomiting in all ferrets tested. Further when daily dosing began at 24 h after cisplatin injection, when the acute phase of emesis had already become established, MK-0869 (4 mg/kg p.o. at 24 and 48 h after cisplatin) prevented retching and vomiting in three out of four ferrets. These data show that MK-0869 and its prodrug, L-758,298, have good activity against cisplatin-induced emesis in ferrets and provided a basis for the clinical testing of these agents for the treatment of emesis associated with cancer chemotherapy.
