Subhash, M. N., et al. (1998). "Inactivation of 5-HT1A and [3H]5-HT binding sites by N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1, 2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) in rat brain." Neurochem Res 23(10): 1321-1326.

	Inactivation of 5-HT1A and [3H]5-HT binding sites by N-Ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1, 2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) was studied in regions of rat brain. After exposure to EEDQ (4 mg/kg body wt.) for 7 days, it is observed that the density of 5-HT1 receptor sites was decreased by nearly 20% in both cortex and hippocampus. The decrease, however, in 5-HT1A sites was more significant (70%) in both the regions. The affinity of [3H]5-HT to 5-HT1 sites was decreased significantly in both cortex and hippocampus after exposure to EEDQ, without affecting the Kd of 5-HT1A sites. Displacement studies suggested that EEDQ has high affinity to 5-HT1 sites with a Ki of 42.9+/-2.4 nM. After exposure neither basal nor 5-HT stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was changed in cortex. The results of this study suggest that EEDQ decreases the density of 5-HT1 and 5-HT1A receptor sites but does not cause functional downregulation of these sites in rat brain.
