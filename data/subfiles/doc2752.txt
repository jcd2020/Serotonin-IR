	This study investigated the central hypotensive effects of drugs that possess a high affinity for central 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) binding sites; (+)8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), N,N-dipropylcarboxamidotryptamine (DP-5-CT), erythro-1-(1-[2(1,4-benzodioxan-2-yl)-2-hydroxyethyl]- 4-piperidyl)-2-benzimidazolinone (R28935) and urapidil proved to possess high affinity and selectivity for central 5-HT1A binding sites, labeled by [3H]8-OH-DPAT. (+)8-OH-DPAT (0.1-10 micrograms/kg) given through the left vertebral artery of chloralose-anesthetized cats, lowered blood pressure by a biphasic dose-response curve. When given systemically, 10- to 100-fold higher doses of (+)8-OH-DPAT were necessary to obtain the same hypotensive effect when compared with central administration. Besides 8-OH-DPAT, R28935, DP-5-CT and urapidil also lowered blood pressure by a central mechanism in doses that were ineffective when given systemically. The central hypotensive effect of 0.3 micrograms/kg (+)8-OH-DPAT, 3 micrograms/kg DP-5 CT, and 3 micrograms/kg R28935 could be blocked by 100 micrograms/kg (-)pindolol, indicating that central 5-HT1A receptors are involved. High doses of (+)8-OH-DPAT (3-10 micrograms/kg) can also lower blood pressure by activating central alpha 2-adrenoceptors. The hypotensive effect of 300 micrograms/kg urapidil given through the vertebral artery could not be blocked by (-)pindolol. These results indicate the involvement of central 5-HT1A receptors in the mechanism of the central hypotensive activity of (+)8-OH-DPAT, DP-5-CT, and R28935.
