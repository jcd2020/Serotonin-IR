	Neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and ions regulate glycogen levels in the brain by modulating the activity of glycogen synthase (GSase) and glycogen phosphorylase (GPase). GPase is co-localized with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astroglia-specific marker, suggesting that glycogen is localized in astroglial cells. Additionally, functional serotonin (5-HT) receptors are found in both neurons and glia, and 5-HT is known to stimulate glycogenolysis. It is reported that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a drug of abuse, stimulates the release and inhibits the reuptake of 5-HT, and selectively inhibits the activity of MAO-A. These biochemical consequences of MDMA lead to increased extra-cellular 5-HT levels. This study investigates the effects of MDMA(+) and serotonin (5-HT) on glycogen metabolism in the rat brain. A histochemical method was designed to visualize active glycogen phosphorylase (GPase) in an astroglial-rich primary culture. Serotonin activated GPase in a concentration-dependent manner (100 nM-100 microM). Maximal activation by 5-HT was achieved by 50 microM and resulted in a 167% increase in the number of reactive sites (P < 0.001). MDMA(+) (500 nM-50 microM) directly stimulated GPase activity with maximal activation induced by 5 microM, which caused a 70% increase in the number of reactive sites (P < 0.001). The 5-HT2 receptor agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOB), also displayed a concentration-dependent increase in the number of GPase reactive sites. Maximal stimulation by DOB occurred at 100 nM which increased the number of reactive sites by 166% (P < 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
