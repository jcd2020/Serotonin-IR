	Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin hormone with a number of functions to maintain energy homeostasis and contribute to motivated behavior, both peripherally and within the central nervous system (CNS). These functions, which include insulin secretion, gastric emptying, satiety, and the hedonic aspects of food and drug intake, are primarily mediated through stimulation of the GLP-1 receptor. While this receptor plays an important role in a variety of physiological outcomes, data regarding its CNS expression has been primarily limited to regional receptor binding and single-label transcript expression studies. We thus developed a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse, in which expression of a red fluorescent protein (mApple) is driven by the GLP-1R promoter. Using this reporter mouse, we characterized the regional and cellular expression patterns of GLP-1R expressing cells in the CNS, using double-label immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. GLP-1R-expressing cells were enriched in several key brain regions and circuits, including the lateral septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, hippocampus, ventral midbrain, periaqueductal gray, and cerebral cortex. In most regions, GLP-1R primarily colocalized with GABAergic neurons, except within some regions such as the hippocampus, where it was co-expressed in glutamatergic neurons. GLP-1R-mApple cells were highly co-expressed with 5-HT3 receptor-containing neurons within the cortex and striatum, as well as with dopamine receptor- and calbindin-expressing cells within the lateral septum, the brain region in which GLP-1R is most highly expressed. In this manuscript, we provide detailed images of GLP-1R-mApple expression and distribution within the brain and characterization of these neurons.
