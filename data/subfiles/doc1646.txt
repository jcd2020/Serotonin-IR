Carli, M. and R. Samanin (1992). "8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-NORMAL-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN IMPAIRS SPATIAL-LEARNING IN A WATER MAZE - ROLE OF POSTSYNAPTIC 5-HT1A RECEPTORS." British Journal of Pharmacology 105(3): 720-726.

	1 The effect of 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, on place navigation was studied by use of two spatial tasks in a water maze. 2 In the first experiment, rats treated subcutaneously with 100 and 300 (but not 30)-mu-g kg-1 8-OH-DPAT were impaired in their ability to locate a hidden platform. The probe test confirmed the impairment of spatial navigation but the effect (time spent in the training quadrant) was quantitatively different, depending on whether 8-OH-DPAT was administered only before each training session, only before the probe test or in both conditions. 3 In the second experiment, rats received 150-mu-g 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) intracerebroventricularly to destroy 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-containing neurones and 24 days later were examined for choice accuracy in a two-platform spatial discrimination task. 4 At 100 (but not 30)-mu-g kg-1 8-OH-DPAT impaired rats' accuracy with no effect on latency and no errors of omission. In 5,7-DHT-treated rats, this dose had a greater effect, including errors of omission. Sham-operated rats injected with 300-mu-g kg-1 8-OH-DPAT were markedly impaired in accuracy but they had longer latencies and made more errors than controls. All the effects were increased in 5,7-DHT treated rats. 5 The results suggest that, at doses causing no apparent changes in motor behaviour or motivation, 8-OH-DPAT impairs spatial navigation by stimulating postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the rat brain.
