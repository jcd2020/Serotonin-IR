Kennett, G. A., et al. (1998). "Anxiolytic-like actions of BW 723C86 in the rat Vogel conflict test are 5-HT2B receptor mediated." Neuropharmacology 37(12): 1603-1610.

	The 5-HT2B receptor agonist, BW 723C86 (10, 30 mg/kg i.p. 30 min pre-test), increased the number of punishments accepted in a rut Vogel drinking conflict paradigm over 3 min, as did the benzodiazepine anxiolytics, chlordiazepoxide (2.5-10 mg,kg p.o. h pre-test) and alprazolam (0.2-5 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test), but not the 5-HT2C/2B receptor agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.3-3 mg/kg i.p) or the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, buspirone (5-20 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test). The effect Of BW 723C86 was unlikely to be secondary to enhanced thirst, as RW 723C86 did not increase the time that rats with free access to water spent drinking, nor did. it rt duce sensitivity to shock in the apparatus. The anti-punishment effect of BW 723C86 was opposed bq prior treatment with the 5-HT2C/2B receptor antagonist, SB-206553 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test, and the selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist, SB-215505 (1 and 3 mg/kg p.o. 1 h pre-test), but not by the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, SB-242084 (5 mg/kg p.o.), or the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg s.c. 30 min pre-test). Thus, the anti-punishment action of BW 723C86 is likely to be 5-HT2B receptor mediated. This is consistent with previous reports that BW 723C86 exhibited anxiolytic-like properties in both the social interaction and Geller-Seifter conflict tests. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.
