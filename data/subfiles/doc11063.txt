Tissier, M. H., et al. (1993). "EFFECTS OF IPSAPIRONE, A 5-HT(1A) AGONIST, ON SLEEP-WAKEFULNESS CYCLES - PROBABLE POSTSYNAPTIC ACTION." Journal of Sleep Research 2(2): 103-109.

	The effects of ipsapirone, a ligand of the 5-HT1A receptors and a new potential anxiolytic, on sleep/wakefulness regulation were examined in the rat. Injected i.p. at 1, 3 and 5 mg kg-1, this compound induced a dose-dependent reduction of paradoxical sleep for 2 to 4 hours, followed, at a dose of 5 mg kg-1, by a secondary rebound. The other states of vigilance were not modified, except at the latter dose where the amounts of wakefulness were enhanced initially and decreased secondarily, while those of SWS were enhanced from 2 to 4 hours post-treatment. The effects of ipsapirone (3 mg kg-1) persisted after infusion of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the dorsal raphe nucleus which induced the sub-total destruction of the serotoninergic system. Thus, the action of the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone on sleep/wakefulness cycles probably involves the stimulation of the post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors.
