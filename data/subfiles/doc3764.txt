Giovacchini, G., et al. (2009). "Using Cerebral White Matter for Estimation of Nondisplaceable Binding of 5-HT1A Receptors in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy." Journal of Nuclear Medicine 50(11): 1794-1800.

	The estimation of nondisplaceable binding from cerebellar white matter, rather than from whole cerebellum, was proposed for the PET tracer carbonyl-C-11-WAY-100635 (N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl}-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexane-carboxamidel]) because of the heterogeneity of total ligand binding in this region. For the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (5-HT1A) antagonist F-18-N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}-N-2-pyridyl)trans-4-fluorocyclohexanecarboxamide (F-18-FCWAY), the estimation of nondisplaceable binding from cerebellum (V-ND) may be additionally biased by spillover of F-18-fluoride activity from skull. We aimed to assess the effect of using cerebral white matter as reference region on detection of group differences in 5-HT1A binding with PET and F-18-FCWAY. Methods: In 22 temporal lobe epilepsy patients (TLE) and 10 healthy controls, F-18-FCWAY distribution volume in cerebral white matter (V-WM) was computed using an extrapolation method as part of a partial-volume correction (PVC) algorithm. To assess the feasibility of applying this method to clinical studies in which PVC is not performed, V-WM was also calculated by placing circular, 6-mm-diameter regions of interest (ROIs) in the centrum semiovalis on parametric images. Binding potentials were BPF = (V-T-V-ND)/f(P) and BPF-WM = (V-T-V-WM)/f(P), where V-T is total distribution volume and f(P) = F-18-FCWAY plasma free fraction. Statistical analysis was performed using t tests and linear regression. Results: In the whole group, V-WM was 14% +/- 19% lower than V-ND (P < 0.05). V-WM/f(P) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in patients than in controls. All significant (P < 0.05) reductions of 5-HT1A receptor availability in TLE patients detected by BPF were also detected using BPF-WM. Significant (P < 0.05) reductions of 5-HT1A specific binding were detected by BPF-WM, but not BPF, in ipsilateral inferior temporal cortex, contralateral fusiform gyrus, and contralateral amygdala. However, effect sizes were similar for BPF-WM and BPF. The value of V-WM calculated with the ROI approach did not significantly (P > 0.05) differ from that calculated with the extrapolation approach (0.67 +/- 0.32 mL/mL and 0.72 +/- 0.34 mL/mL, respectively). Conclusion: Cerebral white matter can be used for the quantification of nondisplaceable binding of 5-HT1A without loss of statistical power for detection of regional group differences. The ROI approach is a good compromise between computational complexity and sensitivity to spillover of activity, and it appears suitable to studies in which PVC is not performed. For F-18-FCWAY, this approach has the advantage of avoiding spillover of F-18-fluoride activity onto the reference region.
