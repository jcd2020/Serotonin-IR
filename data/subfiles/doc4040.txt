	Serotonin (1-40 mu M) reduced input resistance by 20.6 +/- 6% and hyperpolarized stellate and pyramidal neurons of layers two and three of the lateral entorhinal cortex. 5-Carboxamidotryptamine, a 5-HT1 agonist, and the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin mimicked the action of serotonin. The reversal potential of 5-HT-mediated hyperpolarizations was sensitive to the extracellular K+ concentration, indicating a potassium conductance change. Serotonin treatment suppressed excitatory amino acid-mediated synaptic potentials (by 48%, K-d = 6.9 mu M) and responses to exogenously applied glutamate (70.1 +/- 17% of control, n = 7), but did not alter paired-pulse facilitation, indicating a postsynaptic site of action. Intracellular application of QX-314, a blocker of potassium conductance, significantly reduced depression of synaptic potentials by 5-HT agonists. In cells filled with QX-314, responses to exogenously applied glutamate were not reduced by serotonin or 5-carboxamidotryptamine application. These results indicate that the observed conductance increase associated with 5-HT application accounts for most if not all of the observed depressant effects of 5-HT1A agonists on excitatory amino acid-mediated neurotransmission.
