	Electrical or chemical stimulation of the superior colliculus (SC) in rats produces orienting and defensive responses. Defensive behaviors are modulated by serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT), and serotonergic fibers provide a dense innervation of the SC. Here, we examined the role of 5-HT in modulating the behavioral responses of rats elicited by electrical SC stimulation. Low-intensity (107 +/- 12 muA) stimulation of the SC elicited orienting head movements, while higher intensities (204 +/- 20 muA) produced running and jumping responses. Treatment with the 5-HT depletor p-chlorophenylalanine (300 mg/kg/day x 3, i.p.) lowered current thresholds to elicit orienting and running by 40 and 21%, respectively. Conversely, concurrent administration of the 5-HT uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (10mg/kg, i.p.) and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.) increased threshold currents to produce head and running movements by 41 and 18%, respectively. We investigated the anatomical substrate of this inhibitory effect of 5-HT with intracerebral 5-HT application by means of reverse microdialysis. Application of 5-HT (1-50mM) into the midbrain immediately adjacent to the SC stimulation electrode resulted in a pronounced (approximately four-fold for 50 mM 5-HT) dose- and time-dependent increase in stimulation thresholds to elicit head movements. Application of 5-HT into the frontal cortex (up to 100 mM) had no significant effect on SC-evoked behavioral responses. These results show that 5-HT exerts an inhibitory influence over orienting and defensive behaviors initiated in the mammalian SC. It appears that this inhibitory effect is mediated, to a large extent, by a direct action of 5-HT at the level of the midbrain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
