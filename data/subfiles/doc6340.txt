	Evidence suggests that compounds possessing both norepinephrine reuptake inhibition and 5-HT(1A) partial agonism (NRI/5-HT(1A)) activities may have a greater efficacy in treating neuropsychiatric disorders than compounds possessing either activity alone. The objectives of the present study were first to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of the plasma concentrations of atomoxetine (NRI) and buspirone (5-HT(1A) partial agonist), administered alone and in combination, on the prefrontal cortex dopamine levels in rats, and second to use the model developed to characterize the PK/PD relationship of novel NRI/5-HT(1A) compounds, PF-04269339 and PF-03529936, in a NRI/5-HT(1A) drug discovery program. Maximal dopamine elevation was twofold higher after administration of atomoxetine and buspirone in combination, PF-04269339, or PF-03529936 than after administration of atomoxetine or buspirone alone. A mechanism-based extended indirect response model characterized the time profiles of the prefrontal cortex dopamine response to atomoxetine and buspirone, administered alone or in combination. After fixing three mechanism-specific pharmacodynamic parameters (I (max) and γ2 for NRI and γ1 for 5-HT(1A)) based on the model for atomoxetine and/or buspirone, the model fitted the exposure-response profiles of PF-04269339 and PF-03529936 well. Good in vitro-to-in vivo correlation was demonstrated with the compound-specific pharmacodynamic parameters (IC(50) for NRI and SC(50) and S (max) for 5-HT(1A)) across the compounds. In summary, a piecewise modeling approach was used successfully for the characterization of the PK/PD relationship of novel NRI/5-HT(1A) compounds on prefrontal cortex dopamine levels in rats. The application and value of the mechanism-based modeling in the dual pharmacology drug discovery program are also discussed.
