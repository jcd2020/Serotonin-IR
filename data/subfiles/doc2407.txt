Dawson, L. A., et al. (2000). "In vivo effects of the 5-HT6 antagonist SE-271046 on striatal and frontal cortex extracellular concentrations of noradrenaline, dopamine, 5-HT, glutamate and aspartate." British Journal of Pharmacology 130(1): 23-26.

	Although the 5-HT6 receptor subtype was identified some 5 years ago, very little is known about its function within the brain. Here we demonstrate, for the first time, the neurochemical effects of a selective 5-HT6 receptor ligand. Using in vivo microdialysis in the freely moving rat, we evaluated the effects of the selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist SB-271046 by simultaneous measurement of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), dopamine (DA), noradrenaline (NA), glutamate and aspartate from the striatum and frontal cortex. SB-271045 did not alter basal levels of 5-HT, DA and NA in either brain region. Similarly, there was no change basal levels of either of the excitatory amino acids within the striatum. In contrast, administration of SE-271046 (10 mg kg(-1) s.c.) produced a significant (P < 0.05), tetrodotoxin-dependent, increase in extracellular levels of both glutamate and aspartate within the frontal cortex, reaching maximum values of 375.4 +/- 82.3 and 215.3 +/- 62.1% of preinjection; values, respectively.
