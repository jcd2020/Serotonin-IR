Sevoz-Couche, C., et al. (2000). "In vivo modulation of vagal-identified dorsal medullary neurones by activation of different 5-hydroxytryptamine(2) receptors in rats." Br J Pharmacol 131(7): 1445-1453.

	1 In in vivo experiments, DOI (a 5-HT2 receptor agonist), MK-212 (a 5-HT2C receptor agonist), and BW-723C86 (a 5-HT2B receptor agonist) were applied by ionophoresis to neurones in the rat nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) receiving vagal afferent input. 2 The majority of the putative 'monosynaptically' vagal activated cells were inhibited by both MK-212 (4/6) and DOI (2/4), but unaffected by BW-723C86 (12/14). In contrast, 'polysynaptically' activated NTS cells were excited by both BW-723C86 (13/19) and DOI (9/10). Inactive 'intermediate' cells were inhibited by BW-723C86 (9/12), MK-212 (5/6) and DOT (3/4), whilst active cells of this group were excited by BW-723C86 (7/13) and DOI (5/5). 3 The selective 5-HT2B receptor antagonist LY-202715 significantly reduced the excitatory actions of BW-723C86 on 'intermediate' and 'polysynaptic' cells (13/13), but not the inhibitory effects observed on inactive Group 2 cells (n=5) whereas the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist RS-102221 reversed the inhibitory effects of MK-212 and DOI on 'monosynaptic and 'intermediate' neurones. 4 Cardio-pulmonary afferent stimulation inhibited two of four putative 'monosynaptically' activated calls and all four inactive intermediate cells. These were also inhibited by DOI and MK-212. In contrast, cardio-pulmonary afferents excited all five active intermediate cells and all six putative 'polysynaptically' activated NTS cells, while all were also previously excited by BW-723C86 and/or DOI. 5 In conclusion, these data demonstrate that neurones in the NTS are affected differently by 5-HT2 receptor ligands, in regard of their vagal postsynaptic location, the type of cardio-pulmonary afferent they receive and the different 5-HT2 receptors activated.
