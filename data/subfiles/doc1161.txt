	An additional component of the depolarization induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) in the rat isolated vagus nerve has recently been attributed to activation of 5-HT4 receptors. To confirm and extend this finding, extracellular recordings of D.C. potentials were made using the 'grease-gap' technique during continuous superfusion of the isolated nerve. Beginning at 1 nM, 5-HT induced small depolarizations that displayed a slow onset. At concentrations greater than or equal to 1 mu M, large depolarizations with rapid onset were elicited. In the presence of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, granisetron or ondansetron, 5-HT responses were diminished and exhibited an increased latency to peak. These small, slow depolarizations were not reduced by 5-HT1 or 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, but were potently inhibited by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist GR 113808 (pA(2) = 9.3), and mimicked by 5-methoxytryptamine (pEC(50) = 5.3). 5-HT4-mediated responses were larger at 37 degrees C than at 31 degrees C, but also showed marked diminution with repeated 5-HT applications at concentrations greater than 1 mu M. Conversely, 5-HT3 receptor responses were potentiated at lower temperatures (less than or equal to 31 degrees C). Consistent with the reported positive coupling of 5-HT4 receptors to adenylyl cyclase, forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP produced slowly developing depolarizations which were qualitatively similar to 5-HT4 receptor activation: Pre-depolarization of nerves with 10 mu M forskolin or 300 mu M 8-Br-cAMP diminished the effect of 5-HT4 receptors. This study has confirmed the presence of 5-HT4 receptors on the vagus nerve of the rat and defined some conditions that optimize their pharmacological isolation. The rat isolated vagus nerve constitutes a simple and robust preparation for studying 5-HT4 receptors in the peripheral nervous system.
