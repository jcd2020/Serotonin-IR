Fletcher, S. and N. M. Barnes (1999). "Autoradiographic localization of the [3H]-(S)-zacopride labelled 5-HT3 receptor in porcine brain." Neurosci Lett 269(2): 91-94.

	Using the technique of in vitro receptor autoradiography, we have determined the distribution of the [3H]-(S)-zacopride labelled 5-HT3 receptor in porcine brain. Highest densities of 5-HT3 receptor-associated [3H]-(S)-zacopride binding were detected in areas of porcine spinal cord, nodose ganglion, trigeminal nerve nucleus, area postrema and cerebral cortex, with relatively lower levels in other brain regions (e.g. hippocampus, caudate-putamen). The distribution of [3H]-(S)-zacopride binding in porcine forebrain provides further evidence for inter-species differences with respect to the differential expression of the 5-HT3 receptor in the forebrain.
