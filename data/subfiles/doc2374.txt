	A series of experiments examined the effects of 5-HT1A ligands alone and in combination with the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine on short term working memory in the rat. The behavioural paradigm was a discrete trial, operant delayed matching to position task, with delays of 0, 5, 15 and 30 s. The 5-HT1A ligands tested were the full agonist, 8-OH DPAT (0, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg), the partial agonist, ipsapirone (0, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg), and the purported antagonist, NAN 190 (0, 1, 2, and 4 mg/kg). 1-PP (O, 0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg), the major metabolite of ipsapirone, was also tested. The lowest dose of 8-OH DPAT significantly improved matching accuracy at the longest delay, whereas the highest dose impaired matching accuracy and increased the latency to respond. Ipsapirone also significantly improved the accuracy of performance at a dose of 3 mg/kg, but the doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg did not significantly affect performance. NAN-190, at the highest dose tested (4 mg/kg), impaired matching accuracy, whereas the two lower doses did not significantly affect performance. The highest dose also increased the latency to respond. 1-PP had no effect on performance. Scopolamine HBr (0.14 mg/kg) caused a delay dependent: impairment in matching accuracy, and had no effect on missed trials or the latency to respond. Low doses of 8-OH DPAT (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the scopolamine induced accuracy impairment, whereas 1 mg/kg 8-OH DPAT potentiated the impairment. Ipsapirone (3 mg/kg) also significantly improved the performance of scopolamine impaired rats. NAN-190 increased the latency to respond and reduced the number of nose pokes made during the delays in scopolamine-treated rats, and tended to potentiate the scopolamine-induced accuracy impairment. 1-PP did not affect the performance of scopolamine treated rats. Taken together, these results suggest that modulation of 5-HT1A receptors influences short term spatial working memory in the rat.
