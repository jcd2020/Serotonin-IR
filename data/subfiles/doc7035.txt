Masaguer, C. F., et al. (2000). "Butyrophenone analogues in the carbazole series as potential atypical antipsychotics: synthesis and determination of affinities at D(2), 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors." Eur J Med Chem 35(1): 83-95.

	We describe practical and efficient routes for synthesis of 2-aminomethyl-1,2,3,9-tetrahydro-4H-carbazol-4-ones using the Fischer indole synthesis or palladium-catalysed cyclization methodologies, as well as their affinities for D(2), 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, and their activity at the 5-HT(2B) receptor. The most active compounds, 4b (QF 2003B) and 4c (QF 2004B), with a pK(i) (5-HT(2A)/D(2)) ratio of 1.28 show a potential antipsychotic profile according to Meltzer's classification.
