Pitsikas, N., et al. (2003). "The 5-HT 1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 improves rats performance in different models of amnesia evaluated by the object recognition task." Brain Res 983(1-2): 215-222.

	The effects of the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635 on recognition memory were investigated in two different amnestic models in the rat by using the object recognition task. WAY 100635 at 1 mg/kg, but not at 0.3 mg/kg, counteracted scopolamine-induced performance deficits in the acquisition version of this behavioral paradigm. At the same dose, WAY 100635 antagonized extinction of recognition memory in the normal rat, suggesting that it affected acquisition, storage and retrieval of information. These results support and extend prior findings that interactions between the serotonergic and cholinergic systems are relevant to cognition and indicate that WAY 100635 modulates different aspects of recognition memory.
