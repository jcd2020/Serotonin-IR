	The aim of the present study was to access and compare the accuracy and reproducibility of two fully automatic and two manual methods for co-registration of structural T1-weighted MR images and functional images with localized binding. It is concluded that for functional images with distributed binding all over the brain, such as F18-FDG images, the automatic methods are preferable, while for images with localized binding, such as F18-Altanserin 5-HT2A neuroreceptor images, it is essential to use methods that handle this special problem, like the proposed manual methods.
