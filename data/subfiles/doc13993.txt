Zendehdel, M., et al. (2013). "Intracerebroventricular injection of ghrelin produces hypophagia through central serotonergic mechanisms in chicken." Vet Res Commun 37(1): 37-41.

	It has been stated that central injection of ghrelin is acting as an anorexigenic peptide in chicken. Ghrelin activity was studied through some neuronal pathways. The present study was designed in 4 experiments to examine the hypophagic response of ghrelin through the central serotonergic system in chicken. The guide cannula was surgically implanted in the right lateral ventricle of the chickens. In experiment 1, intacerebroventricular injection with PCPA (1.5 mg) performed followed by ghrelin (0.6 nmol). In experiments 2, 3 and 4 prior to ghrelin injection, chickens received fluoxetine (10 mu g), 8-OH-DPAT (15.25 nmol), SB242084 (1.5 mu g) respectively via guide cannula intacerebroventricularly. Cumulative food intake was determined at 3 h post injection. The results of this study showed that flouxetine pretreatment significantly amplified ghrelin hypophagia in chicken (p < 0.05). The hypophagic effect of ghrelin was attenuated by pretreatment with PCPA and SB242084 (p < 0.05) but 8-OH-DPAT had no effect. These results suggest that hypophagic effect of ghrelin probably is mediated by serotonergic mechanisms via 5-HT2C receptor.
