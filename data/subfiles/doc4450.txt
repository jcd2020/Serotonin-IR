	Serotonin receptors are present in lymphocytes and might be related to the functionality of these cells in health and in pathology. The serotonergic system is affected in the brain and in peripheral immune cells of depressed patients. The objectives of this work were to evaluate the basal proliferation of lymphocytes, the response to the mitogen concanavalin A, and the role of serotonin 5-HT(1A) receptors. Twenty-nine patients, 19-52 years old, were diagnosed for a major depression episode with the Statistical and Diagnostic Manual-IV of the American Psychiatric Association, approved by ethic committees and gave written consent. The Hamilton depression score was 30.60 +/- 2.65. An apparently healthy group without a family history of psychiatric illness was included. Blood peripheral lymphocytes were isolated by density gradients with Ficoll/Hypaque and differential adhesion to plastic, cultured in 96-well plaques with RPMI-1640 medium with or without 4 mug/ml of concanavalin A. 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (5-40 nM) and WAY-100,478 (0.1-100 microM), agonist and antagonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors, serotonin (12.5-100 nM) or imipramine (0.1-100 microM) were also added. Proliferation was evaluated at 72 h with 3-[4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, and the optical density was 570 nm. Basal proliferation was three times higher in depressed patients than in controls, whereas no response to mitogen was obtained, and 5-HT(1A) receptors significantly reacted to the agonist, with increases of about 31-54% at 10, 20 and 40 nM of the specific agonist, indicating initial activation probably in relation to autoimmunity and overreactivity of these receptors in depression. The antagonist reduced proliferation in mitogen-stimulated lymphocytes, 50% in controls and 70% in depressed patients, with a differential concentration dependency; probably, these receptors are more sensitive in depression due to increased 5-HT(1A) receptor transduction. The antagonist also reduced the stimulation produced by the 5-HT(1A) agonist. Imipramine caused biphasic effects according to concentrations, showing a possible dual role for serotonin, although all values were significantly higher in depressed subjects. The described alterations might be of relevance in the pathophysiology of depression.
