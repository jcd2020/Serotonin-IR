	The dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and the dorsal periaqueductal gray (DPAG) have been implicated in the genesis and regulation of panic-related defensive behaviors, such as escape. Previous results point to an interaction between serotonergic and opioidergic systems within the DPAG to inhibit escape, involving µ-opioid and 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1AR). In the present study we explore this interaction in the DMH, using escape elicited by electrical stimulation of this area as a panic attack index. The obtained results show that intra-DMH administration of the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (0.5 nmol) prevented the panicolytic-like effect of a local injection of serotonin (20 nmol). Pretreatment with the selective μ-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist CTOP (1 nmol) blocked the panicolytic-like effect of the 5-HT1AR agonist 8-OHDPAT (8 nmol). Intra-DMH injection of the selective MOR agonist DAMGO (0.3 nmol) also inhibited escape behavior, and a previous injection of the 5-HT1AR antagonist WAY-100635 (0.37 nmol) counteracted this panicolytic-like effect. These results offer the first evidence that serotonergic and opioidergic systems work together within the DMH to inhibit panic-like behavior through an interaction between µ-opioid and 5-HT1A receptors, as previously described in the DPAG.
