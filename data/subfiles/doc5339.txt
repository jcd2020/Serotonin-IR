	RATIONALE: The serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) system is extensively implicated in feeding behavior. In recent years, 5-HT receptors have been classified into 14 subtypes, and activation of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors inhibits food intake in rats. However, the precise functions in local brain areas of these receptor subtypes are unclear. OBJECTIVES: Frontal cortex (FC), lateral hypothalamic area (LH), or ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMH) are involved in control of feeding behavior. We investigated the effects of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptor stimulations in the three local brain areas on feeding behavior and on 5-HT metabolism. METHODS: We perfused mCPP, 5-HT(1B/2C) agonist, at multiple doses via a microdialysis probe into the three local brain areas and observed food intake. Extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA were measured simultaneously. RESULTS: Perfusion of 1 mM mCPP into VMH, but not into LH nor FC at any dose, induced significant reduction of food intake compared with control. The extracellular concentrations of 5-HT were markedly increased in all three areas, but the concentrations of 5-HIAA were not changed by mCPP perfusions. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the effects of 5-HT1B or 5-HT2C receptor activation on feeding behaviors depended on the brain regions, and that 5-HT1B or 5-HT2C receptors in VMH, but not in FC or in LH, play important roles in the regulation of food intake. The results also suggested that mCPP acts not only as a 5-HT(1B/2C) agonist, but also as a 5-HT releaser or as a re-uptake inhibitor. Further studies using antagonists should be conducted.
