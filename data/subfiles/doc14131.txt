	Skin pigmentation is a complex process controlled by many different factors. Substance P (SP) regulates many biological functions, including melanogenesis and stress. Our previous study indicated that regulation of SP on melanocyte function was mediated by neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1 receptor). Substantial evidence has accumulated that psychological stress can be associated with skin pigmentation, so that the impact of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), one of the important factors participating in stress process, on melanogenesis has also been concerned. It has been reported that 5-HT induces melanin synthesis via 5-HT2A receptor. Furthermore, 5-HT2A receptor and NK1 receptor are G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and both expressed on melanocyte, the present study was designed to investigate whether SP has influence on the adjustment function of 5-HT. Our data demonstrated that, SP inhibited 5-HT2A receptor expression to neutralize the pro-melanogenesis effect of 5-HT on B16F10 cells. The up-regulation of NK1 receptor expression was simultaneous with the down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptor treated by SP. This inhibition of 5-HT2A receptor expression by SP could be reversed by NK1 receptor antagonist Spantide I. Our studies indicated that SP could directly induce 616F10 cells apoptosis in vitro. 5-HT and 5-HT2A receptor agonist could mitigate this apoptotic effect of SP. It is the strong evidence of possible cross-talk between GPCRs and giving enlightenments when screening desirable drugs for target receptors. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
