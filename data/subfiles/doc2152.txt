	A series of novel compounds with two halogen substituents have been designed and synthesized to further optimize the 2-phenylcyclopropylmethylamine scaffold in the quest for drug-like 5-HT2C agonists. Compound (+)-22a was identified as a potent 5-HT2C receptor agonist, with good selectivity against the 5-HT2B and the 5-HT2A receptors. ADMET assays showed that compound (+)-22a possessed desirable properties in terms of its microsomal stability, and CYP and hERG inhibition, along with an excellent brain penetration profile. Evaluation of (+)-22a in animal models of schizophrenia-related behaviors revealed that it had a desirable activity profile, as it reduced d-amphetamine-stimulated hyperlocomotion in the open field test, it restored d-amphetamine-disrupted prepulse inhibition, it induced cognitive improvements in the novel object recognition memory test in NR1-KD animals, and it produced very little catalepsy relative to haloperidol. These data support the further development of (+)-22a as a drug candidate for the treatment of schizophrenia.
