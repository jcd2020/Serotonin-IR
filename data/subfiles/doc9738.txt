	1 This study describes the in vitro interaction of the muscarinic ligand McNeil-A-343 with two 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor subtypes, the 5-HT4 and 5-HT3 receptors, using functional as well as radioligand binding studies. 2 In the rat oesophageal muscularis mucosae, precontracted with carbachol, McNeil-A-343 was a competitive antagonist (pA(2) 6.2) of the 5-HT4 receptor which mediates the relaxation induced by 5-HT. The compound per se relaxed the oesophagus at high concentration only (greater than or equal to 10 mu M), an effect unchanged by desensitization of the 5-HT4 receptor with 10 mu M 5-methoxytryptamine. In the same preparation in the absence of tone, McNeil-A-343 displaced the carbachol concentration-response curve to the right, yielding an apparent affinity (pA(2)) of 4.9 for muscarinic receptors. 3 In the rat isolated superior cervical ganglion preparation, after blockade of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors, McNeil-A-343 caused a concentration-dependent depolarization that was unaffected by 100 nM ondansetron. The concentration-fast depolarization curve to 5-HT, mediated by the 5-HT3 receptor, was displaced to the right by McNeil-A-343, which showed an apparent affinity (pA(2)) of 4.8 for the 5-HT3 subtype. 4 In binding studies, McNeil-A-343 recognized a single population of 5-HT4 receptors in pig caudate nucleus, with a pK(1) of 5.9. The binding affinity of McNeil-A-343 for 5-HT3 receptors in NG 108-15 cells was approximately four times lower (pK(1) 5.3). Binding affinities (pK(1)) for muscarinic receptor subtypes in rat tissues were 5.3 (M(1), cortex), 5.2 (M(2), heart) and 4.9 (M(3), submandibular glands), respectively. 5 McNeil-A-343 is an antagonist at 5-HT4 and 5-HT3 receptors; the interaction of the compound with these receptor subtypes (notably the 5-HT4) occurs in a range of concentrations which generally overlaps that relevant to the interaction with muscarinic receptors.
