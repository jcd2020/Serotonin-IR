Kennett, G. A., et al. (1987). "Single administration of 5-HT1A agonists decreases 5-HT1A presynaptic, but not postsynaptic receptor-mediated responses: relationship to antidepressant-like action." Eur J Pharmacol 138(1): 53-60.

	The 5-HT1A agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone or TVXQ 7821 (ipsapirone) but not the 5-HT1B agonist RU 24969, attenuated the hyperphagic response to 8-OH-DPAT administered on the next day. Attenuation was still apparent on the fifth day after either 8-OH-DPAT or buspirone but not on the tenth day after 8-OH-DPAT administration. The ability of 8-OH-DPAT to reduce raphe 5-HIAA levels was also impaired by previous 8-OH-DPAT treatment. However, the 8-OH-DPAT or 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine-induced 5-HT syndromes were unaltered. The results indicate that a single pretreatment with 5-HT1A agonists rapidly desensitises 5-HT1A presynaptic receptor-mediated responses. This effect may mediate the antidepressant-like action of the drugs in an animal model of depression.
