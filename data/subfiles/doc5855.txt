	For imaging CNS 5-HT3 receptors by PET, a high affinity 5-HT3 receptor ligand, endo-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-3-yl 2-(n-propyloxy)-4-quinolinecarboxylate (KF17643), have been labeled with 11C. N-Methylation of the desmethyl compound with [11C]methyl iodide followed by HPLC separation produced [11C]KF17643 with the decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 19-28%, the specific activity of 7.5-49 GBq/mumol and the radiochemical purity of > 99% at 35-40 min from EOB. After i.v. injection of [11C]KF17643 into mice, it was taken by the brain at a high level and was stable for metabolism, but no sign for the 5-HT3 receptor selectivity was found in the brain tissues by the tissue sampling and autoradiography, probably because of large non-specific binding. The [11C]KF17643 was not suitable as a PET ligand for mapping the CNS 5-HT3 receptors.
