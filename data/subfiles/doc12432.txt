Takeuchi, H., et al. (1997). "Pharmacological studies on YM992, a novel antidepressant with selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitory and 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic activity." Eur J Pharmacol 329(1): 27-35.

	YM992 ((S)-2-[[(7-fluoro-4-indanyl)oxy]methyl]morpholine monohydrochloride) is a novel compound that has selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) re-uptake inhibition and 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic activity in vivo. YM992, fluoxetine and citalopram showed 5-HT uptake inhibition activity in l-5-hydroxy-tryptophan (l-5-HTP)-treated mice. YM992 and trazodone attenuated 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist-induced head-twitches in mice, indicating that these drugs had 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic activity. YM992 and amitriptyline were highly active in the mouse tail suspension test. In contrast, fluoxetine and citalopram showed only a tendency to reduce the immobility time. Single treatment with YM992 as well as trazodone and fluoxetine ameliorated the learning deficit of olfactory-bulbectomized rats, whereas citalopram and amitriptyline showed an ameliorative effect only after chronic treatment. Although YM992 has moderate affinity for alpha1-adrenoceptors, alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonism of YM992 in vivo was 10 times weaker than that of trazodone. These results demonstrate that YM992 has 5-HT uptake inhibition and 5-HT2A receptor antagonistic activity in vivo, and suggest that YM992 may be a novel antidepressant with high efficacy in clinical use.
