Young, R. and R. A. Glennon (1992). "ZACOPRIDE AND ITS OPTICAL ISOMERS PRODUCE STEREOSELECTIVE ANTAGONISM OF A 2-METHYLSEROTONIN DISCRIMINATIVE STIMULUS." Eur J Pharmacol 212(1): 117-119.

	The serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist effects of zacopride and its optical isomers were evaluated in rats trained to discriminate 5.0 mg/kg of 2-methylserotonin (2-Me 5-HT) from saline in a 2-lever operant task. Zacopride and its enantiomers potently antagonized the 2-Me 5-HT stimulus; on the basis of 50% inhibition (ID50)) of drug lever responding the order of potency is S(-)-zacopride (ID50 = 0.05-mu-g/kg) > (+/-)-zacopride (ID50 = 0.60-mu-g/kg) > R(+)-zacopride (ID50 = 1.6-mu-g/kg). The stereoselectivity and potency ratio of zacopride's isomers for antagonizing the 2-Me 5-HT stimulus parallels their previously reported results in binding studies. It is concluded that zacopride's isomers produce antagonism of a 2-Me 5-HT stimulus by stereoselective interaction at 5-HT3 receptors and that stereochemical factors are important in evaluating the stimulus properties of 5-HT3 agents.
