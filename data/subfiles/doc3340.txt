	The present study demonstrates the presence and distribution of [3H](S)-zacopride labelled 5-HT3 (5-hydroxytryptamine3) receptors in pig forebrain. The pharmacological characterisation of 5-HT3 receptor recognition sites in homogenates of pig cerebral cortex provides further evidence for inter-species variation in the pharmacology of the 5-HT3 receptor.
