	Serotonin (5-HT) is recognized as a potential regulatory factor in neuronal development. Two subtypes of receptors for it, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C, are distributed broadly in the rat brain, suggesting their role in a variety of brain functions. Here, we investigated the expression patterns of these 5-HT2 receptors in the rat brain during postnatal development by using Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses. By Western blot analysis, the expression of the 5-HT2A receptor was at a low level at postnatal day 3 (P3) and increased greatly during the first 3 postnatal weeks; whereas the 5-HT2C receptor was already expressed at a high level at P3, and its expression increased only slightly during postnatal development. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the different expression patterns of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes during postnatal development: the transient expression of the 5-HT2C receptor was observed in layer IV of the somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices from P10 to P28, and in the thalamus, mainly in the ventral posterolateral and ventral posteromedial nuclei, from P7 to P21; however, the immunoreactivity of the 5-HT2A receptor was detectable slightly at P3, but thereafter the intensity of immunolabeling increased with postnatal development and at P21 reached the adult level and pattern. These results suggest that 5-HT2 receptors have potential significance in brain development, with a functional difference between 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes.
