Shippenberg, T. S. (1991). "CONDITIONED REINFORCING EFFECTS OF 8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO) TETRALIN - INVOLVEMENT OF 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE-1A AND D1-DOPAMINE RECEPTORS." Neurosci Lett 121(1-2): 136-138.

	A conditioned place preference paradigm was used to examine the motivational effects of the putative 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl amino)tetralin (DPAT). Rats exhibited marked preferences for an environment paired with the s.c. injection of DPAT (0.1-0.25 mg/kg): vehicle injections were without effect. Pretreatment with the 5-HT1A/D2 dopamine (DA) receptor antagonist spiperone or the D1 DA receptor antagonist SCH-23390 abolished the DPAT-induced preferences. The D2 antagonist sulpiride was without effect. These data demonstrate that DPAT is an appetitive reinforcer and that this effect results from an interaction with 5-HT1A and D1 DA receptors. They further suggest that 5HT1A agonists may have potential for abuse.
