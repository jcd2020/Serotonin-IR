	Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to affect the behaviour in animal models of depression, anxiety and avoidance learning. Lithium has marked effect in avoidance learning, an effect that can be modulated via the 5-HT system. Experiments were carried out using the conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm to investigate whether administration of NO-modifying drugs, serotonergic drugs and lithium, alone or in combination, induced or affected a CTA. The NO-precursor L-arginine (L-Arg), the non-specific inhibitor of NOS and guanylate cyclase, methylene blue (MB) and the specific NOS inhibitor 7-Nitroindazole (7-NI) all produced CTAs in a dose-dependent fashion. Furthermore, we found that L-Arg counteracted the CTAs induced by LiCl or MB but failed to modulate the CTA produced by 7-NI. The administration of the selective 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, counteracted the CTAs produced by MB and 7-NI. In contrast, depletion of 5-HT by p-Chlorophenylalanine did not affect the aversions produced by MB and 7-NI, but counteracted the CTA produced by L-Arg. Our results suggest that NO plays a role in the acquisition of the CTA induced by LiCl. Furthermore, the results suggest that the 5-HT1A receptor plays an important role in the CTA induced by MB and 7-NI, thus indicating a possible interaction between the 5-HT and NO systems.
