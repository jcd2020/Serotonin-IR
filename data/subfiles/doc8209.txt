Matthiessen, L., et al. (1993). "Immunocytochemical localization of 5-HT1A receptors in the rat immature cerebellum." Neuroreport 4(6): 763-766.

	The serotonin 5-HT1A receptors were visualized in the cerebellar vermis of 8-day-old and adult rats by immunocytochemistry using anti-5-HT1A receptor antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to a highly selective portion of the receptor amino acid sequence (El Mestikawy et al, Neurosci Lett 118, 189-192, 1990). The 5-HT1A receptor-like immunoreactivity was particularly abundant in the posterior lobules (IXB-X) of the immature vermis where it was found in the molecular-Purkinje cell layers. Immunostaining was confined to the plasmic membrane of the Purkinje cell somas, dendrites and perhaps axons (at their somatic emergence) suggesting that 5-HT receptors might participate in non-junctional 5-HT neurotransmission in the immature cerebellum.
