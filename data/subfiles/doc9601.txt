	Because the "intensity dependence" of cortical auditory evoked potentials (IDAP) is under serotonergic control, it can be used to assess central antimigraine effects of 5HT1B/1D agonists. We measured IDAP before and 2 h after naratriptan (5 mg, n = 19) and zolmitriptan (5 mg, n = 19) in healthy volunteers. IDAP was expressed as the amplitude-stimulus intensity function ("ASF slope"). Naratriptan tended to increase ASF slope (mean difference 0.23 +/- 0.62 microV/10 dB, p = 0.06) while zolmitriptan (0.08 +/- 0.95 microV/10 dB, p = 0.35) did not. We assessed the suitability of IDAP for measuring central antimigraine drug effects using repeatability data (see companion paper). We calculated the trade-off between the size of the expected drug effects (ASF slope difference) and the necessary sample size. Because of poor repeatability 36 to 80 subjects are required to detect ASF slope changes in the 0.25-0.5 microV/10 dB range. These data can be used to design trials using IDAP.
