Sharp, S. I., et al. (2008). "Cortical serotonin 1A receptor levels are associated with depression in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia." Dement Geriatr Cogn Disord 26(4): 330-338.

	BACKGROUND: Serotonin 1A receptors (5-HT(1A)) have not been studied in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) or Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) patients with depression. AIM: To examine 5-HT(1A) in DLB and PDD postmortem in relation to depression. METHODS: [(3)H]8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin binding to 5-HT(1A) was determined in temporal cortex (Brodmann areas, BA20 and BA36) from 10 DLB patients, 17 PDD patients and 9 controls. RESULTS: 5-HT(1A) density was significantly higher in BA36 in combined DLB/PDD patients with depression, but was unaltered in BA20. CONCLUSION: Higher BA36 5-HT(1A) density in PDD and DLB patients than in control is dependent on whether the patient had experienced depression during life, not DLB/PDD diagnosis. A 5-HT(1A) antagonist adjuvant may improve treatment of depression in dementia.
