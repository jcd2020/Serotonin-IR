Carey, R., et al. (2000). "The 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 can block the low-dose locomotor stimulant effects of cocaine." Brain Research 862(1-2): 242-246.

	Cocaine treatments of 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 15.0 mg/kg induced dose-dependent increases in locomotor behavior. This cocaine-induced increase in locomotion was blocked if the animals were administered the selective 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.4 mg/kg) prior to the cocaine treatment. The 0.4-mg/kg dose of WAY 100635 did not affect locomotor behavior or alter cocaine availability in brain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.
