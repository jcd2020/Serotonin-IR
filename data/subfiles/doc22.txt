	A role for serotonin alterations in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has long been suspected because of the psychotogenic effects of serotonergic agonists and the therapeutic effects of 5-HT2 antagonism. This chapter is a review of the evidence derived from pharmacological studies, postmortem, and imaging studies that have assessed the role of serotonin transmission in schizophrenia. While a clear picture of specific serotonergic alterations in schizophrenia has not emerged despite much research, this review reinforces a modulatory role of serotonergic agents on dopamine transmission in schizophrenia, which may contribute to the therapeutic effects of atypical antipsychotics.
