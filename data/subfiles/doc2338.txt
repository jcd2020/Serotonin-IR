Clenet, F., et al. (2005). "Role of GABA-ergic and serotonergic systems in the anxiolytic-like mechanism of action of a 5-HT-moduline antagonist in the mouse elevated plus maze." Behav Brain Res 158(2): 339-348.

	5-HT-moduline is an endogenous tetrapeptide, which acts specifically as an antagonist of 5-HT1B auto- and heteroreceptors. HG1 is an ethyl arylmethyloxypiperidine acetate and an antagonist of 5-HT-moduline, which has no 5-HT-moduline agonist effect. In a pilot study, HG1 has demonstrated an anxiolytic-like profile in three mouse models of anxiety (elevated plus maze, light/dark, four plates). The aim of our study was to examine the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 in the mouse elevated plus maze. Male Swiss mice were acutely administered HG1 at active doses in association with GABA antagonists such as flumazenil, bicuculline and picrotoxine, then, with 5-HT1A (NAN 190, WAY 100635) and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (methiothepine). Finally, we tried to potentiate non-active doses of HG1 with 5-HT1A (8-OHDPAT) and 5-HT1B receptor agonists (anpirtoline) in the mouse elevated plus maze. Regarding GABA antagonists, only flumazenil antagonised active doses of HG1 in an incomplete manner. Moreover, non-active doses of HG1 were potentiated by low doses of WAY 100635 and by anpirtoline but not by 8-OHDPAT. Finally, the anxiolytic-like effects of HG1 at active doses were antagonised by all serotonergic antagonists (WAY 100635 at higher dose, NAN 190 and methiothepin). HG1 mechanism of action in the mouse elevated plus maze seems to associate a GABA-ergic component exerting a limited regulation of 5-HT neuronal activity and a major serotonergic component, which seems to implicate presynaptic 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.
