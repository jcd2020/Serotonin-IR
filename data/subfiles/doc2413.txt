Dawson, L. A. and J. M. Watson (2009). "Vilazodone: A 5-HT1A Receptor Agonist/Serotonin Transporter Inhibitor for the Treatment of Affective Disorders." Cns Neuroscience & Therapeutics 15(2): 107-117.

	Vilazodone (EMD 68843; 5-{4-[4-(5-cyano-3-indolyl)-butyl]-1-piperazinyl}-benzofuran-2-carboxamide hydrochloride) is a combined serotonin specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist currently under clinical evaluation for the treatment of major depression. This molecule was designed based on the premise that negative feedback circuitry, mediated via 5-HT1 receptors, limits the acute SSRI-induced enhancements in serotonergic neurotransmission. If the hypothesis is correct, combination of SSRI with 5-HT1A partial agonism should temporally enhance the neuroplastic adaptation and subsequently hasten therapeutic efficacy compared to current treatments. Preclinical in vitro evaluation has confirmed vilazodone's primary pharmacological profile both in clonal and native systems, that is, serotonin reuptake blockade and 5-HT1A partial agonism. However, in vivo and in contrast to combination of 8-OH-DPAT and paroxetine, vilazodone selectively enhanced serotonergic output in the prefrontal cortex of rats. Behavioral evaluations, in the ultrasonic vocalization model of anxiety in rats, demonstrated anxiolytic efficacy. In the forced swim test (a putative model of depression), vilazodone also showed efficacy but at a single dose only. In man, vilazodone abolished REM sleep and demonstrated clinical antidepressant efficacy equivalent to an SSRI. Ongoing clinical evaluations will hopefully reveal whether the founding hypothesis was valid and if vilazodone will produce a more rapid onset of antidepressant efficacy.
