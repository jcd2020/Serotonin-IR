Corley, K. C., et al. (1992). "Effect of gepirone on increases in tryptophan hydroxylase in response to sound stress." Eur J Pharmacol 213(3): 417-425.

	Pretreatment (15 min) of male rats with gepirone given parenterally (10 mg/kg i.p.) or intracranially into the dorsal raphe nucleus (14 or 21 micrograms) blocks the rapidly reversible increase in brain tryptophan hydroxylase activity and 5-hydroxyindolamine acetic acid tissue levels seen in vitro after 1-h acute sound stress. Chronic gepirone treatment over 28 days (40 mg/day s.c.) prevents the stable enzyme activity increase induced by repeated sessions of sound stress, and the rapidly reversible increase always observed following sound stress. The gepirone metabolite, 1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazine, is inactive in each of these experiments. Transient blood pressure elevations occur with each sound presentation, but no persistent hypertension is observed with repeated sound-stress exposures. Gepirone may block the sound stress-induced biochemical increases by its inhibition of serotonergic neuronal firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus that is mediated by its agonist action at the somatodendritic (5-HT1A) autoreceptors.
