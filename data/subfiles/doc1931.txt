	[F-18]Mefway is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for quantification of the brain serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor density. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiation safety of [F-18]Mefway in humans. Six healthy volunteers (three males and three females) were whole-body PET scanned for 114 min after injection of [F-18]Mefway (226 +/- 35 MBq). Estimated radiation doses were determined by the OLINDA/EXM software. [F-18]Mefway was safe and well tolerated by all subjects. Residence time ranges from 0 (gallbladder) to 0.822 h (urinary bladder wall). While the estimated radiation doses in the reproductive and blood-forming organs were below 13.35-22.87 mu Sv/MBq, radiation dose in the urinary bladder wall was 471 mu Sv/MBq. The mean effective dose was 40.23 +/- 6.63 mu Sv/MBq. For a typical single injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi), the dose will result in 87.1 mSv for the urinary bladder wall. To reduce radiation burden, the bladder voiding can be used before [F-18]Mefway PET scan.
