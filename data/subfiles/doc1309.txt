	It has been claimed that the aversive behaviour induced by electrical stimulation of the midbrain tectum (MT) has validity as an animal model of panic attack. A great deal of evidence obtained from behavioural studies suggests that 5-HT2 mechanisms phasically inhibit the substrates of aversion in the MT. In order to test this hypothesis we employed the technique of microiontophoresis of drugs onto neurons of the MT to assess the identity of the receptors mediating the effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). The results obtained show that the majority of 5-HT responsive cells in MT are cells excited by 5-HT (72%). These cells were silent or showed very low spontaneous firing activity, whereas cells depressed by 5-HT showed high spontaneous firing activity at baseline. The 5-HT1A receptor agonists, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), buspirone and gepirone caused consistent reduction in the firing rate of cells depressed by 5-HT while they did not change the firing activity of cells excited by 5-HT. The excitatory effects induced by 5-HT on MT neurones were clearly attenuated by concomitant application of ketanserin, a highly specific 5-HT2 antagonist. Excitatory responses to DL-homocysteic acid were not affected by ketanserin. Previous administration of zimelidine, a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor, caused a significant enhancement of the excitatory effects of 5-HT while similar application of gepirone did not affect the size of the excitatory responses to 5-HT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
