Bago, M. and C. Dean (2001). "Sympathoinhibition from ventrolateral periaqueductal gray mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors in the RVLM." Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 280(4): R976-984.

	The role of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptors located in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in the mediation of a sympathoinhibitory and depressor response elicited from the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) matter of the midbrain was examined in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized rats. Activation of neurons in the vlPAG evoked a decrease in renal and lumbar sympathetic nerve activities and a decrease in arterial blood pressure. After microinjection of the specific 5-HT(1A)-receptor antagonist WAY-100635 into the pressor area of the RVLM, the vlPAG-evoked sympathoinhibition and hypotension was attenuated to control levels (7 of 15 animals) or converted into a sympathoexcitation and pressor response (8 of 15 animals). Baroreflex inhibition of sympathetic nerve activity was not impaired by microinjection of WAY into the sympathoexcitatory region of the RVLM. These data suggest that sympathoinhibition and hypotension elicited by activation of neurons in the vlPAG are mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors in the RVLM.
