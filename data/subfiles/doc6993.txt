Martin, D. C., et al. (1991). "FENTANYL AND SUFENTANIL INHIBIT AGONIST BINDING TO 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN MEMBRANES FROM THE RAT-BRAIN." Neuropharmacology 30(4): 323-327.

	The influence of several opioid narcotics and related drugs, on the binding of [H-3]8-hydroxy-N,N-dipropyl-2-aminotetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT), a serotonergic agonist, to 5-HT1A receptors was determined in membranes from the brain of the rat. Sufentanil and fentanyl inhibited binding of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT to hippocampal membranes, with IC50 values of 5.5 and 3.4-mu-M, respectively. In contrast, IC50 values for meperidine, alfentanil and naloxone exceeded 100-mu-M. The inhibition of binding by sufentanil appeared to be competitive insofar as 10-mu-M sufentanil increased the apparent K(D) from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.9 +/- 0.3 nM, without affecting the number of binding sites and the inhibition was easily reversed. The binding of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT to hippocampal membranes was inhibited by 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, a stable analogue of GTP, in a concentration-dependent manner. None of the opioid drugs examined altered the sensitivity of binding of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT to guanine nucleotides. These results suggest that certain opioid narcotics, disrupt serotonergic neurotransmission as a result of direct interactions with 5-HT1A receptors. No effects of opioid narcotics on 5-HT1A receptor-G protein coupling were noted.
