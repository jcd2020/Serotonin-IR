	For nearly three decades, evidence supporting a role for aberrant serotonergic function in the pathogenesis of depression has accumulated; however, only recently have methodologies and radiotracers suitable for in vivo clinical assessment of depression become available. To date, only a few neurochemical imaging studies have been performed in actively depressed subjects. A preliminary study using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has demonstrated decreased levels of serotonin (5-HT) transporters in the midbrain regions of subjects with major depression. Analysis of the 5-HT2 receptor using positron emission tomography (PET) has suggested that this receptor may not be altered significantly in the depressed brain but may increase in response to antidepressant treatment. These findings are supported by studies in secondary "poststroke" depression that have shown that elevations in 5-HT2 receptor density correlated with the alleviation of symptoms of depressed mood. With the rapid development of novel PET and SPECT radiotracers, future studies of the serotonergic system that evaluate presynaptic (5-HT transporter) and postsynaptic (5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors) markers and the interaction of synaptic levels of 5-HT with these sites will make profound contributions to the understanding of the role of the serotonergic synapse in the pathophysiology of depression.
