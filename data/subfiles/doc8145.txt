	The effects of female gonadal hormones on 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT)-induced flat body posture, hypothermia, and eating behavior were examined. Ovariectomized rats were injected with estradiol benzoate, estradiol benzoate, and progesterone, progesterone or vehicle on each of 2 consecutive weeks. On each week, the behavioral effects of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, or the combination of both 8-OH-DPAT and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochloride (DOI), a 5-HT2 receptor agonist, were examined. 8-OH-DPAT produced flat body posture, hypothermia, and eating behavior on each week of the experiment. Female gonadal hormones modulated eating behavior (e.g., rats treated with estradiol benzoate showed less eating after 8-OH-DPAT), but had no effect on either fiat body posture or hypothermia. The 5-HT2 receptor agonist, DOI, attenuated 8-OH-DPAT's effect on flat body posture and on hypothermia, but not on eating behavior. 8-OH-DPAT's effect on all behaviors declined during the second week of the experiment.
