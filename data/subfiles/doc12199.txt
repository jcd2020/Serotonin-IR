Stoessl, A. J., et al. (1995). "Pharmacological characterization of grooming induced by a selective NK-1 tachykinin receptor agonist." Brain Res 700(1-2): 115-120.

	Bilateral intranigral administration of the selective NK-1 tachykinin receptor agonist [AcArg6, Sar9, Met(O2)11]SP6-11 (0-1 nmol total bilateral dose) selectively induced grooming in rats. This response was blocked by concurrent intranigral administration of the NK-1 tachykinin receptor antagonist RP 67580 (2 nmol), but not by NK-2 (L-659,877) or NK-3 ([Trp7, beta-Ala8]NKA4-10) antagonists. Pretreatment with systemic opioid (naloxone 1.5 mg/kg) and D1 dopamine (SCH 23390 100 micrograms/kg) receptor antagonists also attenuated tachykinin-induced grooming, which was unaffected by D2 dopamine (sulpiride 30 mg/kg) or 5-HT2A+C (ritanserin 2 mg/kg) antagonists. Grooming induced by intranigral [AcArg6, Sar9, Met(O2)11]SP6-11 was also attenuated by bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the substantia nigra. These findings indicate that grooming induced by intranigral tachykinins reflects activation of NK-1 receptors and is dependent upon endogenous dopamine and consequent selective stimulation of D1 dopamine receptors.
