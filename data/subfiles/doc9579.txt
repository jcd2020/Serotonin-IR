Rombolà, L., et al. (2020). "Role of 5-HT1A Receptor in the Anxiolytic-Relaxant Effects of Bergamot Essential Oil in Rodent." Int J Mol Sci 21(7).

	The essential oil obtained by the fresh fruit of Citrus bergamia Risso et Poiteau is used worldwide in aromatherapy to reduce pain, facilitate sleep induction, and/or minimize the effects of stress-induced anxiety. Preclinical pharmacological data demonstrate that bergamot essential oil (BEO) modulates specific neurotransmissions and shows an anxiolytic-relaxant effect not superimposable to that of the benzodiazepine diazepam, suggesting that neurotransmissions, other than GABAergic, could be involved. Several studies on essential oils indicate a role for serotonergic (5-HT) neurotransmission in anxiety. Interestingly, among serotonergic receptors, the 5-HT1A subtype seems to play a key role in the control of anxiety. Here, we report that modulation of the 5-HT1A receptor by selective agonist ((±)8-OH-DPAT) or antagonist (WAY-100635) may influence some of the anxiolytic-relaxant effects of BEO in Open Field and Elevated Plus Maze tests.
