Todd, R. D. (1992). "NEURAL DEVELOPMENT IS REGULATED BY CLASSICAL NEUROTRANSMITTERS - DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR STIMULATION ENHANCES NEURITE OUTGROWTH." Biological Psychiatry 31(8): 794-807.

	The classical neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine are thought to be involved in the etiology or treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent studies suggest that these neurotransmitters may also have roles as neural morphogens during brain development. Previously, we have demonstrated that stimulation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors selectively inhibited neurite branching in an in vitro system (Sikich et al 1990). In the present study, the developmental role of dopamine D2 receptors in the control of neurite outgrowth has been investigated by quantitating the morphological response of cortical neurons to agonist stimulation in vitro. Cultures of fetal rat frontal, cortical neurons were shown to express both alternatively spliced forms of D2 receptor messenger RNA (mRNA). The larger mRNA form predominated (D2A444:D2A415 ratio of about 6:1). In a small but significant percentage of these neurons, culture in the presence of the D2 receptor selective agonist, quinpirole, resulted in a three-to ten-fold increase in the length of neurites and in the number of branch points per neurite. These effects were blocked by the D2 receptor antagonists eticlopride and spiperone. Early abnormalities in the stimulation of dopamine or serotonin receptor subtypes could lead to the types of neuroanatomical changes observed in studies of schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, and autism. These morphogenic effects of classical transmitters could unite neurodevelopmental and neurotransmitter theories of the etiology of severe psychiatric disorders.
