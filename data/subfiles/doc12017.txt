Yamada, K., et al. (2002). "Decreased marble burying behavior in female mice lacking neuromedin-B receptor (NMB-R) implies the involvement of NMB/NMB-R in 5-HT neuron function." Brain Research 942(1-2): 71-78.

	Neuromedin B (NMB) is a mammalian bombesin-like peptide distributed widely in the central nervous system. This peptide exerts its function via the NMB receptor (NMB-R). Female NMB-R-deficient mice were used to study the role that NMB/NMB-R may play in 5-HT neuron function since this relationship was suggested in previous in vitro studies. As 5-HT neurons are thought to modulate marble burying behavior, a role for NMB-R in this behavior was assessed. Relative to wild-type mice, NMB-R-deficient mice showed decreased marble burying behavior. However, depletion of 5-HT by treatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA) increased burying behavior in NMB-R-deacient mice suggesting that increased levels of 5-HT in the brain cause a decrease in burying behavior in NMB-R-deficient mice. While HPLC analysis showed that 5-HT content in the whole brain does not differ between NMB-R-deficient and wild-type mice, an immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections showed that 5-HT expression in the dorsal raphe (DR) nucleus is elevated in NMB-R-deficient mice. Furthermore, a quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that 5-HT1A-receptor gene expression is downregulated in NMB-R-deficient mice at the whole brain level. These behavioral and biological results suggest that NMB/NMB-R may modulate 5-HT neuronal activity by affecting DR function. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science BY All rights reserved.
