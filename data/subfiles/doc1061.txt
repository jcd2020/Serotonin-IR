Bhatt, S., et al. (2013). "Anti-depressant like activity of N-n-butyl-3-methoxyquinoxaline-2-carboxamide (6o) a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist." Indian J Exp Biol 51(6): 435-443.

	The compound 6o (at 0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg, ip) with optimum log P and pA2 value, was subjected to forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The compound 6o significantly reduced the duration of immobility in mice without affecting the base line locomotion in actophotometer. Moreover, 6o (2 mg/kg, ip), potentiated the 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced head twitch responses in mice and at 1 and 2 mg/kg, ip antagonized the reserpine-induced hypothermia (RIH) in rats. In interaction studies with various standard drugs/ligands using FST, 6o (1 and 2 mg/kg, ip) potentiated the anti-depressant effect fluoxetine (5 mg/kg, ip) and reversed the depressant effect of parthenolide (1 mg/kg, ip) by reducing the duration of immobility. Furthermore, 6o (1 and 2 mg/kg, ip) potentiated the effect of bupropion (10 mg/kg, ip) in TST. The behavioural anomalies of the olfactory bulbectomised (OBX) rats were augmented by chronic 6o (1 and 2 mg/kg) treatment as observed from the modified open field test (parameters: ambulation, rearing, fecal pellet). The results suggest that compound 6o exhibited anti-depressant like effect in rodent models of depression.
