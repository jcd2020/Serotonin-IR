Munn, R. G. and N. McNaughton (2008). "Effects of fluoxetine on hippocampal rhythmic slow activity and behavioural inhibition." Behav Pharmacol 19(3): 257-264.

	Anxiolytics that act as GABAA agonists and those that act as 5-HT1A receptor agonists all reduce the frequency of hippocampal rhythmic slow activity (RSA). Changes in RSA have been linked to changes in behavioural inhibition and therefore anxiety - but this has not been tested with specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors, which are antidepressant and anxiolytic; therefore we tested the effects of fluoxetine on RSA and behavioural inhibition. Fluoxetine (FLU; 10 and 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) produced a dose-related reduction in the frequency of reticular-elicited RSA. Groups of rats received, intraperitoneally, either (i) saline, or 5 mg/kg fluoxetine, or 10 mg/kg fluoxetine; or (ii) saline, or 20 mg/kg fluoxetine, or 6.6 mg/kg of the 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (BUS) and were tested on a fixed interval 60-s schedule and a differential reinforcement of low rates 15-s schedule. FLU at 5 mg/kg produced effects similar to low doses of BUS and other anxiolytics. FLU (10 and 20 mg/kg) produced effects more like those reported earlier for higher doses of BUS. These results continue to link anxiolysis, RSA and behavioural inhibition, and suggest that serotonergic anxiolytics share some of the central actions of GABAergic anxiolytics, but at higher doses, administered acutely, have distinct side effects that can obscure their anxiolytic action in behavioural tasks.
