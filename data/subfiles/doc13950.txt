Zajdel, P., et al. (2018). "Novel multi-target azinesulfonamides of cyclic amine derivatives as potential antipsychotics with pro-social and pro-cognitive effects." Eur J Med Chem 145: 790-804.

	Currently used antipsychotics are characterized by multireceptor mode of action. While antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors is responsible for the alleviation of "positive" symptoms of schizophrenia and the effects at other, particularly serotonergic receptors are necessary for their additional therapeutic effects, there is no consensus regarding an "ideal" target engagement. Here, a detailed SAR analysis in a series of 45 novel azinesulfonamides of cyclic amine derivatives, involving the aryl-piperazine/piperidine pharmacophore, central alicyclic amine and azinesulfonamide groups has led to the selection of (S)-4-((2-(2-(4-(benzo[b]thiophen-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)sulfo nyl)isoquinoline (62). The polypharmacology profile of 62, characterized by partial 5-HT1AR agonism, 5-HT2A/5-HT7/D2/D3R antagonism, and blockade of SERT, reduced the "positive"-like, and "negative"-like symptoms of psychoses. Compound 62 produced no catalepsy, demonstrated a low hyperprolactinemia liability and displayed pro-cognitive effects in the novel object recognition task and attentional set-shifting test. While association of in vitro features with the promising in vivo profile of 62 is still not fully established, its clinical efficacy should be verified in further stages of development.
