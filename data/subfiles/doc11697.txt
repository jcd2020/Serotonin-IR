Shi, J., et al. (2007). "Agonist induced-phosphorylation of Galpha11 protein reduces coupling to 5-HT2A receptors." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 323(1): 248-256.

	We previously demonstrated that 24-h treatment with (-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl (DOI) causes phosphorylation of Galpha11 protein at serine 154 and that this phosphorylation causes desensitization of serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor signaling in A1A1v cells (Shi et al., 2007). We now report that treatment of A1A1v cells with DOI for 24 h produces a greater reduction in the Bmax of [125I](+/-)-DOI-labeled high-affinity binding sites (46%) than the reduction of [3H]ketanserin binding sites (25%). Although the KD values are not altered, there is a smaller amount of GTPgammaS [guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate]-sensitive [125I](+/-)-DOI binding in DOI-treated cells. These results suggest that DOI treatment causes down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors and reductions in G protein-coupled 5-HT2A receptors. In contrast, in cells transfected with the phosphorylation state mimic G(alpha11)S154D, GTPgammaS-sensitive [125I](+/-)-DOI binding was decreased by 48%; however, there was no significant difference in the KD and Bmax values of [125I](+/-)-DOI-labeled receptors. The receptor binding experiments suggest that phosphorylation of Galpha11 on serine 154 reduces coupling of 5-HT2A receptors, whereas DOI causes down-regulation of 5-HT2A receptors in addition to the phosphorylation-induced uncoupling of Galpha11 to 5-HT2A receptors. To determine whether DOI increases phosphorylation of Galphaq/11 protein in vivo, rats were treated with 1 mg/kg/day DOI or saline for 1 to 7 days. Seven days of DOI treatment significantly decreased phospholipase C activity stimulated by an Emax concentration of 5-HT by 40% and increased phosphorylation of Galphaq/11 proteins by 51% in the frontal cortex. These data suggest that DOI causes phosphorylation of Galphaq/11 in vivo and could thereby contribute to the desensitization of 5-HT2A receptors.
