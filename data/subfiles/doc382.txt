	AIM: Curcumin, derived from turmeric, has been demonstrated to be effective in controlling seizures, although the exact mechanism is yet unknown. In this study, the role of serotonin and its receptors in the anticonvulsant effect of curcumin was evaluated in mice. MAIN METHODS: Total 110 mice were randomly divided into 11 groups (n=10). In the first to the fourth groups, the role of curcumin (150mg/kg, i.p) and serotonin (PCPA (100mg/kg); was used to deplete the brain serotonin levels) was investigated. The fifth group first received NAD-299 (4mg/kg, sc), RS-102221 (5mg/kg, i.p), SDZ205-557 Hydrochloride (1mg/kg, i.p), and SB 26997 (10mg/kg, i.p), then curcumin. The sixth group received NAD-299, curcumin. The animals in the seventh to ninth groups received 5-HT2C, 5-HT4, and 5-HT7 antagonists, respectively, with curcumin. The tenth group received HTR2C antagonist and the eleventh group received HTR4 antagonist. In all animals 25min after curcumin PTZ (80mg/kg; i.p) was injected. KEY FINDINGS: PCPA not only inhibited the anticonvulsant action of curcumin, but also reversed some of its anticonvulsant effect. The 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT4 antagonists diminished but 5-HT7 antagonist strengthened the anticonvulsant effect of curcumin. Evaluation of gene expression using real-time PCR confirmed that only 5-HT7 gene expression was reduced after curcumin injection. SIGNIFICANCE: According to these results, it may be suggested that curcumin exerts anticonvulsive effects by increasing the serotonin levels in the brain that influence receptors, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT4 and likely through the reduction of 5-HT7 gene expression.
