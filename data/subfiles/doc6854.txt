Kruger, H., et al. (1999). "Effects of ionotropic glutamate receptor blockade and 5-HT1A receptor activation on spreading depression in rat neocortical slices." Neuroreport 10(12): 2651-2656.

	The effect of the AMPA antagonist NBQX (10 microM), NMDA antagonist ketamine (100 microM) and 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (1, 10 and 100 microM) on the properties of a KCl-induced spreading depression (SD) was studied in parietal cortical slices of adult rats. Whereas NBQX did not significantly affect the SD, ketamine significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the amplitude of the first SD peak (12.8 +/- 4.6 mV) and blocked the second SD peak when compared with the controls (19.8 +/- 5.2 mV and 25 +/- 5 mV, respectively). Ketamine also decreased the SD duration at half maximal amplitude from 34.9 +/- 12.4 s to 22.2 +/- 12 s (p < 0.05). 8-OH-DPAT attenuated the duration of the SD from 42 +/- 15.6 s to 21.2 +/- 10.6 s (p < 0.05, 100 microM). These data indicate that not only NMDA receptor blockade, but also activation of the 5-HT1A receptor attenuates the SD and may be beneficial in the reduction of ischemic injury following focal cerebral ischemia.
