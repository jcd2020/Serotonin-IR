	The involvement of the hippocampus in pain has been demonstrated but key players, i.e. the major brain receptors have not been shown to be modulated by pain. It was therefore the aim of the study to show the concerted action and pattern of brain receptor complex levels in a non-invasive model of moderate pain. C57BL/6J mice were divided into four groups of 14 animals each: trained injected, trained non-injected, yoked injected and yoked non-injected. Animals were tested in the open field and the elevated plus maze for behavioural evaluation and cognitive functions were tested using the Morris Water Maze. Hippocampi were taken 6 h following sacrification. Membrane proteins were prepared by ultracentrifugation and run on blue native gels to keep the native state, blotted to membranes and western blotting was carried out using the primary antibodies against serotonin receptor 5HT1A, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M1 (mAChR-M1), nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha7 (nAChR-alpha7), glutamate (AMPA) receptor (GluR1) and neurokinin receptor 1 (NK-1). There was no difference between performance in behaviour or in the MWM between groups. Brain receptor level changes involved all receptors given above. Pain affected mAChR-M1, GluR1 and NK-1 complex levels when yoked-injected were compared with yoked non-injected animals. Memory mechanisms affected mAChR-M1 complex levels when trained non-injected animals were compared with yoked non-injected controls. Taken together, the neurochemical basis for testing receptor agonists/antagonists on the role of pain and the hippocampus was generated that may be useful for interpretations of the role of this complex area in moderate pain.
