	1 5-HT moduline (5-HTm) is tetrapeptide (Leu-Ser-Ala-Leu) previously shown to act as a specific endogenous antagonist to central 5-HT1B/1D receptors. Its effects were investigated in rat and rabbit pulmonary arteries (PAs). 2 In rabbit PAs, contractile responses to the 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) were inhibited by 1 and 10 muM 5-HTm in a non-competitive fashion with the maximum contractile response (E-max, per cent of response to 50 mm KC1) being reduced from 65.6 +/- 7% (n = 6) to 39.7 +/- 6.5% (n = 6) and 25.2 +/- 7.9 (n = 4), respectively. The ability of 5-HTm to inhibit responses to 5-CT was increased by the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin (10 muM). 3 In the rabbit PAs, the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N-omega-nitro-L-arginine methylester (L-NAME) potentiated responses to 5-CT (E-max: 106 +/- 22.5 (n = 4)) and this response was also inhibited by 10 muM 5-HTm (E-max: 38 +/- 13% (n = 8)). 4 5-HTm (10 muM) inhibited responses to 5-CT in rat PAs, the E,,a being reduced from 24.8 +/- 4.1% (n = 7) to 15.5 +/- 3.7% (n = 9). 5-HTm induced relaxation of 5-CT-pre-constricted rat PAs with a pIC(50) Of 9.0 +/- 0.6 (n = 9). 5 In PAs from chronic hypoxic, pulmonary hypertensive rats, the maximum response to 5-CT was increased to 80 +/- 8.5% (n = 11). 5-HTm reduced this response to 34.4 +/- 6.3% (n = 12). L-NAME markedly inhibited the ability of 5-HTm to inhibit responses to 5-CT (Em before 5-HTm: 100.5 +/- 16% (n = 5), Emax after 5-HTm: 107 +/- 11.3% (n = 4)). 6 In conclusion we show here for the first time that 5-HTm is a non-competitive inhibitor of 5-HT1B/1D receptor-mediated constriction in PAs. In rat PAs, L-NAME can inhibit this effect of 5-HTm.
