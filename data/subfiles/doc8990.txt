Moskowitz, M. A. (1992). "NEUROGENIC VERSUS VASCULAR MECHANISMS OF SUMATRIPTAN AND ERGOT ALKALOIDS IN MIGRAINE." Trends Pharmacol Sci 13(8): 307-311.

	Sumatriptan and the ergot alkaloids are useful tools for deciphering drug mechanisms in migraine and related headaches. Both neuronal and vascular mechanisms have been proposed on the basis of actions of 5-HT at receptors resembling the 5-HT1D subtype. In this Viewpoint article, Michael A. Moskowitz argues that blockade of neural transmission and the neurogenic inflammatory response provides a mechanism by which sumatriptan and ergot alkaloids alleviate vascular headaches. He postulates, with similar arguments, that sumatriptan and ergot alkaloids may block headaches that develop from meningovascular inflammatory disorders such as from viral and bacterial meningitis and from the sequelae of head injury.
