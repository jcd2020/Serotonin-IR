Paudice, P. and M. Raiteri (1991). "Cholecystokinin release mediated by 5-HT3 receptors in rat cerebral cortex and nucleus accumbens." Br J Pharmacol 103(3): 1790-1794.

	1. The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the release of cholexystokinin-like immunoreactivity (CCK-LI) were examined in synaptosomes prepared from rat cerebral cortex and nucleus accumbens and depolarized by superfusion with 15 mM KCl. 2. In both areas 5-HT, tested between 0.1 and 100 nM, increased the calcium-dependent, depolarization-evoked CCK-LI release in a concentration-related manner. The concentration-response curves did not differ significantly between the two brain areas (EC50: 0.4 +/- 0.045 nM and 0.48 +/- 0.053 nM, respectively, in cortical and n. accumbens synaptosomes; maximal effect: about 60% at 10 nM 5-HT). 3. The 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist methiothepin (300 nM) did not affect the CCK-LI release elicited by 10 nM 5-HT. However, the effects of 10 nM 5-HT were antagonized in a concentration-dependent manner by the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (3 alpha-tropanyl)-1H-indole-3-carboxylic acid ester (ICS 205-930; 0.1-100 nM; IC50: 3.56 +/- 0.42 nM in the cortex and 3.90 +/- 0.50 nM in the n. accumbens) and ondasetron (IC50: 8.15 +/- 0.73 nM in the cerebral cortex). 5-HT (10 nM) was also strongly antagonized by 100 nM 1 alpha H, 3 alpha 5 alpha H-tropan-3-yl-3,5-dichlorobenzoate (MDL 72222) another blocker of the 5-HT3 receptor. Moreover, the 5-HT3 receptor agonist 1-phenylbiguanide (tested in the cerebral cortex between 0.1 and 100 nM) enhanced CCK-LI release in a manner almost identical to that of 5-HT (EC50 = 0.64 +/- 0.071 nM). 4. It is concluded that 5-HT can act as a potent releaser of CCK-LI in rat cerebrocortex and nucleus accumbens through the activation of receptors of the 5-HT3 type situated on the CCK-releasing terminals. This interaction may provide a rationale for the clinical development of both 5-HT3 and CCK receptor antagonists as novel anxiolytic drugs.
