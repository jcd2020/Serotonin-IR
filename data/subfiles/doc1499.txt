	Background and purpose: A strategy to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD) is to increase the soluble form of amyloid precursor protein (sAPP alpha), a promnesic protein, in the brain. Because strong evidence supports beneficial effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT4 receptor agonists in memory and learning, we investigated the role of 5-HT4 receptors on APP processing in 8 weeks-old male C57BL/6j mice. Experimental approach: Mice were given, subcutaneously, prucalopride or ML 10302 (s.c.), two highly selective 5-HT4 receptor agonists and, up to 240 min later, the hippocampus and cortex were analysed by Western blot for sAPPa determination. Key results: Prucalopride (5 or 10 mg kg(-1)) significantly increased sAPP alpha levels in the hippocampus and cortex, but did not modify the expression level of APP mRNA as detected by quantitative RT-PCR. A selective 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, GR125487 (1 mg kg(-1), s.c.) inhibited prucalopride induced-increase in sAPP alpha levels. In addition, levels of sAPP alpha were increased by ML10302 only at 20 mg kg(-1) and was limited to the cortex. Also, prucalopride increased sAPP alpha levels in the cortex of a transgenic mouse model of AD, expressing the London mutation of APP. Furthermore, the combined injection of a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil and prucalopride induced a synergic increase in sAPP alpha levels in the cortex and hippocampus. Conclusions and implications: Our results demonstrate that the 5-HT4 receptor plays a key role in the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism in vivo and give support to the beneficial use of 5-HT4 agonists for AD treatment.
