Anzini, M., et al. (1989). "Synthesis and 5HT-receptors affinity of some 4-phenylquinoline derivatives." Farmaco 44(6): 555-563.

	The synthesis of a series of 4-phenylquinolines with substituents in 2,3 and 6-position of the quinoline nucleus is described. Serotoninergic activity towards 5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT2, 5HT1A + B receptors and the 5-HT-uptake site was also studied.
