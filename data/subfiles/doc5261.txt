	BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant drugs have a delayed onset and commonly produce an incomplete therapeutic response. The therapeutic actions of SSRIs are thought to depend on increased forebrain extracellular serotonin (5-HT), after desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. Here we determined whether concurrent glucocorticoid receptor (GR) blockade enhances these neurochemical responses to the SSRI fluoxetine. METHODS: Male rats were treated (3, 7, or 14 days) with either fluoxetine (10 mg/kg IP) or vehicle once daily, in combination with either a GR antagonist (Org 34850 15 mg/kg SC or Org 34517 25 mg/kg SC) or vehicle twice daily. After treatment, 5-HT in the medial prefrontal cortex was measured by microdialysis. RESULTS: Chronic fluoxetine treatment (14 days) raised basal 5-HT and also attenuated the fall in 5-HT after acute systemic administration of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg IP), indicating desensitization of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. Concurrent chronic administration (14 days) of Org 34850 or Org 34517 enhanced the fluoxetine-induced increase in basal 5-HT. Org 34850 also hastened the 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor desensitization induced by chronic fluoxetine treatment. Org 34850 alone (14 days) failed to alter basal 5-HT or 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor desensitization. CONCLUSIONS: Antidepressant response is proposed to depend on 5-HT(1A) autoreceptor desensitization and elevation of forebrain 5-HT. These data suggest adjunctive GR antagonists might both hasten and enhance antidepressant responses to SSRIs.
