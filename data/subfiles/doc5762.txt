Koenig, J., et al. (2008). "Activation of septal 5-HT1A receptors alters spatial memory encoding, interferes with consolidation, but does not affect retrieval in rats subjected to a water-maze task." Hippocampus 18(1): 99-118.

	Using Long-Evans rats tested in a water maze, this study assessed the role of 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptors of the medial septum in encoding, consolidation, and retrieval of spatial information. The testing protocol (acquisition: daily four-trial sessions over three consecutive days; retention: probe trial on day 4) was first validated by showing that intraseptal infusions of lidocaine (LIDO; 40 mu g/0.5 mu L) disrupted acquisition and retrieval of the task. 8-OH-DPAT (4 mu g/0.5 mu L) infused before each acquisition session prevented learning/retention of the platform location, an effect attenuated by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635. With the 5-HT7 antagonist SB 269970, the B-OH-DPAT-induced acquisition deficit seemed attenuated, but there was no subsequent retention. When infused immediately, 1, 4, or 6 h after each acquisition session, 8-OH-DPAT did not hinder consolidation. When the infusions were performed 2 h postacquisition, however, consolidation was disrupted. Finally, when infused before a probe trial after drug-free acquisition, 8-OH-DPAT had no effect, suggesting no interference with retrieval processes. We also established that 8-OH-DPAT had no effects when the platform was visible, and altered neither home-cage activity nor anxiety-related behavior (elevated plus-maze). Altogether, these results show that 5-HT1A receptors in the septal region contribute both to declarative-like information encoding and subsequently, within a given postacquisition time window, to its consolidation. They do not participate in the retrieval of recently learned declarative-like information. These observations suggest that 5-HT1A receptors of the medial septum contribute to a serotonin-mediated mechanism involved in the encoding and consolidation, not the retrieval of spatial hippocampal-dependent knowledge. These results might have some relevance to approaches aimed at modifying serotonergic functions in the brain for the treatment of disorders such as depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and amnesia.
