	In this study, we evaluated, for the first time, the 5-HT (serotonin)-mediated control of glucose homeostasis in the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Intraperitoneal administration of 5-HT increased plasma levels of glucose, adrenaline and noradrenaline. By contrast, intracerebroventricular administration of 5-HT did not cause any significant variation in plasma levels of glucose. The release of endogenous 5-HT following intraperitoneal administration of d-fenfluramine led to a significant increase in plasma levels of glucose and adrenaline. Intraperitoneal administration of (1) MIAN (a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist) did not block either the hyperglycaemic action or the increase in plasma levels of adrenaline induced by 5-HT, but did block the increase in plasma levels of noradrenaline, and (2) 5-CT (a 5-HT1 agonist) increased the plasma levels of glucose and of adrenaline, without altering those of noradrenaline. Administration of TFMPP (a 5-HT1B agonist) did not increase the plasma levels of glucose, and the hyperglycaemic action of 5-HT was not blocked by antagonists of 5-HT1A (WAY 100635), 5-HT1D (BRL 15572), 5-HT2B (SB 204741) or 5-HT7 (pimozide) receptors. It was demonstrated that, in rainbow trout, peripheral 5-HT, but not brain 5-HT intervenes in the modulation of glucose homeostasis with a hyperglycaemic effect. This effect is associated with the release of adrenaline and activation of 5-HT1-like receptors. As far as could be determined in the present study, these 5-HT1-like receptors are unrelated to either the 5HT1A, 5-HT1B or 5-HT1D receptor subtypes of mammals. The 5-HT2-type receptors may mediate the release of noradrenaline, but not of adrenaline, and furthermore, do not appear to play an important role in the hyperglycaemic effect exerted by 5-HT.
