Aloyo, V. J. and J. A. Harvey (2000). "Antagonist binding at 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the rabbit: high correlation with the profile for the human receptors." Eur J Pharmacol 406(2): 163-169.

	This study examined the binding of serotonin receptor antagonists at the 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors of the rabbit's cerebral cortex. The 5-HT(2A) receptor was characterized by the binding of [3H]MDL 100,907 (R(+)-alpha-(2, 3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine-methan ol) to cortical membranes and the 5-HT(2C) receptor by the binding of [3H]mesulergine in the presence of the selective 5-HT(2A) receptor ligand spiperone. Both [3H]MDL 100,907 and [3H]mesulergine demonstrated high affinity binding to single sites in rabbit membranes. Based on Scatchard plots of [3H]MDL 100,907 binding, the mean B(max) was 8.5+/-0.7 fmol/mg tissue and the mean K(d) was 33. 1+/-3.5 pM. For [3H]mesulergine binding the mean B(max) was 3.70+/-0. 58 fmol/mg tissue and the mean K(d) was 0.35+/-0.05 nM. Binding of [3H]MDL 100,907 to the 5-HT(2A) receptor and of [3H]mesulergine to the 5-HT(2C) receptor was confirmed by displacement studies with highly selective 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor ligands. The pharmacological profile of these ligands in rabbits correlated highly with published values for 5-HT(2A) (r=0.91, P<0.001) and 5-HT(2C) (r=0.94, P<0.001) receptors in humans. There was also a high correlation between the profiles for human and rat 5-HT(2C) receptor (r=0.92, P<0.001), but not for 5-HT(2A) receptors (r=0.53, P>0.10). It was concluded that the rabbit provides an appropriate animal model for studies attempting to predict the pharmacology of human 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors.
