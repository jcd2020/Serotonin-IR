De Almeida, R. M., et al. (1998). "8-OH-DPAT in the median raphe nucleus decreases while in the medial septal area it may increase anxiety in female rats." Neurosci Biobehav Rev 23(2): 259-264.

	The experiment evaluated the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on the activity of virgin female rats (diestrus) in the elevated plus maze. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist was infused into the median raphe nucleus (N = 60) and medial septal area (N = 68) 10 min before the test. Five groups for each brain area were analyzed: intact, saline (0.2 microl) and 8-OH-DPAT (0.2; 0.5 and 2.0 microg rat(-1)). The following measures were recorded: number of entries onto open and enclosed arms and time spent on the open and enclosed arms. In addition, the frequency of stretch-attend and head-dipping were also evaluated. The results showed that in the median raphe nucleus only the highest dose of 8-OH-DPAT (2.0 microg) increased the percentage of time spent on the open arms. On the other hand, in medial septal area 8-OH-DPAT in the dose of 0.5 microg decreased the percentage of time spent on the open arms, while the doses of 0.2 and 2.0 microg had no significant impact on anxiety. Data suggest that 8-OH-DPAT acting on 5-HT1A somatodendritic autoreceptors decreases anxiety. However, at a specific dosage and acting on postsynaptic receptors of the medial septal area, 8-OH-DPAT can increase anxiety.
