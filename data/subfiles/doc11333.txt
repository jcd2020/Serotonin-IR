	The allosteric regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a well-known phenomenon, but there are only a few examples of allosteric modulation within the metabotropic serotonergic receptor family. Recently, we described zinc non-competitive interactions toward agonist binding at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, in which biphasic effects, involving potentiation at sub-micromolar concentrations (10 mu M) and inhibition at sub-millimolar concentrations (500 mu M) of Zn2+ in radioligand binding assays, were consistent with both the agonist and antagonist-like effects of zinc ions observed in in vivo studies. Here, we showed new data demonstrating zinc allosteric inhibition of both agonist and antagonist binding at human recombinant 5-HT7 receptors stably expressed in HEK293 cells as observed by radioligand binding studies as well as zinc neutral antagonism displayed by the concentration of 10 mu M in the functional LANCE assay. The allosteric nature of the effect of Zn on 5-HT7 receptors was confirmed (1) in saturation studies in which zinc inhibited the binding of potent orthosteric 5-HT7 receptor radioligands, the agonist [H-3]5-CT, and the two antagonists [3H] SB-269970 and [3H] mesulergine, showing ceiling effect and differences in the magnitude of negative cooperativity (alpha = 0.15, 0.06, and 0.25, respectively); (2) in competition experiments in which 500 mu M of zinc inhibited all radioligand displacements by non-labeled orthosteric ligands (5-CT, SB-269970, and clozapine), and the most significant reduction in affinity was observed for the 5-CT agonist (4.9-16.7-fold) compared with both antagonists (1.4-3.9-fold); and (3) in kinetic experiments in which 500 mu M zinc increased the dissociation rate constants for [3H] 5-CTand [3H] mesulergine but not for [3H] SB-269970. Additionally, in the functional LANCE test using the constitutively active HEK293 cell line expressing the 5-HT7 receptor, 10 mu M zinc had features of neutral antagonism and increased the EC50 value of the 5-CT agonist by a factor of 3.2. Overall, these results showed that zinc can act as a negative allosteric inhibitor of 5-HT7 receptors. Given that the inhibiting effects of low concentrations of zinc in the functional assay represent the most likely direction of zinc activity under physiological conditions, among numerous zinc-regulated proteins, the 5-HT7 receptor can be considered a serotonergic target for zinc modulation in the CNS.
