Cervo, L. and R. Samanin (1995). "Presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors mediate the effect of ipsapirone on punished responding in rats." Eur J Pharmacol 284(3): 249-255.

	The effect of ipsapirone, a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, and of diazepam on punished operant responding was studied in rats injected intracerebroventricularly with 150 microg 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine to deplete brain serotonin or pretreated with (S)-WAY 100135 (N-tert-butyl) 3-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-2-phenylpropanamide dihydrochloride), an antagonist at 5-HT1A receptors. 5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine markedly depleted brain serotonin and caused a sustained increase in punished responding with no effect on rates of unpunished responding in sham-operated rats but had no effect in animals which had received 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine. At 5 and 10 mg/kg ipsapirone reduced unpunished responding similarly in sham-operated and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-treated rats. Diazepam 2.5 mg/kg i.p.significantly increased punished responding and reduced rates of unpunished responding similarly in sham-operated and in 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-treated animals. At 3 and 10 mg/kg (S)-WAY 100135 did not modify punished or unpunished responding but at 10 mg/kg it completely antagonized the effect of 5 mg/kg/s.c. ipsapirone on unpunished and punished responding. The results suggest that ipsapirone releases behaviour that is suppressed by punishment by stimulating presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors.
