	In the present study we examined the distribution pattern of serotonin(2A) (5-HT2A) receptors in the rat cerebellum. A strong immunoreaction against 5-HT2A receptor protein was observed in Purkinje cells. A dense cluster of immunopositive dendritic profiles of Purkinje cells was located beneath the pia matter of cerebellar cortex. Somal profiles in the cerebellar nuclei had weak to moderate immunoreactions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.
