Newman, M. E., et al. (1992). "Regulation of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor function in rat hippocampus by short- and long-term administration of 5-hydroxytryptamine1A agonist and antidepressants." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 260(1): 16-20.

	Single s.c. injections of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1A receptor agonists buspirone at 4 mg/kg, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin at 1 or 4 mg/kg or ipsapirone at 10 mg/kg did not affect 5-HT inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal membranes. However, a single injection of buspirone at 8 mg/kg, and daily injections of each of the agonists for 8 days, resulted in a reduction in the degree of enzyme inhibition by 5-HT. Chronic administration of the antidepressants fluoxetine, zimelidine and maprotiline by i.p. injections at 15 mg/kg for 3 weeks also resulted in a decreased degree of enzyme inhibition. Chronic iprindole at the same dose had no effect. It is concluded that the antidepressant-like properties of 5-HT1A receptor agonists may be mediated partly by a postsynaptic action at the level of serotonergic second messenger transduction in the hippocampus.
