Montgomery, A. M., et al. (1991). "5-HT1A agonists and dopamine: the effects of 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone on brain-stimulation reward." J Neural Transm Gen Sect 83(1-2): 139-148.

	Two specific 5-HT1A agonists, 8-OH-DPAT (0-300 micrograms/kg), and buspirone (0-3.0 mg/kg), were tested on variable-interval, threshold-current self-stimulation of rat lateral hypothalamus. Buspirone produced a prolonged monotonic depression of responding, whereas the effects of 8-OH-DPAT were biphasic: 3.0 micrograms/kg produced a sustained enhancement of responding while higher doses (100-300 micrograms/kg) produced a relatively short-lasting depression. This biphasic pattern parallels previously reported effects of 8-OH-DPAT on food intake and on various other behaviours. Threshold-current self-stimulation is highly sensitive to alterations in dopaminergic transmission but relatively insensitive to changes in 5-HT. Thus the facilitatory effect of low-dose 8-OH-DPAT seems most plausibly interpreted in terms of enhanced dopaminergic transmission. This could be brought about by 5HT1A autoreceptor-mediated inhibiton of 5-HT release and consequent disinhibition of dopaminergic transmission. Depression of self-stimulation by higher doses of 8-OH-DPAT may reflect the activity of 8-OH-DPAT at postsynaptic 5-HT receptors, with consequent inhibition of DA transmission. Suppression of responding after buspirone at all doses tested may reflect the action of this compound as a partial agonist at postsynaptic 5-HT receptors, and/or its effects on other systems.
