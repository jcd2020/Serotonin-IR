	The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of acute third ventricle injections of two different 5-HT4 receptor antagonists, GR 113808 and SB 204070, on water intake in different situations. Injections of 80 nmol/rat of both GR 113808 and SB 204070 were unable to modify water intake in normohydrated rats. Pretreatment with GR 113808 (40 and 80 nmol/rat) and SB 204070 (80 and 160 nmol/rat) blunted water intake after third ventricle injections of angiotensin II (9.6 pmol/rat) compared to saline-pretreated controls. Pretreatment with 80 nmol/rat of both antagonists potentiated drinking induced by third ventricle injections of carbachol (11.0 nmol/rat) compared to saline-pretreated control. In all doses employed, none of the compounds was able to modify water intake in dehydrated rats. A separate control test using one-bottle taste aversion paradigm indicated that the reduction in water intake observed in some of the present experiments could not be attributed to a drug induced malaise. It is suggested that central 5-HT4 receptors exert a dualistic role on the control of water intake potentiating angiotensin II-induced drinking and inhibiting thirst induced by central cholinergic activation (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.
