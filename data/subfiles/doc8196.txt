	Effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on inhibitory synaptic transmission in the rat dorsolateral septal nucleus (DLSN) were examined by conventional intracellular and voltage-clamp recording methods. 5-HT (1-30 microM) depressed the monosynaptic fast IPSC evoked by local stimulation of the DLSN in the presence of DNQX, AP5 and CGP 55845A. CP 93129, a selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist, depressed the fast IPSC. The 5-HT-induced depression of the fast IPSC was attenuated by SB 216641, a selective antagonist for 5-HT1B receptors. 5-HT did not change the inward currents mediated by GABAA receptors, suggesting that 5-HT presynaptically inhibited the fast IPSC. 5-HT and CP 93129 depressed the frequency of miniature fast IPSPs (mIPSPs) without changing their amplitudes. Neither a selective protein kinase A inhibitor, H-89, nor a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, calphostin C, blocked the 5-HT-induced depression of the fast IPSC. N-Ethylmaleimide (NEM) blocked the 5-HT-induced depression of the evoked IPSC. These results suggest that activation of presynaptic 5-HT1B receptors depresses the release of GABA via a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G-protein in the rat DLSN.
