Castro, M. E., et al. (1997). "Differential distribution of [3H]sumatriptan binding sites (5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors) in human brain: focus on brainstem and spinal cord." Neuropharmacology 36(4-5): 535-542.

	We report on the autoradiographic distribution of 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptor subtypes in human brain, focusing on the brainstem and cervical spinal cord. We have used [3H]sumatriptan as a radioligand in the presence of suitable concentrations of 5-CT (5-carboxamidotryptamine) to define 5-HT1F receptors, and ketanserin, to discriminate between 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. In the brainstem the highest concentrations of [3H]sumatriptan binding sites were seen in substantia nigra. The spinal trigeminal nucleus, substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord, nucleus of the tractus solitarius and periaqueductal grey, also showed significant levels of [3H]sumatriptan binding sites. In the brainstem and spinal cord the total population of 5-CT-insensitive receptors, corresponding to 5-HT1F receptors, ranged from 9.8% in the periaqueductal grey to 53.4% in the substantia gelatinosa. This population represented 67.0% of binding in layer V of the frontal cortex. The decrease in [3H]sumatriptan binding in the presence of 200 nM ketanserin, indicative of the presence of 5-HT1D receptors, was very limited throughout the human brain, only reaching 20% of total specific binding over the periaqueductal grey. The proportion of [3H]sumatriptan binding sites displaced by 5-CT and insensitive to ketanserin, corresponding to 5-HT1B receptors, was, in general, the most abundant, ranging from 43.8% in substantia gelatinosa to 69.9% in the periaqueductal grey. Significant levels of 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors found in migraine control pain areas suggest their involvement in antinociceptive mechanisms.
