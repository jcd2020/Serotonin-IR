	Murray KC, Stephens MJ, Rank M, D'Amico J, Gorassini MA, Bennett DJ. Polysynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials that trigger spasms after spinal cord injury in rats are inhibited by 5-HT1B and 5-HT1F receptors. J Neurophysiol 106: 925-943, 2011. First published June 8, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.01011.2010.-Sensory afferent transmission and associated spinal reflexes are normally inhibited by serotonin (5-HT) derived from the brain stem. Spinal cord injury (SCI) that eliminates this 5-HT innervation leads to a disinhibition of sensory transmission and a consequent emergence of unusually long polysynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in motoneurons. These EPSPs play a critical role in triggering long polysynaptic reflexes (LPRs) that initiate muscles spasms. In the present study we examined which 5-HT receptors modulate the EPSPs and whether these receptors adapt to a loss of 5-HT after chronic spinal transection in rats. The EPSPs and associated LPRs recorded in vitro in spinal cords from chronic spinal rats were consistently inhibited by 5-HT1B or 5-HT1F receptor agonists, including zolmitriptan (5-HT1B/1D/1F) and LY344864 (5-HT1F), with a sigmoidal dose-response relation, from which we computed the 50% inhibition (EC50) and potency (-log EC50). The potencies of 5-HT receptor agonists were highly correlated with their binding affinity to 5-HT1B and 5-HT1F receptors, and not to other 5-HT receptors. Zolmitriptan also inhibited the LPRs and general muscle spasms recorded in vivo in the awake chronic spinal rat. The 5-HT1B receptor antagonists SB216641 and GR127935 and the inverse agonist SB224289 reduced the inhibition of LPRs by 5-HT1B agonists (zolmitriptan). However, when applied alone, SB224289, SB216641, and GR127935 had no effect on the LPRs, indicating that 5-HT1B receptors do not adapt to chronic injury, remaining silent, without constitutive activity. The reduction in EPSPs with zolmitriptan unmasked a large glycine-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) after SCI. This IPSC and associated chloride current reversed at -73 mV, slightly below the resting membrane potential. Zolmitriptan did not change motoneuron properties. Our results demonstrate that 5-HT1B/1F agonists, such as zolmitriptan, can restore inhibition of sensory transmission after SCI without affecting general motoneuron function and thus may serve as a novel class of antispastic drugs.
