	Clinical studies suggest that 5-HT1A receptor function may be blunted in depression, while 5-HT1A agonists may possess antidepressant activity. Preclinical findings implicate changes in 5-HT1A receptor sensitivity in the mechanism of antidepressant action. The hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depression could be related to those observations, since 5-HT1A receptors are inhibited by glucocorticoids. To evaluate the interaction of the HPA and 5-HT1A systems, we pretreated 15 unipolar depressed patients and 12 healthy control subjects with the antiglucocorticoid ketoconazole (KTCZ) prior to administration of a test dose of the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone (IPS). Neuroendocrine (ACTH, cortisol, growth hormone), physiological (hypothermia), and behavioral responses to IPS were assessed. As expected, KTCZ inhibited cortisol biosynthesis, but non-HPA responses to IPS were not enhanced. This study failed to show that glucocorticoid modulation of 5-HT1A receptor function is altered in depression.
