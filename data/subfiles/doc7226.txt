Lejeune, F., et al. (1993). "WAY 100,135 and (-)-tertatolol act as antagonists at both 5-HT1A autoreceptors and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in vivo." Eur J Pharmacol 240(2-3): 307-310.

	In binding studies, WAY 100,135 (N-tertiobutyl-3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazinyl]-2-phenylpropana mide) and (-)-tertatolol showed affinities (Ki) of 29 nM and 10 nM, respectively, at 5-HT1A receptors. In vivo, they both dose dependently blocked the flat-body posture and corticosterone secretion provoked by an action of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, S 14671 (1-[2-(2-thenoyl-amino)ethyl]-4-[1-(7- methoxynaphtyl)]piperazine), at postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. Alone, they exerted little effect. The firing rate of dorsal raphe neurones, which bear inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors, was reduced by S 14671 whereas it was not affected by WAY 100,135 and was increased by (-)-tertatolol. Both WAY 100,135 and (-)-tertatolol blocked the ability of S 14671 to inhibit raphe firing. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that WAY 100,135 and (-)-tertatolol behave as antagonists at both 5-HT1A autoreceptors and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in vivo.
