Hodge, C. W., et al. (2008). "Deletion of the 5-HT(3A)-receptor subunit blunts the induction of cocaine sensitization." Genes Brain Behav 7(1): 96-102.

	Serotonin (5-HT) receptors are classified into seven groups (5-HT(1-7)), comprising at least 14 structurally and pharmacologically distinct receptor subtypes. Pharmacological antagonism of ionotropic 5-HT(3) receptors has been shown to modulate both behavioral and neurochemical aspects of the induction of sensitization to cocaine. It is not known, however, if specific molecular subunits of the 5-HT(3) receptor influence the development of cocaine sensitization. To address this question, we studied the effects of acute and chronic intermittent cocaine administration in mice with a targeted deletion of the gene for the 5-HT(3A)-receptor subunit (5-HT(3A)-/-). 5-HT(3A) (-/-) mice showed blunted induction of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization as compared with wild-type littermate controls. 5-HT(3A) (-/-) mice did not differ from wild-type littermate controls on measures of basal motor activity or response to acute cocaine treatment. Enhanced locomotor response to saline injection following cocaine sensitization was observed equally in 5-HT(3A) (-/-) and wild-type mice suggesting similar conditioned effects associated with chronic cocaine treatment. These data show a role for the 5-HT(3A)-receptor subunit in the induction of behavioral sensitization to cocaine and suggest that the 5-HT(3A) molecular subunit modulates neurobehavioral adaptations to cocaine, which may underlie aspects of addiction.
