	The present study examined the effects of intra-PVN serotonin injection in mianserin-pretreated rats at the onset of the dark phase of light cycle on the structure of feeding behavior. The drugs were injected into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. The animals were maintained in a self-selection feeding paradigm and provided with freely available and separate sources of protein, carbohydrate, fat and water. The suppressive effect of 5-HT on carbohydrate intake was attenuated by mianserin at the beginning of the active (dark) feeding period. Mianserin-pretreatment increased the duration of carbohydrate and protein intake, but it was unable to block the effect of 5-HT on meal frequency and local rate of carbohydrate consumption. The present data suggests that carbohydrate intake may be in part mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT2A/2C receptors. However, the temporal characteristics of carbohydrate ingestion are mediated by another subpopulation of 5-HT receptors in the PVN and indicates a possibly adrenergic influence.
