Doat-Meyerhoefer, M. M., et al. (2005). "Effects of clozapine and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine [DOM] on 5-HT2A receptor expression in discrete brain areas." Pharmacol Biochem Behav 81(4): 750-757.

	Activation of 5-HT2A receptors has been shown to be an essential component of the discriminative stimulus effects of indoleamine and phenethylamine hallucinogens. The objective of the present study was to determine the neuroanatomical location of the 5HT2A receptors which may be responsible for the stimulus effects of the phenethylamine hallucinogen [-]2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine (DOM). It was hypothesized that brain areas containing altered 5-HT2A receptor expression in the context of a similar alteration in DOM-induced stimulus control might be important in mediating the stimulus effects of DOM. Fisher 344 rats were treated with either clozapine (25 mg/kg/day) or DOM (2 mg/kg/day) for 7 days, and the consequences of these drug treatment regimens on DOM-induced stimulus control and on 5-HT2A receptor expression in several brain areas were determined. Chronic administration of clozapine was associated with a wide-spread decrease in levels of 5-HT2A/2C receptors. Conversely, treatment with DOM had varied effects including a neuroanatomically selective decrease in 5-HT2A/2C receptor levels that was restricted to the olfactory nucleus. Both chronic treatment with DOM and clozapine decreased the stimulus effects of DOM. The present findings suggest a role for the olfactory nucleus in producing the stimulus effects of DOM.
