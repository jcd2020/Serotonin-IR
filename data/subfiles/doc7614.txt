Lopez-Rodriguez, M. L., et al. (2004). "Benzimidazole derivatives. Part 5: design and synthesis of new benzimidazole-arylpiperazine derivatives acting as mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT3 ligands." Bioorg Med Chem 12(19): 5181-5191.

	A series of new mixed benzimidazole-arylpiperazine derivatives were designed by incorporating in general structure III the pharmacophoric elements of 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(3) receptors. Compounds 1-11 were synthesized and evaluated for binding affinity at both serotoninergic receptors, all of them exhibiting high 5-HT(3)R affinity (K(i)=10-62nM), and derivatives with an o-alkoxy group in the arylpiperazine ring showing nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT(1A)R (K(i)=18-150nM). Additionally, all the synthesized compounds were selective over alpha(1)-adrenergic and dopamine D(2) receptors (K(i)>1000-10,000nM). Compound 3 was selected for further pharmacological characterization due to its interesting binding profile as mixed 5-HT(1A)/5-HT(3) ligand with high affinity for both receptors (5-HT(1A): K(i)=18.0nM, 5-HT(3): K(i)=27.2nM). In vitro and in vivo findings suggest that this compound acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT(1A)Rs and as a 5-HT(3)R antagonist. This novel mixed 5-HT(1A)/5-HT(3) ligand was also effective in preventing the cognitive deficits induced by muscarinic receptor blockade in a passive avoidance learning test, suggesting a potential interest in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.
