Lyubashina, O. A., et al. (2016). "Effects of 5-HT3 receptor blockade on visceral nociceptive neurons in the ventrolateral reticular field of the rat medulla oblongata." Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology 52(4): 313-325.

	The caudal ventrolateral reticular formation of the medulla oblongata is the first layer of visceral nociceptive processing. In experiments on rats, neuronal responses in this zone to nociceptive stimulation of the large intestine were examined and the effects of selective blockade of 5-HT3 receptors on these responses were assessed. By the character of responses to nociceptive colorectal stimulation (CRS), the recorded medullary neurons were divided into three groups-excited, inhibited and indifferent. Intravenous injection of 5-HT3 antagonist granisetron (1 and 2 mg/kg) as well as local application of this agent on the surface of the medulla oblongata (1.25 and 2.5 nmole) suppressed the background and evoked firing of CRS-excited reticular neurons in a dose-dependent manner but did not exert as pronounced influence on the cells inhibited by visceral nociceptive stimulation. Spike activity in the group of CRS-indifferent neurons under similar conditions was 5-HT3-independent. The results obtained provide evidence that 5-HT3 receptors mediate the facilitating effect of serotonin on supraspinal transmission of the abdominal nociceptive stimulus which, at least in part, is realized via selective activation of visceral medullary nociceptive neurons. A shutdown of this mechanism may underlie the analgesic effect of 5-HT3 antagonists in abdominal pain syndromes.
