Kennett, G. A., et al. (1995). "EFFECT OF SB 200646A, A 5-HT2C 5-HT2B RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, IN 2 CONFLICT MODELS OF ANXIETY." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 118(2): 178-182.

	SB 200646A is the first selective 5-HT2C/ 5-HT2B receptor antagonist and has previously been observed to have anxiolytic-like properties in the rat social interaction test. In the present study the effects of the compound in two conflict models of anxiety, the rat Geller-Seifter and marmoset conflict test, were examined. In the rat Geller-Seifter test, suppressed responding was increased by all doses of SB 200646A between 5 and 40 mg/kg PO when given 1 h pretest. Unsuppressed responding was slightly increased only at 10 mg/kg PO. Suppressed responding was also increased by the benzodiazepine anxiolytic, chlordiazepoxide, at 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg PO 1 h pretest. Unsuppressed responding was modestly increased by chlordiazepoxide only at 5 mg/kg PO. In the marmoset conflict test marmosets were trained to lever press for a palatable food reward. Lever pressing was subsequently suppressed by air puffs. In this procedure suppressed responding was increased by both the benzodiazepine anxiolytic diazepam at 2 and 5 mg/kg PO and SB 200646A after 10 and 20 mg/kg PO. Both treatments caused small increases in unsuppressed responding at 2 and 20 mg/kg PO respectively. Taken together with the previous effects of SB 200646A in the rat social interaction test, this is compelling evidence that 5-HT2C/2B receptor antagonists may possess anxiolytic properties.
