	Using a combination of RT - PCR and inverse-PCR techniques, we amplified, cloned and sequenced a full-length porcine 5-HT(1B) receptor cDNA derived from porcine cerebral cortex. Sequence analysis revealed 1170 bp encoding an open reading frame of 390 amino acids showing a 95% similarity with the human 5-HT(1B) receptor. The recombinant porcine 5-HT(1B) cDNA was expressed in monkey Cos-7 cells and its pharmacological profile was determined by radioligand binding assay using [(3)H]-GR125743. The affinities of several agonists (L694247>ergotamine > or =5-carboxamidotryptamine=dihydroergotamine=5-HT>CP122638=zolmitriptan>sumatriptan) and putative antagonists (GR127935>methiothepin>SB224289>>ritanserin>ketanserin > or =BRL15572) correlated highly with those described for the recombinant human 5-HT(1B) receptor. In membranes obtained from cells co-expressing the porcine 5-HT(1B) receptor and a mutant G(alphao)Cys(351)Ile protein, 5-HT and zolmitriptan increased, while the 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist SB224289 decreased basal [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding, thus showing inverse agonism. The potency of zolmitriptan in the [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assay (pEC(50): 7.64+/-0.04) agreed with its affinity in displacing the antagonist [(3)H]-GR125743 (pK(i): 7.36+/-0.07). The 5-HT(1B) receptor mRNA was observed by RT-PCR in several blood vessels, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and trigeminal ganglion. In situ hybridization performed in frontal cerebral cortex sections revealed the expression of 5-HT(1B) receptor mRNA in pyramidal cells. In conclusion, we have cloned and established the amino acid sequence, ligand binding profile and location of the porcine 5-HT(1B) receptor. This information may be useful in exploring the role of 5-HT(1B) receptor in pathophysiological processes relevant for novel drug discovery in diseases such as migraine.
