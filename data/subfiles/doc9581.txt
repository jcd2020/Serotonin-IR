Romero, G., et al. (1992). "Effect of prenatal exposure to tianeptine on different neurotransmitter receptors and 5-HT-stimulated inositol phosphate formation in rat brain." J Neural Transm Gen Sect 90(2): 113-124.

	Tianeptine, an antidepressant drug enhancing 5-HT uptake, was given to pregnant rats in the last 15 days of gestation and different neurotransmitter receptors as well as 5-HT2 receptor-linked inositol phosphate formation were measured in the brains of the offspring. Prenatal exposure to tianeptine significantly decreased the density of 3H-imipramine binding sites in the cerebral cortex of the pups without affecting beta-adrenoceptors, serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT1B receptors or inositol phosphate formation after a 5-HT challenge. Striatal dopamine D2 receptors labelled with 3H-spiroperidol were not changed but an apparent increase in the affinity of dopamine was noticed in the pups prenatally exposed to the drug. The results show that the neurochemical profile of tianeptine markedly differs from that of most antidepressants.
