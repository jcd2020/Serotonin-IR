	The identification of the brain structures and neurotransmitters responsible for the generation and/or modulation of P300 could lead to important clinical implications. Since serotonin disturbances seem to play a critical role in depression, the aim of the study was to assess the possible relationships between the P300 event-related brain potential and serotonergic activity in depression. The study was conducted among 45 major depressive inpatients, and serotonergic activity was assessed by prolactin (PRL) response to flesinoxan (a 5-HT1A agonist). Results showed a significant negative correlation between P300 amplitude and PRL response to flesinoxan (r = -0.40, P = 0.007 at Cz; r = -0.47, P = 0.001 at Pz). In contrast, both P300 latency and reaction time were not related to endocrine response. This study supports a role for serotonin-1A in the neurobiological modulation of P300 amplitude.
