Berendsen, H. H., et al. (1994). "Role of dorsal and median raphe nuclei in lower lip retraction in rats." Eur J Pharmacol 263(3): 315-318.

	Induction of lower lip retraction after local infusion of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei was measured. Infusion of 8-OH-DPAT (2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/rat) into the median raphe nucleus caused an immediate and dose-dependent lower lip retraction. After infusion into the dorsal raphe nucleus a higher dose was needed. The lowest dose of 8-OH-DPAT that induced lower lip retraction was 10 micrograms/rat. Infusion of 8-OH-DPAT (10 micrograms/rat) into the pontine reticular nucleus induced the same degree of lower lip retraction as seen after infusion of the compound into the dorsal raphe nucleus. 8-OH-DPAT-induced lower lip retraction was attenuated by s.c. injection of the preferential 5-HT2C receptor agonist m-chlorophenyl-piperazine. The results suggest that lower lip retraction is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors in the median rather than in the dorsal raphe nucleus.
