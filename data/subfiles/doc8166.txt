Matos, F. F., et al. (1996). "Serotonin (5-HT) release in the dorsal raphe and ventral hippocampus: raphe control of somatodendritic and terminal 5-HT release." J Neural Transm (Vienna) 103(1-2): 173-190.

	Somatodendritic and terminal release of serotonin (5-HT) was investigated by simultaneously measuring extracellular concentrations of 5-HT, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the dorsal raphe and ventral hippocampus in freely moving rats. Perfusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX, 1 microM and 10 microM) into the dorsal raphe simultaneously decreased dorsal raphe and hippocampal 5-HT release. However, following TTX perfusion into the hippocampus (10 microM), hippocampal 5-HT release was profoundly reduced but dorsal raphe 5-HT remained unchanged. Systemic injections with 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone (1.0-5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased 5-HT and 5-HIAA and increased HVA concentrations in the dorsal raphe and in the hippocampus. The decreases in the raphe and hippocampal 5-HT induced by systemic buspirone were antagonized in rats pretreated with 1.0 mM (-) pindolol, locally perfused into the dorsal raphe. Local dorsal raphe perfusion of (-) pindolol alone (0.01-1.0 mM) increased dorsal raphe 5-HT and concomitantly induced a small increase in hippocampal 5-HT. Buspirone perfusion into the dorsal raphe did not change (10 nM, 100 nM), or produced a small increase (1.0 mM) in raphe 5-HT, without changing hippocampal 5-HT. These data provide evidence that 5-HT release in the dorsal raphe is dependent on the opening of fast activated sodium channels and that dorsal raphe 5-HT1A receptors control somatodendritic and hippocampal 5-HT release
