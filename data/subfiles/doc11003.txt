	Purpose: Memory deficits and depression are common in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies have shown reduced mesial temporal 5HT1A-receptor binding in these patients. We examined the relationships among verbal memory performance, depression, and 5HT1A-receptor binding measured with 18F-trans-4-fluoro-N-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane carboxamide (18FCWAY) PET in a cross-sectional study. Methods: We studied 40 patients (24 male; mean age 34.5 +/- 10.7 years) with TLE. Seizure diagnosis and focus localization were based on ictal video- electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Patients had neuropsychological testing with Wechsler Adult Intelligence Score III (WAIS III) and Wechsler Memory Score III (WMS III) on stable antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens at least 24 h since the last seizure. Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores were obtained. We performed interictal PET with 18FCWAY, a fluorinated derivative of WAY 100635, a highly specific 5HT1A ligand, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to estimate partial volume and plasma free fraction corrected 18FCWAY volume of distribution (V/f1). Key Findings: Hippocampal V/f1 was significantly lower in area ipsilateral than contralateral to the epileptic focus (73.7 +/- 27.3 vs. 95.4 +/- 28.4; p < 0.001). We found a significant relation between both left hippocampal 18FCWAY V/f1 (r = 0.41; p < 0.02) and left hippocampal volume (r = 0.36; p < 0.03) and delayed auditory memory score. On multiple regression, there was a significant effect of the interaction of left hippocampal 18FCWAY V/f1 and left hippocampal volume on delayed auditory memory, but not of either alone. High collinearity was present. In an analysis of variance including the side of the seizure focus, the effect of left hippocampal 18FCWAY V/f1 but not focus laterality retained significance. Mean BDI was 8.3 +/- 7.0. There was a significant inverse relation between BDI and 18FCWAY V/f1 ipsilateral to the patient's epileptic focus (r = 0.38 p < 0.02). There was no difference between patients with a right or left temporal focus. There was no relation between BDI and immediate or delayed auditory memory. Significance: Our study suggests that reduced left hippocampal 5HT1A- receptor binding may play a role in memory impairment in patients with TLE.
