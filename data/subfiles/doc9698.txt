	This study investigated the effects of repeated amphetamine treatment on locomotor activity and behavioral inhibition in the elevated plus-maze, and the influence of serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission on these behaviors. Acute administration of amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg subcutaneously [SC]) stimulated locomotor activity, which was attenuated by acute citalopram (5.0 mg/kg SC) pretreatment. Repeated daily treatment with amphetamine (15 days) sensitized the rats to the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation. Acute pretreatment with the 5-HT precursor 1-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP; 25 mg/kg IP) or chronic treatment with the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor citalopram (5.0 mg/kg SC, twice daily), did not after the expression of amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization, rn the elevated plus-maze, animals subjected to repeated amphetamine treatment expressed behavioral disinhibition after amphetamine exposure (1.0 mg/kg SC; -35 min), which was antagonized both by acute 5-HTP and chronic citalopram treatment. In summary, these findings suggest that behavioral sensitization to amphetamine is associated with amphetamine-induced behavioral disinhibition, and that acute 5-HTP as well as chronic citalopram treatment counteract the expression of amphetamine-induced behavioral disinhibition, but not locomotor sensitization. It appears likely that the antagonistic effects of 5-HTP and citalopram on behavioral disinhibition derive from a drug-induced facilitation of brain 5-HT neurotransmission.
