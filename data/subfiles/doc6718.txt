	Serotonergic fibers and receptors appear in the rat cerebellum during early postnatal development. In the present study, we investigated the actions of serotonin (5-HT) and its receptors in the dendrite formation of Purkinje cells in organotypic cultures of anterior and posterior lobes of the cerebellum at postnatal day 7. In anterior lobes after 4 days in vitro (4DIV), the dendritic areas and branchings of Purkinje cells were increased by the treatment of 2 microM 5-HT, but decreased by 20 microM 5-HT. In posterior lobes after 4DIV, the dendritic areas of Purkinje cells were increased by 5-HT (2, 20 and 200 microM). In contrast, 5-HT treatment decreased dendritic areas of Purkinje cells in both anterior and posterior lobes after 7DIV. Next, we determined the actions of specific 5-HT receptors in mediating the effects of 5-HT by treatment with selective 5-HT receptor agonists. In anterior lobes after 4DIV, dendritic areas of Purkinje cells were increased by a 5-HT1A receptor agonist (8-OH-DPAT), whereas decreased by a 5-HT2A receptor agonist (DOI). The present study suggested that the dendrite formation of Purkinje cells is promoted by 5-HT through 5-HT1A receptors, but inhibited by 5-HT through 5-HT2A receptors.
