Barrett, K. T., et al. (2012). "Subtle alterations in breathing and heart rate control in the 5-HT1A receptor knockout mouse in early postnatal development." J Appl Physiol (1985) 113(10): 1585-1593.

	We hypothesized that absence of the 5-HT(1A) receptor would negatively affect the development of cardiorespiratory control. In conscious wild type (WT) and 5-HT(1A) receptor knockout (KO) mice, we measured resting ventilation (Ve), oxygen consumption (Vo(2)), heart rate (HR), breathing and HR variability, and the hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR) at postnatal day 5 (P5), day 15 (P15), and day 25 (P25). In KO mice compared with WT, we found a 17% decrease in body weight at only P5 (P < 0.01) and no effect on Vo(2). Ve was significantly (P < 0.001) lower at P5 and P25, but there was no effect on the HCVR. Breathing variability (interbreath interval), measured by standard deviation, the root mean square of the standard deviation (RMSSD), and the product of the major (L) and minor axes (T) of the Poincare first return plot, was 57% to 187% higher only at P5 (P < 0.001). HR was 6-10% slower at P5 (P < 0.001) but 7-9% faster at P25 (P < 0.001). This correlated with changes in the spectral analysis of HR variability; the low frequency to high frequency ratio was 47% lower at P5 but 68% greater at P25. The RMSSD and (L x T) of HR variability were ~2-fold greater at P5 only (P < 0.001; P < 0.05). We conclude that 5-HT(1A) KO mice have a critical period of potential vulnerability at P5 when pups hypoventilate and have a slower respiratory frequency and HR with enhanced variability of both, suggesting abnormal maturation of cardiorespiratory control.
