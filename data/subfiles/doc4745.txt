	Motoneuron membrane potentials were recorded from the ventral roots of isolated, hemisected frog spinal cords using sucrose gap techniques. The effects of the selective 5-HT3 agonist 2-methyl-serotonin (2-Me-5HT) on the changes in motoneuron membrane potential produced by dorsal root stimulation and by superfusion of excitatory amino acid agonists were evaluated. Application of 2-Me-5HT (100 microM) did not alter motoneuron membrane potential, but did substantially reduce (approximately 20%) the polysynaptic ventral root potentials evoked by dorsal root stimulation. 2-Me-5HT did not change motoneuron depolarizations generated by addition to the Ringer's solution of the excitatory amino acid agonists AMPA (10-30 microM), kainate (30 microM), or t-ACPD (100 microM), but NMDA-induced motoneuron depolarizations (100 microM) were significantly and reversibly reduced (approximately 20%) by exposure to 2-Me-5HT (100 microM). 2-Me-5HT-evoked decreases of NMDA depolarizations were blocked by the 5-HT3 antagonists ICS 205 930 (50-100 microM) and D-tubocurarine (3-10 microM), but not by MDL 72222 (20-100 microM), the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (10 microM), or the 5-HT1A/5-HT2A antagonist spiperone (10 microM). Two lines of evidence support the hypothesis that the effects of 2-Me-5HT are generated by an indirect mechanism involving interneurons: (1) TTX (0.781 microM) eliminated the effect of 2-Me-5HT on NMDA-induced motoneuron depolarizations, and (2) 2-Me-5HT reduced spontaneous ventral root potentials that result from interneuronal discharges. We attempted to establish the identity of a putative transmitter released by interneurons responsible for the effects on NMDA-depolarizations produced by 2-Me-5HT, but the AMPA receptor antagonist, CNQX (10 microM), the GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (50 microM), the GABAB receptor antagonist, saclofen (100 microM), the opioid antagonist, naloxone (100 microM), and the adenosine antagonists, CPT (20-100 microM) and CSC (10-100 microM) did not alter 2-Me-5HT-induced reductions of NMDA-depolarizations. In sum, the site of interaction between 2-Me-5HT and NMDA appears to be at interneuronal locus, but the mechanism remains unclear.
