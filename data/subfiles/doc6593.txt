Lopez-Meraz, M. L., et al. (2006). "Indorenate modifies a(1)-adrenergic and benzodiazepine receptor binding in the rat brain: an autoradiography study." Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology 58(9): 1243-1248.

	Indorenate (5-methoxytryptamine-ss-methylcarboxylate) is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist that produces anti hypertensive, anxiolytic, antidepressant and anticonvulsant effects. However, there is evidence suggesting that these effects could involve the activation of benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors but not the activation of a(1)-adrenergic receptors. The goal of this study was to analyse the effect of inclorenate on a(1)-adrenergic and BZD receptor binding in specific rat brain areas by using in-vitro autoradiography. Coronal brain sections from male Wistar rats were used for labelling 5-HT1A (H-3-8-OH-DFAT, 2 nM), a(1)-adrenergic (H-3-prazosin, 2 nM) and BZD (H-3-flunitrazepam, 2 nM) receptor binding in the presence or absence of inclorenate (1 mu m). Indorenate totally displaced H-3-8-OH-DPAT binding in all the brain areas evaluated. It decreased H-3-prazosin binding just in the frontal (30%) and sensorimotor (32%) cortices and in the thalamus (21%). Additionally, inclorenate diminished H-3-flunitrazepam binding only in the cingulate (16%) and piriform (18%) cortices as well as in the dorsal raphe nucleus (18%). These results confirm that inclorenate is a 5-HT1A ligand and suggest the possible participation of a(1)-adrenergic and BZD receptors in its pharmacological properties.
