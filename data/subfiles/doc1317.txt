Bonisch, H., et al. (1993). "CHARACTERIZATION OF 5-HT3 RECEPTORS OF N1E-115 NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS BY USE OF THE INFLUX OF THE ORGANIC CATION C-14 GUANIDINIUM." Br J Pharmacol 108(2): 436-442.

	1 The 5-HT3 receptor-mediated cation influx into N1E-115 mouse neuroblastoma c 2 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, 30 muM) caused a time-dependent influx of [C-14]-guanidinium which, in contrast to the influx elicited by veratridine (100 muM), was not inhibited by tetrodotoxin (TTX, 10 muM). The 5-HT-induced influx was potentiated by substance P and inhibited by ondansetron. 3 5-HT and the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonists, m-chloro-phenylbiguanide, phenylbiguanide and 2-methyl-5-HT caused bell-shaped concentration-response curves; the rank order of potency was m-chlorophenylbiguanide > 5-HT > phenylbiguanide = 2-methyl-5-HT. Among these agonists, 5-HT elicited the highest influx of [C-14]-guanidinium. 5-Methoxytryptamine, an agonist at 5-HT4 receptors, showed no effect. 4 The [C-14]-guanidinium influx induced by 100 muM 5-HT was not affected by methysergide (10 muM) and ketanserin (10 muM) but was inhibited by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with the following rank order of potency: ICS 205-930 > ondansetron > MDL 72222 much greater than metoclopramide. 5 The 5-HT-induced [C-14]-guanidinium influx was increased in the absence of Ca2+ and/or Na+ and by a reduction of the temperature from 36-degrees to 20-degrees-C. 6 Preincubation with 5-HT (100 muM) caused a time-dependent and rapidly reversible decrease of the 5-HT-induced [C-14]-guanidinium influx. 7 It is concluded that [C-14]-guanidinium influx measurement in N1E-115 cells is a convenient method to study properties of the cation channel of the 5-HT3 receptor. This influx is independent of the fast sodium channel.
