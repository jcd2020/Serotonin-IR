	The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on the responses of red nucleus (RN) neurones to glutamate (glu) and its agonists were studied using a microiontophoretic technique in anaesthetised rats. Extracellular unitary recordings of RN neuronal activity showed that 5-HT application induced a significant and reversible depression of glu-evoked excitations in 85% of the RN units tested. This effect was independent of the action of the amine on background firing, which appeared enhanced in the majority of cases but was either depressed or uninfluenced in other cases. Microiontophoretic 5-HT also depressed the excitatory responses evoked in RN neurones by electrical stimulation of sensorimotor cortex. Methysergide application, which prevented the enhancing effects of 5-HT on the background firing, was scarcely effective in antagonising the depression of glu responses. In contrast, the serotonergic effects on the glu responses were reduced by the iontophoretically applied antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors, NAN-190. Microiontophoretic 5-HT was also able to influence the neuronal responses evoked by glu agonists quisqualate (quis) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), acting on non-NMDA and NMDA receptors respectively. In fact 5-HT depressed quis-evoked excitations and induced mixed effects on NMDA responses, which were reduced in 45%, enhanced in 34% and unmodified in 21% of the units tested. These results suggest that 5-HT is able to modulate the motor glutamatergic input to RN by acting mostly on non-NMDA receptors. The modulation of non-NMDA and NMDA receptors by 5-HT in the RN appears significant and its functional meaning is discussed.
