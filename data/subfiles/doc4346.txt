Harrington, M. A., et al. (1988). "5-Hydroxytryptamine1A receptors are linked to a Gi-adenylate cyclase complex in rat hippocampus." Eur J Pharmacol 154(1): 95-98.

	The ability of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and the 5-HT1A selective agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) to modulate adenylate cyclase activity was measured in rat hippocampus. In vitro ADP ribosylation of GTP-binding proteins by pertussis toxin in this tissue abolished both 5-HT- and 8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. These findings indicate that 5-HT1A receptors are linked a pertussis-sensitive Gi protein in rat hippocampus.
