	In the present study, we investigated the role of 5-HT3 and 5-HT2C receptors located within the medial amygdala (MeA) in the control of water and salt intake in sodium-depleted rats. Pharmacological activation of 5-HT3 receptors located in the medial amygdala by the selective 5-HT3 receptor agonist m-CPBG significantly reduced salt intake in sodium-depleted rats, an effect that is reverted by pretreatment with the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. In addition, the injection of ondansetron alone into the medial amygdala had no effect on salt intake in sodium-depleted and in sodium-repleted rats. Pharmacological stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors located in the medial amygdala by the selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist m-CPP failed to modify salt intake in sodium-depleted rats, whereas the blockade of these receptors by the selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SDZ SER 082 significantly reduced salt intake in this same group of animals. These results lead to the conclusion that the pharmacological activation of 5-HT3 receptors located within the MeA inhibits salt intake in sodium-depleted rats and that, in this same brain region, the functional integrity of 5-HT2C receptors is required to achieve the full expression of sodium appetite in sodium-depleted rats.
