Sibon, I., et al. (2008). "Decreased F-18 MPPF binding potential in the dorsal raphe nucleus after a single oral dose of fluoxetine: A positron-emission tomography study in healthy volunteers." Biol Psychiatry 63(12): 1135-1140.

	Background: Brain serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptors internalize when activated by agonist or by their endogenous ligand, serotonin. This positron-emission tomography (PET) study tested the hypothesis that 5-HT1A auto receptor internalization might be indexed in vivo by a decrease in the specific binding of the 5-HT1A radioligand, 4-[18F]fluoro-N-[2-[1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1 piperazinyl]ethyl-N-2-pyridinyl-benzamide ([F-18]MPPF), in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of healthy adult men administered a single oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. Methods: [F-18]MPPF binding potential was measured in the DRN and other brain regions endowed with 5-HT1A receptors in eight healthy volunteers, 5 hours after the randomized, double-blind administration of fluoxetine (20 mg) or placebo. Results: In every subject, [F-18]MPPF binding potential was decreased in the DRN only (44% +/- 22 SD), in response to fluoxetine. Conclusions: Imaging the functional state of 5-HT1A autoreceptors (i.e., internalization) in the human brain, using [F-18]MPPF/PET, may represent a promising avenue for investigating the neurobiology of serotonin-related disorders and notably of major depression.
