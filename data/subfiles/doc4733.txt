	Previous studies have suggested a disturbance in the cortical serotonergic (5-HT) system in schizophrenia; however, these studies have been confounded by suicide in the patients groups, which in itself is associated with alterations in the 5-HT system. In this study we characterized various components of the 5-HT system in 14 areas of the frontal and parietal cortex in tissue obtained at postmortem from aged chronically hospitalized nonsuicidal schizophrenics compared to age-matched controls. We found no differences between control and schizophrenic subjects in the density of 5-HT uptake sites or other markers of 5-HT innervation. In Brodmann areas 24 and 6 the concentration of 5-HT2A,C receptors was decreased in all schizophrenics regardless of their antipsychotic treatment history. In all other areas examined 5-HT2A,C receptor concentrations were dramatically decreased in schizophrenics patients on drugs at time of death, whereas those off drugs at death showed the same values as control subjects. The density of 5-HT1A receptors was increased in areas 24, 9a (caudal part of area 9), 44, and 6 in subjects with schizophrenia. Antipsychotic treatment did not appear to have a significant effect. Thus, the specific pattern of alterations in the 5-HT system in schizophrenia may depend on the patient population and on antemortem antipsychotic treatment. These data also provide evidence that regulation of the 5-HT2 receptor may be involved in antipsychotic action.
