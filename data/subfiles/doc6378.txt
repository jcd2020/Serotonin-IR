	The 5-HT7 receptor is the most recently discovered receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and only little is known about the analgesic potential of this receptor. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) modulates pain transmission by activating P2X/P2Y receptors, in which the P2X(3) subtype is an important target for this effect. This study examined the antihyperalgesic effect of the 5-HT7 receptors in the ventrolateral midbrain periaqueductal gray (vIPAG), a crucial site for endogenous pain inhibition. This study also explored the importance of the interactions between the 5-HT7 and P2X3 receptors in this effect To address this issue, neuropathic pain was induced through chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. The expression level and distribution of the 5-HT7 receptor were evaluated through Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) was measured by using an electronic pressure meter test. Different doses (3, 6, and 12 mu mol) of AS-19, a selective agonist of the 5-HT7 receptor, were administered in the v1PAG of CCI rats. The effects of pretreatment with the selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 or the selective P2X3 receptor antagonist A-317491 on the analgesic effect of AS-19 were observed. Results showed that CCI decreased the MINT values of the rats. The injury also increased the protein level of the 5-HT7 receptor in the v1PAG of neuropathic pain rats. AS-19 microinjection significantly elevated the MINT values in a dose-dependent manner, but SB-269970 pretreatment attenuated the antihyperalgesic effect of AS-19. Furthermore, the antihyperalgesic effect of the 5-HT7 receptor was partially but significantly blocked by A-317491 pretreatment. These data indicate that the 5-HT7 receptor in the vIPAG exerts an antihyperalgesic effect on rats with neuropathic pain. The 5-HT7 and P2X3 receptors interact in the v1PAG and exhibit an analgesic action through the enhanced function of the endogenous analgesic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.
