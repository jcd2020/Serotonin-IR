	Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disorder, but its pathophysiology remains unknown. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) is an important neurotransmitter involved in the brain-gut connection. Alosetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, has been demonstrated in randomized, placebo-controlled trials (RCT) to be effective in diarrhea-predominant IBS(IBS-D). Constipation is the most common adverse event. Alosetron improved abdominal pain and discomfort and stool consistency in both female and male patients, but it did not improve other symptoms (sense of urgency, stool frequency and bloating) in male patients. Although less is known about the gender differences in therapeutic benefit, a new 5-HT3 antagonist, cilansetron, has demonstrated effectiveness in male and female IBS-D patients and is currently under clinical trials.
