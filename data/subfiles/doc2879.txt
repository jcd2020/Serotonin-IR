"5-Hydroxytryptamine2A/2C receptors of nucleus raphe magnus and gigantocellularis/paragigantocellularis pars alpha reticular nuclei modulate the unconditioned fear-induced antinociception evoked by electrical stimulation of deep layers of the superior colliculus and dorsal periaqueductal grey matter." Behav Brain Res 316: 294-304.

	The electrical stimulation of the dorsolateral columns of the periaquedutal grey matter (dlPAG) or deep layers of the superior colliculus (dlSC) evokes defensive behaviours followed by an antinociceptive response. Monoaminergic brainstem reticular nuclei are suggested to comprise the endogenous pain modulatory system. The aim of the present work was to investigate the role played by 5-HT2 subfamily of serotonergic receptors of the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) and the gigantocellularis/paragigantocellularis pars alpha reticular nuclei (Gi/PGialpha) in the elaboration of instinctive fear-induced antinociception elicited by electrical stimulation of dlPAG or of dlSC. The nociceptive thresholds were measured by the tail-flick test in Wistar rats. The 5-HT2A/2C-serotonergic receptors antagonist ritanserin was microinjected at different concentrations (0.05, 0.5 and 5.0mug/0.2muL) either in Gi/PGialpha or in NRM. The blockade of 5-HT2 receptors in both Gi/PGialpha and NRM decreased the innate fear-induced antinociception elicited by electrical stimulation of the dlSC or the dlPAG. These findings indicate that serotonin is involved in the hypo-algesia induced by unconditioned fear-induced behavioural responses and the 5-HT2A/2C-serotonergic receptor subfamily in neurons situated in the Gi/PGialpha complex and NRM are critically recruited in pain modulation during the panic-like emotional behaviour.
