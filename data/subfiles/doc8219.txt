	OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of Yokukansan (YKS) extract on two endogenous modulators of anxiety, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and serotonin (5-HT)(2A) receptors pharmacologically, in the ischemic rat model of dementia. METHODS: The cerebral ischemia (CI) was induced by bilateral occlusion of the vertebral and common carotid arteries (4-vessel occlusion ischemia). The CI was combined with the amyloid-beta 42 peptide (A beta 42) injected intracerebroventricularly, and referred to as CI + A beta. Anxiety-like behaviors were assessed by elevated plus maze (enclosed arm), light/dark transition test (dark chamber), and open-field test. Wet-dog shakes were induced by the 5-HT2A receptor agonist 2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI). The concentration of BDNF in serum was determined by enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay. RESULTS: CI + A beta increased anxiety, as demonstrated by the increase of time spent in the enclosed arms and dark chambers, and locomotion in the outer zone of the open field (thigmotaxis). CI +A beta decreased the serum concentration of BDNF. YKS reduced the anxiety-like behaviors, suppressed the DOI-induced wet-dog shakes and increased serum BDNF concentrations. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that YKS extract improves CI + A beta-induced anxiety by antagonizing 5-HT2A receptors and increasing BDNF. (C) 2019 JTCM. All rights reserved.
