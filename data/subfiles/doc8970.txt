Moser, P. C., et al. (1996). "Reversal of amphetamine-induced behaviours by MDL 100,907, a selective 5-HT2A antagonist." Behav Brain Res 73(1-2): 163-167.

	MDL 100,907 is a potent and selective antagonist of the 5-HT2A receptor which, unlike other antagonists at this receptor, has little affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor. We have investigated the antipsychotic potential of MDL 100,907 by examining its ability to antagonise different behavioural effects of amphetamine in rats. MDL 100,907 reversed the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine in rats without itself having any effect on locomotor activity. It also antagonised the disruptive effects of amphetamine on the development of latent inhibition. In contrast, MDL 100,907 had no effect on the discriminative stimulus properties of amphetamine, nor did it affect the ability of amphetamine to reduce the threshold required to sustain rewarding brain stimulation in the ventral tegmental area. This profile is different from that of typical and atypical neuroleptics, and also from other 5-HT2 receptor antagonists, which lack the selectivity of MDL 100,907. These results suggest that MDL 100,907 may have a unique interaction with dopaminergic systems and support the further development of selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonists as a novel therapeutic strategy for schizophrenia.
