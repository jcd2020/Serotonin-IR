	The observations that hallucinogenic drugs are in fact serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists and atypical antipsychotic drugs antagonize 5-HT2A receptors in addition to dopamine D-2-like receptors, led to envisage a close relationship between schizophrenia and serotonin transmission. Post mortem studies have shown diminished 5-HT2A receptor binding in brain tissue from people with schizophrenia. If these changes also occur in schizophrenia, the decreased 5-HT2A binding might be a compensatory effect resulting from increased cortical serotonergic transmission. Therefore, schizophrenic personality was associated to an excess of brain serotonin. Overall, such data suggests that 5-HT systems may play a role in the etiology and therapy of some aspects of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is no simple hypothesis of schizophrenia involving a single transmitter dysfunction in the brain. Thus, although initial views suggest increased serotonergic and dopaminergic transmission over 5-HT2A and D-2 receptors in schizophrenia, current hypotheses for both etiology and treatment of the disease also implicate 5-HT1A and D-2 receptor partial agonism in the development of novel antipsychotics with a better therapeutic profile and fewer adverse effects. In this chapter we review the role that serotonin and 5-HT2A receptors play in schizophrenia as well as the most relevant schizophreniarelated behavioral effects induced by hallucinogen drugs in rodents, focusing on those that involve a 5-HT2A receptor mechanism.
