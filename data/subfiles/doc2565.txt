	AIM: To study the effect of S-21007, a 5-HT3 partial agonist in different animal models of anxiety in mice. METHODS: S-21007 effects were evaluated in the behavior tests after intraperitioneal and oral acute treatment or in the light/dark test after both acute and chronic treatments. RESULTS: S-21007 presented anxiolytic-like properties after acute administration in the light/dark box test, the mirrored chamber test, and the elevated plus-maze at low doses 10 ng.kg(-1) - 100 mu g.kg(-1), 1 - 100 mu g.kg(-1) and 10 - 100 mu g.kg(-1) respectively. In the light/dark box test, S-21001 was active orally after acute treatment at 100 ng kg(-1) - 10 mg kg(-1) and after chronic treatment (14 d) at 1-10 mu g.kg(-1). S-21007 was devoid of sedative or stimulatory effects. CONCLUSION: S-21007 exhibited anxiolytic-like properties. The mechanism of action may be a desensitization of 5-HT3 receptor or an antagonist activity on the 5-HT3 receptors.
