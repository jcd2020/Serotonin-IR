Gurguis, G. N. M., et al. (1998). "Effects of serotonin and metergoline on (125) I -iodocyanopindolol binding parameters to beta-adrenergic receptors in rat brain." European Neuropsychopharmacology 8(2): 131-140.

	Most ligands which have been employed to investigate the regulation of beta-adrenergic receptors (beta AR) under pathophysiological conditions and in response to pharmacological manipulations have also been shown to have affinity for 5-HT1B receptors. We examined the effects of serotonin and metergoline (10 mu M) on I-125-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP, 5-100 pM) binding to beta AR in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus membranes. In both brain regions, the presence of either serotonin or metergoline significantly lowered iodocyanopindolol dissociation constant (K-d) and maximum binding capacity (B-max). Isoproterenol displacement curves showed that the decrease in receptor density was primarily due to a significant decrease in the receptors in the low-conformational state. Thus, a significant fraction of the apparent ICYP binding to beta AR in the low-conformational state was due to binding to 5-HT1B receptors. Neither serotonin nor metergoline had an effect on the agonist isoproterenol dissociation constant from beta AR in either conformational state. Published by Elsevier Science B.V./ECNP.
