Key, B. J. and C. C. Wigfield (1992). "Changes in the tail surface temperature of the rat following injection of 5-hydroxytryptamine into the ventrolateral medulla." Neuropharmacology 31(8): 717-723.

	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was injected into the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in urethane-anaesthetized rats and its effect assessed on thermoregulatory and non-thermoregulatory cutaneous circulations by the measurement of skin surface temperatures. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-50 nmol) produced a dose-related fall in blood pressure (5-20 mmHg) and an increase in tail and plantar foot surface temperatures, indicative of dilatation in the underlying cutaneous circulations. If heat was not applied to the animal, the body temperature fell by 1-2 degrees C within 15-25 min. The decrease in tail and foot temperatures, produced by low frequency (25 Hz, 5 min) electrical stimulation, was antagonized by the injection of 5-HT at the site of stimulation. 5-Carboxyamidotryptamine (2.5-20 nmol) and flesinoxan (5-25 nmol) produced responses similar to 5-HT. The 5-HT2 receptor agonist, alpha-methyl 5-hydroxytryptamine (alpha-methyl 5-HT, 5.5-100 nmol) was only effective in increasing tail and plantar foot temperatures, at dose levels above 25 nmol. However, in a few sites restricted to the anterior region of the RVLM, alpha-methyl 5-HT (11 nmol) evoked a small decrease in tail and foot temperatures, indicative of a constrictor effect, without influencing resting cardiovascular parameters. The results are discussed in relation to the central mechanisms which underly the hypothermia and hyperthermia produced by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor agonists.
