Neale, R. F., et al. (1987). "Biochemical and pharmacological characterization of CGS 12066B, a selective serotonin-1B agonist." Eur J Pharmacol 136(1): 1-9.

	CGS 12066B is a novel pyrroloquinoxaline with selectivity for the serotonin-1B (5HT1B) recognition site as assessed by binding, biochemical and electrophysiological studies. The compound had an IC50 value of 51 nM at the 5HT1B recognition site as determined using the binding of [3H]5HT in the presence of 1 microM spiperone. At the 5HT1A receptor the compound had an IC50 value of 876 nM, providing a 5HT1A/5HT1B ratio of 17 in contrast to the putative 5HT1B selective agent trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) which had a corresponding ratio of 3.6. The compound had minimal affinity for alpha 1-, alpha 2- and beta-adrenoceptors and for dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors. CGS 12066B, in contrast to TFMPP, which was inactive, was found to inhibit dorsal raphe cell firing with an ED50 value of 358 nmol/kg i.v. The corresponding values for the 5HT1A selective agonists 8-OH-DPAT and ipsapirone were 1.3 and 33 nmol/kg. CGS 12066B was also effective in decreasing rat brain 5-HTP concentrations and inhibiting in vitro 5HT release. The data obtained indicate that CGS 12066B is a reasonably active 5HT1B site agonist, which due to its selectivity as compared to compounds such as TFMPP, will be a useful tool for evaluating the physiological role of such receptors in the mammalian CNS.
