	In this paper we discuss 1) the primary structures, pharmacology, and brain distribution of cloned 5-HT4 receptors; 2) the chromosomal localization of the h5-HT4 receptor; 3) wether benzamides are full or partial agonists because of a species or a coupling difference; 4) the intrinsic activity of 5-HT4 receptors and inverse agonism of GR125487 in COS-7 cells but not in colliculi neurons; 5) the modulation of 5-HT4 receptor binding and activity; and 6) the long-term blockade of K+ channels by 5-HT4 agonists and its effect on olfactory memory We conclude that 1) the cloning of 5-HT4 receptors in different species using RT-PCR from different tissues reveals the presence of several splice variants for 5-HT4 receptors differing in the C-terminal part, downstream from the amino acid L-358; 2) the pharmacological properties of 5-HT4 receptors are dependent on the cellular contest in which they are expressed; and 3) 5-HT4 agonists can be added to the list of compounds having pro-cognitive properties.
