	Neuroendocrine responses to stimulation with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (citalopram) were measured to investigate the effects of all-night sleep deprivation on serotonergic function in healthy male subjects (n=7). We studied citalopram-stimulated prolactin and cortisol plasma concentrations in a placebo-controlled cross-over protocol following sleep and sleep deprivation. Citalopram infusion (20 mg i.v. at 14:20-14: 50 h) after a night of undisturbed sleep prompted robust increases in both plasma prolactin and cortisol concentrations. Following a night of sleep deprivation, by contrast, the citalopram-induced prolactin response was blunted, but the cortisol response was not significantly altered. This differential response pattern relates to the distinct pathways through which serotonin may activate the corticotrophic and the lactotrophic systems. While an unchanged cortisol response does not indicate (but also does not refute the possibility of) an altered serotonergic responsivity following sleep deprivation, the suppressed prolactin response could reflect a downregulation of 5-HT1A or (2) receptors. An alternative, not mutually exclusive, explanation points to the possibility that sleep deprivation activates the tuburoinfundibular dopaminergic system, the final inhibitory pathway of prolactin regulation.
