Perim, R. R., et al. (2018). "Cross-talk inhibition between 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors in phrenic motor facilitation via NADPH oxidase and PKA." Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 314(5): R709-r715.

	Intermittent spinal serotonin receptor activation elicits phrenic motor facilitation (pMF), a form of spinal respiratory motor plasticity. Episodic activation of either serotonin type 2 (5-HT2) or type 7 (5-HT7) receptors elicits pMF, although they do so via distinct cellular mechanisms known as the Q (5-HT2) and S (5-HT7) pathways to pMF. When coactivated, these pathways interact via mutual cross-talk inhibition. Although we have a rudimentary understanding of mechanisms mediating cross-talk interactions between spinal 5-HT2 subtype A (5-HT2A) and 5-HT7 receptor activation, we do not know if similar interactions exist between 5-HT2 subtype B (5-HT2B) and 5-HT7 receptors. We confirmed that either spinal 5-HT2B or 5-HT7 receptor activation alone elicits pMF and tested the hypotheses that 1) concurrent activation of both receptors suppresses pMF due to cross-talk inhibition; 2) 5-HT7 receptor inhibition of 5-HT2B receptor-induced pMF requires protein kinase A (PKA) activity; and 3) 5-HT2B receptor inhibition of 5-HT7 receptor-induced pMF requires NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity. Selective 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptor agonists were administered intrathecally at C4 (3 injections, 5-min intervals) to anesthetized, paralyzed, and ventilated rats. Whereas integrated phrenic nerve burst amplitude increased after selective spinal 5-HT2B or 5-HT7 receptor activation alone (i.e., pMF), pMF was no longer observed with concurrent 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptor agonist administration. With concurrent receptor activation, pMF was rescued by inhibiting either NOX or PKA activity, demonstrating their roles in cross-talk inhibition between these pathways to pMF. This report demonstrates cross-talk inhibition between 5-HT2B- and 5-HT7 receptor-induced pMF and that NOX and PKA activity are necessary for that cross-talk inhibition.
