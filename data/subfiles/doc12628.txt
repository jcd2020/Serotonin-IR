	BACKGROUND: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first choice for the pharmacologic treatment of bulimia nervosa, but there are no published data on the putative altered serotonin (5-HT) receptor characteristics in patients with bulimia. Experimental studies suggest that the therapeutic antidepressant effect of SSRIs is mediated via 5-HT(1A) receptors. The aim of this study was to measure brain 5-HT(1A) receptor binding among nonmedicated patients with bulimia nervosa. METHODS: Positron emission tomography (PET) with a selective 5-HT(1A) ligand, [11C]WAY-100635, was performed on eight unmedicated patients with bulimia and 10 healthy comparison subjects. RESULTS: The binding potential values were greater in patients than in control subjects in all brain regions studied. The most robust differences were observed in the angular gyrus, the medial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that brain 5-HT(1A) receptor binding is increased in several cortical areas in patients with bulimia nervosa during their state of impulsive binge eating.
