	The intravenous administration of low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or of the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) depresses the firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT-containing neurons, presumably via the activation of 5-HT1A receptors. The present studies were undertaken to determine the effect of different types of 5-HT receptor antagonists on this effect of LSD and 8-OH-DPAT. (-)-Propranolol (2 mg/kg i.v.), methiothepin (2 mg/kg i.p., twice daily for 4 days followed by an additional dose of 2 mg/kg i.p., prior to the experiment), pelanserine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.), and indorenate (125 micrograms/kg i.v.) failed to block the effects of either LSD or 8-OH-DPAT on the firing activity of 5-HT neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus. However, spiperone (1 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced the effect of both LSD and 8-OH-DPAT. These results indicate that, among the five putative 5-HT receptor antagonists tested, only spiperone can antagonize the suppressant effect of 5-HT receptor agonists on the firing of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons.
