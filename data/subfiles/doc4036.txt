Gr√ºnder, G. (2010). "Cariprazine, an orally active D2/D3 receptor antagonist, for the potential treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar mania and depression." Curr Opin Investig Drugs 11(7): 823-832.

	Cariprazine (RGH-188), which is being codeveloped by Gedeon Richter Ltd, Forest Laboratories Inc and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp, is a novel putative antipsychotic drug that exerts partial agonism at dopamine D2/D3 receptors, with preferential binding to D3 receptors, and partial agonism at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. Its activity at D2/D3 receptors may be lower than that of the prototype partial agonist aripiprazole. The antipsychotic activity of cariprazine was demonstrated in animal models, and data also suggest that the propensity for extrapyramidal side effects is low and that the drug may have procognitive properties. Cariprazine is rapidly absorbed, with high oral bioavailability and a long plasma elimination t1/2. Cariprazine is in phase III clinical trials in patients with schizophrenia and in patients with bipolar disorder. Data from phase II trials in patients with schizophrenia and bipolar mania indicate that the drug has antipsychotic and antimanic properties that are superior to placebo. With its unique receptor affinity profile, cariprazine may represent a potential enrichment of the therapeutic armamentarium for schizophrenia and affective disorders. Its activity against the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia has to be carefully investigated.
