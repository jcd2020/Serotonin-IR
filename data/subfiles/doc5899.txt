KrebsThomson, K. and M. A. Geyer (1996). "The role of 5-HT1A receptors in the locomotor-suppressant effects of LSD: WAY-100635 studies of 8-OH-DPAT, DOI and LSD in rats." Behavioural Pharmacology 7(6): 551-559.

	The selective 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 was employed to further clarify the respective contributions of 5-HT1A receptors to the effects of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT, the 5-HT2 agonist DOI, and the mixed 5-HT1A/2 agonist LSD on exploratory locomotion in rats, In nocturnal studies of well-handled ruts during their first exposure to the Behavioral Pattern Monitor, which enables analyses of quantitative and qualitative changes in locomotor activity, locomotor and investigatory responses were reduced by treatment with either 8-OH-DPAT, DOI or LSD. The hypoactivity produced by 8-OH-DPAT, but not that produced by DOI, was antagonized by pretreatment with WAY-100635. These results substantiate the effectiveness and functional specificity of WAY-100635 as a 5-HT1A antagonist. Furthermore, these results are inconsistent with a functional interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors in the control of locomotor behavior. The decreases in locomotion produced by LSD were attenuated by pretreatment with WAY-100635, indicating that the effects of LSD in this paradigm are due partly to agonist actions at 5-HT1A receptors. Therefore, 5-HT1A receptors appear to play a direct role in mediating the effects of LSD on rodent locomotion.
