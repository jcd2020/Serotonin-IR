Poland, R. E. (1990). "Diminished corticotropin and enhanced prolactin responses to 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin in methylenedioxymethamphetamine pretreated rats." Neuropharmacology 29(11): 1099-1101.

	Although (+/-) methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has been reported to deplete serotonin (5-HT) and destroy 5-HT terminals in the brains of animals, the functional sequelae of such alterations remain to be established. In the present study, a blunted corticotropin and an enhanced prolactin response to the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH DPAT) was found in rats treated two weeks previously with a single dose of MDMA (2.0 or 20.0 mg/kg, sc). These results suggest that neurochemical changes produced by MDMA are associated with functional alterations as manifested by abnormal 5-HT receptor-coupled neuroendocrine responses.
