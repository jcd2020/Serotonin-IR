	Previous behavioral, neurochemical and neurophysiological experiments have shown that selective 5-HT2A and mixed D2/5-HT2A antagonists can attenuate some, but not all, responses to amphetamine. The generality of these findings were determined in the present experiment by assessing the effect of mixed D2/5-HT2A antagonists on cocaine-induced facilitation of ventral tegmental area self-stimulation in rats. Although amphetamine and cocaine influence activity in monoaminergic neurons through different mechanisms, our previous research has shown that selective D2 and 5-HT2A antagonists have similar effects on behavioral responses to these psychostimulants. Therefore, we expected a similar pattern of results using mixed D2/5-HT2A antagonists. As shown previously, cocaine decreased self-stimulation threshold in a dose-dependent manner. Haloperidol and the mixed D2/5-HT2A antagonists risperidone and MDL 28, 133A antagonized cocaine-induced facilitation of self-stimulation, but only at doses that increased baseline self-stimulation threshold. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.87, p < 0.001) between antagonist-induced change in baseline threshold and attenuation of cocaine's effect on threshold. Taken together, the results of this and previous experiments support the importance of D2 receptors in the mechanisms of brain stimulation reward. 5-HT2A receptors appear not to be involved in mediation of both brain stimulation reward and amphetamine- and cocaine-induced facilitation of brain stimulation reward.
