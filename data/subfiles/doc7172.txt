McBride, W. J. (2010). Role of Serotonin in Brain Reward and Regulation of Alcohol Drinking Behavior. Handbook of Behavioral Neurobiology of Serotonin. C. P. Muller and B. L. Jacobs. 21: 399-414.

	This chapter will review the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in mediating brain reward processes, and extend the review to the regulation of alcohol drinking by 5-HT. The first three sections of the chapter will focus on studies using intracranial self-stimulation, place conditioning, and conditioned reward and delay of reward procedures to examine the involvement of 5-HT in the regulation of brain reward systems. The fourth section will focus on studies of the involvement of 5-HT in regulating the rewarding properties of alcohol, as measured by alcohol drinking behavior of rodent models. Overall, the data suggest that 5-HT systems negatively modulate brain reward processes and alcohol drinking. However, some findings suggest that the effects of 5-HT on brain reward and alcohol drinking is dependent upon the subtype of 5-HT receptor.
