Akuzawa, S., et al. (1995). "CHARACTERIZATION OF H-3 YM060, A POTENT AND SELECTIVE 5-HT3 RECEPTOR RADIOLIGAND, IN THE CEREBRAL-CORTEX OF RATS." European Journal of Pharmacology 281(1): 37-42.

	The binding properties of a new radioligand, [methyl-H-3]-(-)-(R)-5-[(1-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)carbonyl]-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-benzimidazole monohydrochloride ([H-3]YM060), were studied in membranes of the rat cerebral cortex. [H-3]YM060 rapidly associated with its binding sites in membranes and reversibly dissociated. Saturation analysis revealed that the specific binding of [H-3]YM060 was saturable and non-specific binding was low. Scatchard analysis yielded a linear plot, suggesting a single population of binding sites with a dissociation constant (K-d) of 8.4 +/- 0.2 pM (n = 3) and the kinetic K-d determined from the association constant (K-+1) and the dissociation rate constant (K--1) was similar. The maximum number of binding sites (B-max) was 37.0 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg protein (n = 3). [H-3]YM060 binding was potently and stereospecifically inhibited by serotonin (5-HT)(3) receptor agonists and ant agonists. O ther 5-HT receptor ligands such as 8-OH-DPAT (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin), methysergide and ketanserin were inactive to inhibit specific binding at 10(-4) M. These results suggest that [H-3]YM060 is a highly potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor radioligand and will be useful in the further analysis of 5-HT3 receptors.
