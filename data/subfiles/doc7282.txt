	Dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the mediation of movement, cognition, and emotion (1, 2). Dopamine shortage plays a role in various neuropsychiatric disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), schizophrenia, autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and drug abuse. Two subtypes of dopamine receptors, D1 and D2/3, were well characterized pharmacologically and biochemically (3). D2/3 dopamine receptors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of PD, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease (HD), and schizophrenia (4). Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (5). It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (6, 7). Spiperone and its analog, 3-N-methylspiperone (NMSP), are high-affinity D2/3 dopamine and 5-HT2A serotonin receptor antagonists, showing a low affinity for alpha1-adrenergic receptors (8, 9). 3-N-[(11)C]Methylspiperone ([(11)C]NMSP) has been studied as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging D2/3 and 5HT2A receptor densities.
