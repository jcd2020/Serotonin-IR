	In the rat, intravenous (i.v.) serotonin (5-HT) is a noxious stimulus which produces distinct vagal afferent-mediated pseudoaffective responses, a passive avoidance behavior, a vagal afferent-mediated inhibition of the nociceptive tail-flick (TF) reflex and a complex triad of cardiovascular responses. In the present study, we have used a variety of 5-HT receptor antagonists to characterize the receptor subtype(s) in the rat that mediate (1) inhibition of the TF reflex and (2) the cardiovascular responses produced by i.v. 5-HT. 5-HT produced a dose-dependent (3-72 micrograms/kg, i.v.) inhibition of the TF reflex (ED50 = 15.3 +/- 0.7 micrograms/kg). Following administration of the 5-HT2 receptor-selective antagonists ketanserin (50-250 micrograms/kg, i.v.) or xylamidine (10-100 micrograms/kg, i.v.), or the 5-HT3 receptor-selective antagonists ICS 205-930 (50-250 micrograms/kg, i.v.) or MDL 72222 (25-250 micrograms/kg, i.v.), there appeared to be a parallel shift of the 5-HT dose-response curve to the right. Following co-administration of xylamidine (50 micrograms/kg, i.v.) with ICS 205-930 (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.), the 5-HT-induced inhibition of the TF reflex was completely abolished at all doses of 5-HT tested (3-288 micrograms/kg, i.v.). In contrast, administration of the centrally acting 5-HT2 receptor-selective antagonist LY 53857 (10-100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) or the non-specific receptor antagonist methysergide (25-500 micrograms/kg, i.v.) resulted in a dose-dependent, but not parallel shift of the 5-HT dose-response curve to the right. The maximal doses of LY 53857 and methysergide tested (250 micrograms/kg and 500 micrograms/kg, respectively) completely abolished the effects of 5-HT (3-288 micrograms/kg, i.v.). Administration of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin (25-100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) failed to alter the 5-HT dose-response curve, indicating that the effects of ketanserin were due to blockage of 5-HT2 receptors rather than alpha 1 receptors. Administration of each of the antagonists also produced marked, but selective effects on components of the complex cardiovascular response to i.v. 5-HT. Each of the 5-HT3 receptor selective antagonists (ICS 205-930 or MDL 72222) produced a dose-dependent attenuation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex-mediated hypotension and bradycardia, and each of the 5-HT2 receptor selective antagonists (xylamidine, ketanserin or LY 53857) produced a dose-dependent attenuation of the pressor response. The non-specific 5-HT receptor antagonist methysergide produced a dose-dependent attenuation of the 5-HT-induced pressor response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
