	Growing evidence suggests that a compromised serotonergic system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We assessed the expression of 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT6 receptors and cholinacetyltransferase (ChAT) activity in post-mortem frontal and temporal cortex from AD patients who had been prospectively assessed for cognitive function using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and behavioral changes using the Present Behavioral Examination (PBE). 5-HT1B/1D and 5-HT6 receptor densities were significantly reduced in both cortical areas. 5-HT1B/1D receptor, density was correlated to MMSE decline in the frontal cortex, supporting its implication in memory impairment. The best predictor for lowered 5-HT6 receptor density in the temporal cortex was the PBE measure of overactivity. The 5-HT6/ChAT ratio was related to aggression both in the frontal and temporal cortex. Therefore, antagonists acting at 5-HT6 receptors could be useful in the treatment of non-cognitive symptoms associated to AD.
