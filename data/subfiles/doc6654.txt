	In this study, we use in vivo microdialysis to investigate the influence of endogenous serotonin (5-HT) on striatal dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxyidoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) efflux in both basal and activated conditions. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram and fluoxetine were used to mobilize endogenous 5-HT. In halothane-anaesthetized rats, citalopram (5 mg/kg, i.p.), administered either alone or in combination with the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY 100635 (0.1 mg/kg, s.c.), while reducing striatal 5-HIAA outflow (-25 and -15%, respectively), had no effect on basal DA output. When locally applied into the striatum, citalopram had no effect at 1 microM concentration, but enhanced DA release after its perfusion at 25 and 100 mircroM concentrations (+27% and +67%, respectively). However, the injection of the neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine into the dorsal raphe nucleus, which markedly depleted 5-HT in the striatum, failed to modify the effect of 25 microM citalopram. In freely-moving rats, the intrastriatal infusion of citalopram or fluoxetine (1 microM each), had no effect on its own, but significantly enhanced the increase in DA outflow induced by the subcutaneous administration of 0.01 mg/kg haloperidol (+31% and +30% for citalopram and fluoxetine, respectively). These findings indicate that, in the striatum, endogenous 5-HT has no influence on DA release under basal conditions, but positively modulates DA outflow when nigro-striatal DA transmission is activated.
