Shimizu, S., et al. (2013). "5-HT1A agonist alleviates serotonergic potentiation of extrapyramidal disorders via postsynaptic mechanisms." Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 46: 86-91.

	We previously demonstrated that 5-HT stimulants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), potentiated antipsychotic-induced extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) by stimulating 5-HT2A/2C, 5-HT3 and 5-HT6 receptors. Here, we studied the effects of the 5-HT1A agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin ((+/-)-8-OH-DPAT) on the fluoxetine enhancement of EPS (i.e., bradykinesia and catalepsy) to determine if the 5-HT1A agonist can counteract the serotonergic potentiation of EPS. Fluoxetine did not induce EPS signs by itself, but significantly potentiated haloperidol-induced bradykinesia in mice. (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT (0.1-1mg/kg, i.p.) significantly attenuated the fluoxetine enhancement of haloperidol-induced bradykinesia in a dose-dependent manner. A selective 5-HT1A antagonist (s)-WAY-100135 completely reversed the anti-EPS action of (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT. Microinjection studies using rats revealed that local application of (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT into the dorsolateral striatum or the motor cortex significantly diminished fluoxetine-enhanced catalepsy. In contrast, (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT injected into the medial raphe nucleus failed to affect EPS induction. The present results illustrate that 5-HT1A agonist can alleviate the SSRI enhancement of EPS by activating postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in the striatum and cerebral cortex.
