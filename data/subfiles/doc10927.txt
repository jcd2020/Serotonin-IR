Roerig, B. and L. C. Katz (1997). "Modulation of intrinsic circuits by serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in developing ferret visual cortex." J Neurosci 17(21): 8324-8338.

	Serotonergic projections are widespread in the developing neocortex, but their functions are obscure. The effects of 5-HT3 receptor agonists on cortical circuit response properties were studied in slices of ferret primary visual cortex using high-speed optical imaging of voltage-sensitive dye signals and whole-cell patch-clamp recording. Activation of the 5-HT3 receptor decreased the amplitude and lateral extent of excitation throughout postnatal development. This effect peaks after eye opening, which indicates a function for serotonergic modulation of circuit responses during the period of refinement of cortical connections. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from single neurons revealed that synaptic responses evoked by white matter stimulation were reduced by 5-HT3 receptor agonists, whereas the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents was enhanced dramatically. This indicates that the modulation of spontaneous synaptic activity by fast-acting serotonin receptors is reflected in an inhibition of the circuit response, in line with the notion of background synaptic activity altering the spatiotemporal integration properties of cortical cells by changing their membrane potential and their electrotonic structure. These mechanisms may regulate the response properties of intrinsic circuits in both the adult and developing neocortex.
