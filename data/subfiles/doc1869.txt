Cheng, C. H., et al. (1994). "Actions of 5-hydroxytryptophan to inhibit and disinhibit mouse behaviour in the light/dark test." Eur J Pharmacol 255(1-3): 39-49.

	The involvement of 5-HT receptors in behavioural responding to an aversive situation was investigated in the mouse light/dark test. The administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) (12.5-50 mg/kg i.p.) increased brain 5-HT turnover and inhibited mouse behaviour in the light/dark test box. The 5-HT2C/5-HT2A receptor antagonists methysergide (1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg i.p.) and ritanserin (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.p.) antagonised (methysergide) or reversed (ritanserin) the effects of 5-HTP to an increased exploration of the light compartment; a low dose of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (0.01 mg/kg i.p.) had a similar effect. The disinhibitory effect of the 5-HTP/ritanserin interaction was antagonised by the 5-HT3/5-HT4 receptor antagonists SDZ205-557 (0.001-0.1 mg/kg) and a high dose of tropisetron (1.0 mg/kg i.p.) but not by ondansetron (1.0 mg/kg i.p.). At these doses tropisetron and ondansetron had no effect in their own right. Thus the dominant effect of 5-HTP in the mouse is to inhibit behaviour, a response mediated via 5-HT2C/5-HT2A and 5-HT3 receptors. A 5-HT4 receptor may effect an opposing disinhibitory potential as revealed by ritanserin.
