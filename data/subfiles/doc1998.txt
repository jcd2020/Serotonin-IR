	SR 57746A, 4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)-N-[2-(naphth-2-yl)ethyl]-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine HCl, was studied for its specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist action and antidepressant-like effects in the rat. The compound showed a high affinity for 5-HT1A specific binding sites in the rat hippocampus (IC50 3 nM), moderate affinity (10(-7)-10(-6) M) for dopamine D2 receptor, 5-HT uptake, 5-HT2 and alpha 1-adrenoceptor binding sites and practically no effect on binding sites of monoamine, GABAA, benzodiazepine and histamine receptors. It inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in rat hippocampal membranes at concentrations of 10(-6) and 10(-5) M. The effect of 10(-6) M SR 57746A on forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity was completely antagonized by 10(-6) M (-)-propranolol. Administered per os as a three-dose course to rats, SR 57746A significantly increased struggling in the forced swimming test at doses from 0.3 to 3 mg/kg. Single doses had no such effect. The effect of a three-dose course with 1 mg/kg SR 57746A on rats' struggling was antagonized by pretreatment with 5 mg/kg i.p. metergoline, a non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist, and by 20 mg/kg i.p. (-)-propranolol, an antagonist at 5-HT1 receptors. Three oral doses of 100 mg/kg parachlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of 5-HT synthesis, and 100 mg/kg i.p. (+/-)-sulpiride, an antagonist at dopamine D2 receptors, also antagonized the effect of SR 57746A in the forced swimming test. The results show that SR 57746A has selectivity and high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
