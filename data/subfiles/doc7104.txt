Laporte, A. M., et al. (1991). "3H 5-METHYL-URAPIDIL LABELS 5-HT1A RECEPTORS AND ALPHA-1-ADRENOCEPTORS IN THE RAT CNS - INVITRO BINDING AND AUTORADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES." Eur J Pharmacol 198(1): 59-67.

	The tritiated derivative of the potent antihypertensive agent, 5-methyl-urapidil, was used as a radioligand in binding studies with rat brain membranes and tissue sections. Serotonin and prazosin inhibited [H-3]5-methyl-urapidil binding to membranes from the rat hippocampus, cerebral cortex and brainstem biphasically, leading to the definition of serotonin high-affinity and prazosin high-affinity [H-3]5-methyl-urapidil binding sites. Comparison of these serotonin-sensitive [H-3]5-methyl-urapidil binding sites with the 5-HT1A sites labelled by [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT) revealed striking similarities regarding pharmacological properties, respective densities and regional distribution. On the other hand, the prazosin-sensitive [H-3]5-methyl-urapidil binding sites should correspond to the alpha-1A-subtype of adrenoceptors which has recently been defined. Detailed autoradiographic investigations allowed the detection of 5-HT1A sites labelled by both [H-3]5-methyl-urapidil and [H-3]8-OH-DPAT in the posterior raphe nuclei (pallidus and obscurus) which are possibly involved in the hypotensive action of 5-methyl-urapidil. These data demonstrate that [H-3]5-methyl-urapidil is a useful radioligand for the visualization and quantification of both 5-HT1A serotonin receptors and alpha-1A-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system.
