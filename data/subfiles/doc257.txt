Amano, T., et al. (2001). "Inhibitory effects of tandospirone, a 5-HT1A agonist, on medial vestibular nucleus neurons responding to lateral roll tilt stimulation in rats." Brain Res 910(1-2): 195-198.

	An electrophysiological study was performed using chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats to determine whether tandospirone, a 5-HT1A agonist, affects neuronal activities of the medial vestibular nucleus (MVN), since serotonergic innervation and 5-HT1A receptors are present in this nucleus. Tandospirone applied microiontophoretically at a current of 20-60 nA caused an inhibition of tilt-induced firing of alpha-type neurons, which showed increased and decreased firing with lateral tilt ipsilateral and contralateral to the recording site, respectively, along with that of beta-type neurons which exhibited the reverse responses to ipsilateral and contralateral tilt stimulation. The inhibition was antagonized during simultaneous, iontophoretic application of WAY-100635 (20-60 nA), a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, although WAY-100635 alone rarely affected spontaneous or tilt-induced firing in either type of neurons. These results suggest that tandospirone acts on a 5-HT1A receptor to inhibit transmission of otolith information to alpha- and beta-type MVN neurons.
