	The present study investigated the involvement of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the inhibitory effect of single administration of cocaine (COC, 15 mg/kg i.p.) on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in slices of rat dentate gyrus (DG), prepared 30 min and 2 days after COC administration. These effects of COC were blocked by an antagonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors, WAY 100635 (0.4 mg/kg i.p.), which had been administered 20 min before COC. The detrimental effect of COC on LTP in slices prepared 30 min after COC administration could be prevented by blocking glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) using mifepristone (RU 38486, 10 mg/kg s.c. given 1 h before COC), similar as in slices obtained 2 days after COC as reported previously [Mackowiak et al. (2008) Eur J Neurosci 27:2928-2937]. After a single administration of an agonist of 5-HT(1A) receptors, 8-OH-DPAT, (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), the level of LTP in slices prepared 2 days later was significantly decreased resembling the effect of COC. This effect of 8-OH-DPAT was antagonized by WAY 100635 (0.4 mg/kg i.p.), administered 20 min before 8-OH-DPAT and by RU 38486, given 1 h before 8-OH-DPAT. COC-induced inhibition of LTP could be blocked by the inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2), SL 327 (50 mg/kg i.p.), administered 1 h before COC, but not by the inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), LY 294002 (80 mg/kg i.p.). COC-induced reduction in the number of polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM)-positive neurons in rat dentate gyrus could also be prevented by WAY 100635, given 20 min before COC. These data indicate that the indirect 5-HT(1A) receptor activation by a single COC administration and subsequent stimulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK 1/2) signaling pathway result in a decrease of the potential for long-term increase in synaptic efficacy in rat DG lasting at least two but less than 7 days, most likely via activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.
