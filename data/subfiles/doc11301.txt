	The effect of the native and rodent-selective 5-HT1B receptor agonists (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and CP93,129) on the K+-evoked overflows of [3H]5-HT, [3H]dopamine (DA) and [3H]acetylcholine (ACh) was studied in synaptosome preparations obtained from rat brain striatum or hippocampus loaded with radiolabeled neurotransmitter. The aim of the study was to compare the different potencies of the specific 5-HT1B receptor agonists to stimulate the auto and heteroreceptors and to modulate the different neurotransmitter release. Results show that under the same experimental conditions, 5-HT and CP93,129 exhibited significantly higher potencies in inhibiting the K+-evoked overflow of [3H]5-HT from synaptosomes of rat striatum (IC50=2.0+/-1.8 nM and 20.5+/-3.1 nM, respectively) than in inhibiting the K+-evoked overflow of [3H]DA from synaptosomes of the same cerebral region (IC50= 0.8+/-0.2 microM and 1.8+/-0.4 microM, respectively), or [3H]ACh from synaptosomes of hippocampus (IC50=1.7+/-0.8 microM for CP93,129). The inhibitory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor agonists on [3H] K+-overflows were antagonized by the selective 5-HT1B receptor antagonist (SB224289), further indicating that the observed effects were 5-HT1B receptor specific. Sumatriptan, a selective r5-HT1D receptor agonist, did not show any significant effect on the K+-overflow of [3H]5-HT in the range of concentrations (10(-10) to 10(-6) M), and did not affect the K+ overflow of [3H]DA or [3H]ACh at concentrations (10(-9) to 10(-4) M), which exclude the involvement of 5-HT1D receptors. These inhibitory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor agonists were highly attenuated by pertussis toxin in the three systems studied, suggesting the involvement of Gi/Go-proteins in the transduction mechanism pathway of the receptor generated signal. In conclusion, these results suggest that 5-HT1B heteroreceptors located on dopaminergic and cholinergic terminals exhibit a lower sensitivity to 5-HT1B receptor agonist and antagonist than do 5-HT1B autoreceptors. The observed difference in functional sensitivities of 5-HT1B auto- and heteroreceptors may represent important consequences in the physiological control of the release of serotonin versus that of other neurotransmitters.
