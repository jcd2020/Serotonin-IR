Kamei, J., et al. (1991). "EFFECTS OF 8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN, A SELECTIVE AGONIST OF 5-HT1A RECEPTORS, ON THE COUGH REFLEX IN RATS." European Journal of Pharmacology 203(2): 253-258.

	The effects of the agonist of 5-HT1A receptors, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), on the capsaicin-induced cough reflex in rats were studied. I.p. injection of 8-OH-DPAT, at doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, significantly decreased the number of coughs in a dose-dependent manner. The antitussive effect of 8-OH-DPAT (0.3 mg/kg) was blocked by prior injection of methysergide (3 mg/kg i.p.) and spiperone (0.3 mg/kg i.p.), whereas ketanserin (3 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on the antitussive effect of 8-OH-DPAT. The antitussive effects of dihydrocodeine (1 mg/kg i.p.) and dextromethorphan (3 mg/kg i.p.) were also antagonized by methysergide and spiperone. However, these cough-depressant effects were not reduced by ketanserin. These results suggest that the antitussive action of 8-OH-DPAT may be related to the enhancement of the function of 5-HT1A receptors, and that antitussives interact with the 5-HT1A receptors.
