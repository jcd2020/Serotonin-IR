	The aim of the present study was to characterize in vivo the 5-HT receptor subtypes which mediate the effect of microiontophoretic applied 5-HT in the guinea pig head of caudate nucleus and orbitofrontal cortex. 5-HT and the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI and the preferential 5-HT2C receptor agonist mCPP, suppressed the quisqualate (QUIS)-induced activation of neurons in both structures. The inhibitory effect of DOI and mCPP was not prevented by acute intravenous administration of the 5-HT1/2 receptor antagonist metergoline (2 mg/kg) and the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist ritanserin (2 mg/kg) in the two regions nor by the selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL100907 (1 mg/kg) in the head of caudate nucleus. However, the inhibitory effect of DOI, but not that of mCPP, was antagonized by a 4-day treatment with metergoline and ritanserin (2 mg/kg/day; using minipumps implanted subcutaneously) in head of caudate nucleus, but not in orbitofrontal cortex. Microiontophoretic ejection of the 5-HT1A/7 receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT and of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 both suppressed the spontaneous and QUIS-activated firing activity of orbitofrontal cortex neurons. At currents which did not affect the basal discharge activity of the neuron recorded, microiontophoretic application of WAY100635 and BMY7378 failed to prevent the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT. The inhibitory effect of gepirone, which is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist but devoid of affinity for 5-HT7 receptors, was also not antagonized by WAY100635. Altogether, these results suggest the presence of atypical 5-HT1A receptors in the orbitofrontal cortex. The present results also indicate that the suppressant effect of DOI may be mediated by 5-HT2A receptors in head of caudate nucleus and atypical 5-HT2 receptors in orbitofrontal cortex.
