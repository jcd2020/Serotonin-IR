Wieland, S. and I. Lucki (1991). "ALTERED BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES MEDIATED BY SEROTONIN RECEPTORS IN THE GENETICALLY DYSTONIC (DT) RAT." Brain Research Bulletin 26(1): 11-16.

	The genetically dystonic (dt) rat is an animal model of dystonia that displays sustained abnormal movements that include: torticollis, clasping of the hindlimbs, rigidity of the limbs, and contortions of the trunk. Since serotonin (5-HT) has been shown to be involved in some animal models of movement disorders, the functional responsivness of the 5-HT system in dt rats and phenotypical normal littermates was examined by administering 5-HT agonists selective for different receptor subtypes and observing behavioral responses associated with the activation of specific 5-HT receptor subtypes. The dt rats were 6-fold more sensitive to the ability of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) to produce the 5-HT behavioral syndrome. The dt rats demonstrated a diminished head-shaking response following administration of the 5-HT2 agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOB). However, the dt rats also displayed significantly fewer head shakes following mechanical stimulation of the aural pinnae. The inability of the dt rat to demonstrate head-shaking behavior following stimulation of 5-HT2 receptors is probably due to the dt rat's difficulty in producing the motor responses involved in this behavioral response and do not reflect alterations in 5-HT2 receptor sensitivity. These results suggest the 5-HT system, particularly 5-HT1A receptors, may have an integral role in the abnormal movements displayed by the genetically dystonic rat and movement disorders in general.
