Vandermeerschmougeot, V., et al. (1993). "BENZODIAZEPINES REVERSE THE ANTI-IMMOBILITY EFFECT OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS IN THE FORCED SWIMMING TEST IN MICE." Neuropharmacology 32(5): 439-446.

	The present study provides evidence that, in mice subjected to the forced swimming test, the anti-immobility effect of the tricyclic antidepressants, desipramine and imipramine (16-32 mg/kg) was antagonized by the acute co-administration of a benzodiazepine, diazepam (0.25-2 mg/kg) and lorazepam (0.125 mg/kg). This effect cannot be accounted for by variations in plasma and/or brain levels of each compound since brain and plasma concentrations of desipramine and plasma levels of diazepam and desmethyldiazepam, measured immediately after the swimming test, were not significantly modified by the co-administration. Diazepam (2 mg/kg) also counteracted the reduction of time spent immobile induced by the MAO inhibitors, toloxatone (256 mg/kg) and selegiline (4 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg), but not by the psychostimulant, caffeine (32 mg/kg). The sedative neuroleptic, thioridazine (4 mg/kg) was also found to reverse the anti-immobility effect of desipramine whereas the non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics, alpidem (8 mg/kg) and buspirone (0.5 mg/kg) did not. These results indicate that the observed interactions were unlikely to be accounted for by a reduction of the stressful aspect of the situation whereas the participation of some motor or sedative component could not be totally ruled out.
