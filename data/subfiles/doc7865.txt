Makarenko, I. G., et al. (2002). "Distribution of serotonin 5-hydroxytriptamine 1B (5-HT(1B)) receptors in the normal rat hypothalamus." Neurosci Lett 328(2): 155-159.

	This is the study first attempting to evaluate distribution of neurons expressing serotonin 5-hydroxytriptamine 1B (5-HT(1B)) receptors in hypothalamus by using immunocytochemistry. The 5-HT(1B)-immunoreactive neurons were widely distributed in hypothalamus. Accumulations of 5-HT(1B) neurons occurred in magnocellular nuclei, supraoptic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus (dorsolateral part) and accessory perifornical, circular and retrochiasmatic nuclei. Magnocellular neurons manifested an intense immunostaining suggesting a high level of 5-HT(1B) receptors. Large and middle-sized neurons with different 5-HT(1B) staining patterns were scattered throughout lateral hypothalamus, periventricular nucleus and lateral preoptic area. Immunofluorescent double-labeling revealed a great overlapping of the distribution 5-HT(1B) neurons and dense network of neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive fibers in paraventricular, supraoptic and arcuate nuclei. The potential functional significance of 5-HT(1B) receptors in the 5-HT control of endocrine functions and feeding are discussed.
