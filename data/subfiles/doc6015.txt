	The present study on rat examined the role of galanin receptor subtypes in regulation of depression-like behavior as well as potential molecular mechanisms involved in the locus coeruleus (LC) and dorsal raphe (DR). The effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of galanin or galanin receptor GalR1- and GalR2-selective ligands was studied in the forced swim test, followed by quantitative in situ hybridization studies. Naive control, non-treated (swim control), saline-and fluoxetine-treated rats were used as controls in the behavioral and in situ hybridization studies. Subchronic treatment with fluoxetine reduced immobility and climbing time. Intracerebroventricular infusion of galanin, the GalR1 agonist M617 or the GalR2 antagonist M871 increased, while the GalR2(R3) agonist AR-M1896 decreased, immobility time compared to the aCSF-treated animals. Galanin also decreased the time of climbing. Galanin mRNA levels were upregulated by the combination of injection + swim stress in the saline-and the fluoxetine-treated groups in the LC, but not in the DR. Also tyrosine hydroxylase levels in the LC were increased following injection + swim stress in the saline-and fluoxetine-treated rats. Tryptophan hydroxylase 2 and serotonin transporter mRNAs were not significantly affected by any treatment. 5-HT1A mRNA levels were downregulated following i.c.v. galanin, M617 or AR-M1896 infusion. These results indicate a differential role of galanin receptor subtypes in depression-like behavior in rodents: GalR1 subtype may mediate 'prodepressive' and GalR2 'antidepressant' effects of galanin. Galanin has a role in behavioral adaptation to stressful events involving changes of molecules important for noradrenaline and/or serotonin transmission.
