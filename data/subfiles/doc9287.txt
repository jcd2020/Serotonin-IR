	Atopic eczema symptoms may worsen due to stress. In the present study, the cerebellar cortex of the atopic-like mouse NC/Nga was studied regarding the effect of chronic mild stress on expression of two well-characterized serotonergic receptors (R), 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A. In total 24 mice were used. Sixteen of these mice were subjected to unpredictable stressors for 12 weeks, and 8 mice were used as controls. In order to evoke an eczema, a mite antigen was applied to 16 mice from week 9 of the experiment. Thus, three groups of mice, stressed eczematous (SE), non-stressed eczematous (NSE) and stressed control (SC), respectively, were obtained. The expression of the 5-HT1AR was analyzed using quantitative immunohistochemistry. For evaluation of 5-HT2AR a semi-quantitative technique was used, the cell density and signal intensity being measured. The highest average value for 5-HT1AR expression, in the Purkinje cells, was recorded in the NSE group, while the lowest average was in the SC group. 5-HT1AR expression differed significantly between the groups. The highest average value for density of 5-HT2AR positive Purkinje cells was evident in the SE group, while the lowest was in the SC group, this difference between groups also being statistically significant. In addition, the signal intensity was highest in the SE group, with a difference compared to the other groups. In conclusion, chronic mild stress modulates serotonergic receptor expressions in the cerebellar cortex of atopic-like mice.
