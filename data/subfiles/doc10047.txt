Peremans, K., et al. (2003). "Regional binding index of the radiolabeled selective 5-HT2A antagonist 123I-5-I-R91150 in the normal canine brain imaged with single photon emission computed tomography." Vet Radiol Ultrasound 44(3): 344-351.

	The pattern of the specific 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor) antagonist 123I-5-I-R91150 was measured in 10 healthy dogs without neurologic and behavior abnormalities. Eight cortical regions (left and right fronto-, temporo-, parieto-, and occipitocortical area), one global subcortical region (including the thalamic system) were compared with a reference region lacking receptors; that is, the cerebellum. The 123I labeled radioligand was injected intravenously 100-200 minutes before acquisition. Both transmission and emission data were obtained with a triple head gamma camera equipped with high-resolution fanbeam collimators. The emission data were corrected for scatter and attenuation. To delineate different cerebral regions more accurately, the regions of interest (ROI) defined in a former study on brain perfusion measured with 99mTc-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) in the same dogs were used. The co-registration of the 99mTc-ECD and the 123I-5-I-R91150, obtained from each dog, was realized with the help of corresponding transmission maps. By normalizing each regional cerebral activity to the activity observed in the cerebellum, the regional radioactivity (binding index) could be relatively quantified. Highest brain uptake was noted in the frontocortical brain areas (right: 1.85, left: 1.89), followed by the temporocortical region (right: 1.58, left: 1.56). Least uptake was noted in the more caudal and middle brain regions [occipito- (right: 1.46, left: 1.41), parietocortical (right: 1.30, left: 1.26), and striatal region (1.19)]. No gender nor age influence was noted in this series. The 123I labeled serotonin-2A receptor ligand seems to have similar cortical binding in the normal canine brain, as shown in humans and other animal species. A frontocortical to occipitocortical (rostrocaudal) binding index gradient was identified within the dog, which has not been seen in imaging studies from humans and other animal species. The significance of these results will need further investigation. This normative data can be used to compare regional brain uptake of the 123I-radioligand to dogs with behavioral disorders related to the serotonergic system, in future studies.
