"SEROTONIN-STIMULATED RELEASE OF H-3 DOPAMINE VIA REVERSAL OF THE DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER IN RAT STRIATUM AND NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS - A COMPARISON WITH RELEASE ELICITED BY POTASSIUM, N-METHYL-D-ASPARTIC ACID, GLUTAMIC-ACID AND D-AMPHETAMINE." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 262(1): 356-364.

	Release of preloaded radiolabeled dopamine ([H-3]DA) elicited by several agents from terminal fields of mesolimbic and nigrostriatal projections in rats was compared. Several similarities between the two areas were observed. For example, potassium, which stimulates release both directly, through altering the potential across the membrane of the dopaminergic neuron, as well as indirectly, presumably by releasing endogenous excitatory neurotransmitters, exhibited some similarities to release stimulated by L-glutamate and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. These included sensitivity to tetrodotoxin (TTX), Mg++ and Ca++. In contrast, release of [H-3]DA stimulated by serotonin (5-HT), like that stimulated by D-amphetamine, depended upon a functional dopamine transport system and was less sensitive to TTX, Mg++ and Ca++. 5-HT-stimulated [H-3]DA release in striatum (STR) and nucleus accumbens (NACC) was not modified by antagonists at 5-HT2 or 5-HT3 receptors. Differences were observed in release of [H-3]DA from STR and NACC. Elevated potassium (20 mM) released about twice as much [H-3]DA from NACC as it did from STR. 5-HT was also able to release more [H-3]DA from NACC than from STR. Conversely, D-amphetamine released more [H-3]DA from STR than from NACC. TTX increased release stimulated by potassium in STR, but decreased release stimulated by potassium in NACC. These observations suggest that receptor- and non-receptor-mediated mechanisms may contribute to regulation of [H-3]DA release in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal areas of the brain. It is possible that endogenous 5-HT in STR or NACC acts as a local regulator of DA release acting via a transport-dependent mechanism. The relative innervation by glutamatergic and serotonergic pathways, as well as local contributions by interneurons, may explain the differing sensitivities of each brain region to TTX and ionic manipulation.
