Hemrick-Luecke, S. K. and R. W. Fuller (1995). "Decreased hypothalamic epinephrine concentration by quipazine and other serotonin agonists in rats." Biochem Pharmacol 49(3): 323-327.

	Epinephrine concentrations in rat hypothalamus were decreased after the injection of quipazine, a direct-acting serotonin (5-HT) agonist. The decrease was statistically significant and dose-dependent from 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, s.c., was apparent within 1 hr, and persisted for 8 hr but not 24 hr. There was no decrease in epinephrine concentrations in rat medulla oblongata, a region containing epinephrine cell bodies. Epinephrine concentrations in rat hypothalamus were also decreased by 1-(m-trifluoromethylphenyl)-piperazine (TFMPP) and by 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), other direct-acting 5-HT agonists, and by d-fenfluramine, a 5-HT-releasing drug. The decrease evoked by quipazine was prevented by pretreatment with metergoline, ketanserin or LY53857 (6-methyl-1-[methylethyl]-ergoline-8-carboxylic acid 2-hydroxy-1-methyl-propyl ester), centrally acting 5-HT antagonists. The lowering of rat hypothalamic epinephrine concentrations by 8-OH-DPAT was prevented by pretreatment with pindolol, a centrally acting 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. These data suggest that serotonergic drugs affect epinephrine concentrations in rat hypothalamus.
