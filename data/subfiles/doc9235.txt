	Bacopa monniera is a well-known medhya-rasayana (memory enhancing and rejuvenating) plant in Indian traditional medical system of Ayurveda. The effect of a standardized extract of Bacopa monniera (BESEB CDRI-08) on serotonergic receptors and its influence on other neurotransmitters during hippocampal-dependent learning was evaluated in the present study. Wistar rat pups received a single dose of BESEB CDRI-08 during postnatal days 15-29 showed higher latency during hippocampal-dependent learning accompanied with enhanced 5HT(3A) receptor expression, serotonin and acetylcholine levels in hippocampus. Furthermore, 5HT(3A) receptor agonist 1-(m-chlorophenyl)-biguanide (mCPBG) impaired learning in the passive avoidance task followed by reduction of 5HT(3A) receptor expression, 5HT and ACh levels. Administration of BESEB CDRI-08 along with mCPBG attenuated mCPBG induced behavioral, molecular and neurochemical alterations. Our results suggest that BESEB CDRI-08 possibly acts on serotonergic system, which in turn influences the cholinergic system through 5-HT(3) receptor to improve the hippocampal-dependent task.
