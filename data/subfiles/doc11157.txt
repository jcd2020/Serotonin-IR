Trillat, A. C., et al. (1998). "[Homozygote mice deficient in serotonin 5-HT1B receptor and antidepressant effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]." C R Seances Soc Biol Fil 192(6): 1139-1147.

	We use the knockout mice strategy to investigate the contribution of the 5-HT1B receptor in mediating the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Using microdialysis in awake 129/Sv mice, we show that the absence of the 5-HT1B receptor in mutant mice (KO 1B -/-) potentiated the effect of paroxetine on extracellular 5-HT levels in the ventral hippocampus, but not in the frontal cortex compared to wild-type mice (WT). Furthermore, using the forced swimming test, we demonstrate that SSRIs decreased immobility of WT mice, and this effect is absent in KO 1B -/- mice showing therefore that activation of 5-HT1B receptors mediate the antidepressant-like effects of SSRIs. Taken together these findings suggest that 5-HT1B autoreceptors limit the effects of SSRI particularly in the hippocampus while postsynaptic 5-HT1B receptors are required for the antidepressant activity of SSRIs.
