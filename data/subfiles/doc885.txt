	Signaling through serotonin 5-HT1A receptors involves multiple pathways. We have investigated the functional coupling of the human 5-HT1A receptor to different G proteins using an in vitro reconstitution system based on the expression of recombinant receptor (r5-HT1A) and G-alpha-subunits (rG(alpha)) in Escherichia coli. The r5-HT1A receptor was expressed by insertion in a vector allowing its active expression in E. coli inner membranes. Binding of the selective agonist [H-3] +/- 8-hydroxy-(2-N-dipropylamine)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT) to intact bacteria or E. coli membranes was saturable with a K(D) of approximately 8 nM and an average of 120 sites/bacterium. Binding properties of several serotoninergic ligands to r5-HT1A receptors were comparable with those measured in mammalian cells. Incubation of rG(alpha) . beta-gamma with E. coli membranes resulted in high affinity agonist [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding (K(D) = 0. 7 nM) and titration with a panel of rG(alpha) subtypes showed the order of potency: rG(i-alpha-3) > rG(i-alpha-2) > rG(i-alpha-1) >> rG(o-alpha), while rG(s-alpha) appeared incapable of interacting with 5-HT1A receptors. Moreover, agonist-mediated enhancement of [S-35]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding to rG(i-alpha) confirmed the achievement of the functional interaction between receptor and G proteins. Our findings are in agreement with the in vivo ability of 5-HT1A receptors to activate G(i-alpha) related to adenylyl cyclase inhibition or K+ channel activation, but do not support previously reported adenylyl cyclase stimulation through interaction with G(s-alpha).
