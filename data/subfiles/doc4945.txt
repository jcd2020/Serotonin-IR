Ichikawa, J., et al. (2002). "5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors minimally contribute to clozapine-induced acetylcholine release in rat medial prefrontal cortex." Brain Res 939(1-2): 34-42.

	The atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone, and ziprasidone preferentially increase dopamine (DA) release in rat medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). These effects have been shown to depend upon potent 5-HT(2A) relative to weak D(2) antagonism, and 5-HT(1A) agonism as well. Atypical APDs also increase acetylcholine (ACh) release in the mPFC, but not the nucleus accumbens (NAC) or striatum (STR), whereas typical APDs such as haloperidol, S(-)-sulpiride and thioridazine do not produce either effect in the mPFC. This study examined the role of 5-HT(1A) agonism, 5-HT(2A) and D(2) antagonism, and the combination thereof, in the ability of clozapine to increase ACh release in rat mPFC. R(+)-8-OH-DPAT (0.2 mg/kg), a 5-HT(1A) agonist, WAY100635 (0.2-0.5 mg/kg), a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, and DOI (0.6-2.5 mg/kg), a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, increased ACh release in the mPFC, whereas M100907 (0.03-1 mg/kg), a 5-HT(2A) antagonist, did not. DOI (2.5 mg/kg) and M100907 (0.1 mg/kg) had no effect on ACh release in the NAC or STR. WAY100635 and M100907 inhibited the ability of R(+)-8-OH-DPAT and DOI, respectively, to increase ACh release in the mPFC. WAY100635, which inhibits clozapine-induced DA release in the mPFC, failed to inhibit clozapine (20 mg/kg)-induced ACh release in that region. Similarly, the combination of M100907 and haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg), which enhances DA release in the mPFC, failed to increase ACh release in that region. These results suggest that 5-HT(1A) agonism and 5-HT(2A) antagonism, as well as DA release, contribute minimally to the ability of clozapine, and perhaps other atypical APDs, to increase ACh release in the mPFC.
