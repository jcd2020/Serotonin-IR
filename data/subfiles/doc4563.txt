Herth, M. M. and G. M. Knudsen (2018). PET Imaging of the 5-HT2A Receptor System: A Tool to Study the Receptor's In Vivo Brain Function. 5-Ht2a Receptors in the Central Nervous System. B. P. Guiard and G. DiGiovanni. 32: 86-135.

	The serotonergic 5-HT2A receptor system plays a key modulatory role for many brain functions such as regulation of mood, temperature, sex, appetite and emotions. The receptor is also involved in a number of brain disorders, for example, depression, Alzheimer's disease or schizophrenia. This makes it an obvious target for many drugs. This chapter describes how the in vivo imaging technique positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to investigate 5-HT2A receptors in humans in terms of neurobiology and brain disorders. It also highlights how PET can be used in drug development and in humans in terms of neurobiology and brain disorders. It also highlights how PET can be used in drug development and explains the basic methodology of PET. The chapter discusses currently used 5-HT2A receptor selective PET tracers. This chapter explains with the help of 5-HT2A receptor tracers how PET can be used in vivo to determine a drug's receptor occupancy. Finally, the possibility of 5-HT2A receptor selective PET tracers imaging endogenous serotonin levels in the living brain is discussed.
