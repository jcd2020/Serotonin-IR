	Previous behavioural studies have shown that 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists either block or have no effect on amphetamine-induced effects. The present experiments investigated whether or not the highly selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron would affect the anorectic effect of a small dose (1 mg/kg) of d-amphetamine. Nondeprived male rats were tested in two feeding paradigms: consumption of a palatable sweetened mash and ingestion of a 3% sucrose solution. Ondansetron (10-100 mug/kg) did not antagonize amphetamine-induced anorexia; instead, in both paradigms consumption was reduced still further when the 5-HT3 antagonist was given in conjunction with amphetamine. Ondansetron given alone had significant effects on consumption, but the direction of the effect differed according to the paradigm. Sweetened mash intake was significantly increased at 30 and 100 mug/kg, while sucrose ingestion was significantly reduced at 10 and 30 mug/kg ondansetron. ft is suggested that ondansetron has two opposing effects on intake, one of which (hyperphagia) can be masked by d-amphetamine, leaving an anorectic effect that augments that of d-amphetamine.
