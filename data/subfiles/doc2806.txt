	Serotonin (5-HT) is involved in neuroimmunomodulation. We analyzed the effects of sumatriptan, a 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, and ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, on thalamic mast cell (TMC) population, the only immunocytes known to infiltrate the brain in physiological conditions. Only sumatriptan was effective, significantly increasing TMC numbers versus controls, and especially those containing 5-HT. 5-HT1B receptors are concentrated in the median eminence on non-serotonergic axonal endings, probably hypothalamic terminal fibers, involved in hypothalamic-pituitary neuroendocrine modulating processes. TMC variations could reflect serotonergic actions on these fibers. TMCs would thus be cellular interfaces mediating immune action in the nervous system in relation with the hormonal status of the organism. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
