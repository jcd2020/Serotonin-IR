Decker, M., et al. (2004). "Dopamine/serotonin receptor ligands. Part VIII: the dopamine receptor antagonist LE300 - modelled and X-ray structure plus further pharmacological characterization, including serotonin receptor binding, biogenic amine transporter testing and in vivo testings." Eur J Med Chem 39(6): 481-489.

	-LE300, a benz[d]indolo[2,3-g]azecine with nanomolar affinities to the hD(1) receptor family, has been further pharmacologically characterized and its modelled structure was compared to its X-ray structure in order to explain NMR data, that was not in accordance to the X-ray structure. Moderate affinity at the hD(3) receptor was determined, nanomolar affinities were found at the 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors, micromolar affinity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor using binding assays. Functional studies indicate moderate antagonist activity at the 5-HT(2A) site. No activity was found at dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. These results suggested the use of LE300 for cocaine addiction treatment. High activities were found using in vivo testing: LE300 suppressed spontaneous locomotor activity with an ID(50) of 1.24 mg/kg and attenuated locomotor activity induced by 20 mg/kg cocaine with an AD(50) of 1.50 mg/kg. It failed to substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects produced by cocaine.
