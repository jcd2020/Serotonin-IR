Franklin, M. (2003). "Sub-chronic treatment effects of an extract of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort, Li 160) on neuroendocrine responses to the 5-T-2A agonist, DOI in the rat." Pharmacopsychiatry 36(4): 161-164.

	Clinical studies have demonstrated the antidepressant efficacy of LI 160 extracts, which is comparable to antidepressants such as imipramine. The study was undertaken to assess the sub-chronic effects of LI 160 extract on plasma corticosterone and prolactin (PRL) responses to the post-synaptic 5-HT2A receptor agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane (DOI), in the male rat. Results show that sub-chronic treatment with the LI 160 extract reduced corticosterone and PRL responses to DOI. LI 160 may modify brain 5-HT function in the rat, possibly by reducing the sensitivity of central 5-HT2A receptors. This may be a result of decreased receptor expression, signal transduction or intracellular messengers. These findings could be relevant to the therapeutic efficacy of St. John's wort.
