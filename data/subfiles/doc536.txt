Audinot, V., et al. (1998). "A comparative in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of the novel dopamine D-3 receptor antagonists (+)-S 14297, nafadotride, GR 103,691 and U 99194." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 287(1): 187-197.

	The benzofurane (+)-S 14297, the benzamide nafadotride, the aminoindane U 99194 and the arylpiperazine GR 103,691 have been proposed as "selective" antagonists at dopamine D-3 vs. D-2 receptors. Herein, we compared their in vitro affinities and in vivo actions to those of the aminotetralin D-3 antagonists (+)-AJ 76 and (+)-UH 232. Affinities at recombinant, human (h)D-3 and/or hD(2) sites were determined by employing the mixed D-2/D-3 antagonist [I-125]-iodosulpride and the preferential D-3 ligands [H-3]-(+)-PD 128,907 and [H-3]-(+)-S 14297. [H-3]-(+)-PD 128,907, [H-3]-(+)-S 14297 and [I-125]-iodosulpride yielded an essentially identical pattern of displacement at D-3 sites, which suggests that they recognize the same population of receptors. The rank order of potency (K-i values in nM vs. [H-3]-(+)-PD 128,907) was GR 103,691 (0.4) approximate to nafadotride (0.5)> haloperidol (2) approximate to (+)-UH 232 (3) approximate to (+)-S 14297 (5)>(+)-AJ 76 (26) > U 99194 (160). The rank order of preference (K-i ratio, D-2:D-3) for D-3 receptors (labeled by [H-3]-PD 128,907) vs. D-2 sites (labeled by [I-125]-iodosulpride) was (+)-S 14297 (61) approximate to GR 103,691 (60) > U 99194 (14) > nafadotride (9) approximate to (+)-UH 232 (8) - (+)-AJ 76 (6) > haloperidol (0.2). (+)-S 14297 and GR 103,691 also showed greater than 100-fold selectivity at dopamine hD(3) vs. hD(4) and hD(1) sites. However, GR 103,691 showed marked affinity for serotonin(1A) receptors (5.8 nM) and alpha-1 adrenoceptors (12.6 nM). In vivo, all antagonists except GR 103,691 prevented the induction of hypothermia by (+)-PD 128,907 (0.63 mg/kg s.c.) and a further preferential D-3 agonist, (+)-7-OH-DPAT (0.16 mg/kg s.c.). On the other hand, haloperidol, (+)-AJ 76, (+)-UH 232 and nafadotride all induced catalepsy in rats, whereas (+)-S 14297, U 99194 and GR 103,691 were inactive. Haloperidol, (+)-AJ 76, (+)-UH 232, nafadotride and (weakly) U 99194 also enhanced prolactin secretion and striatal dopamine synthesis, whereas (+)-S 14297 and GR 103,691 were inactive. However, despite its high affinity at 5-HT1A receptors and alpha-1 adrenoceptors, both of which are present on raphe-localized serotonergic neurons, GR 103,691 (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) failed to influence their basal firing rate or the inhibition of their electrical activity by the 5-HT1A agonist (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT(0.005 mg/kg i.v.), a result that casts doubt on its activity in vivo. In conclusion, both (+)-S 14297 and GR 103,691 are markedly selective ligands that permit the characterization of actions at hD(3) vs. hD(2) receptors in vitro, but (+)-S 14297 appears to be of greater utility for the evaluation of their functional significance in vivo. Nevertheless, to develop a better understanding of the respective roles of dopamine D-3 and D-2 receptors, we need additional, chemically diverse antagonists of improved potency and selectivity.
