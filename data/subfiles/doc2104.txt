Chen, A., et al. (2012). "Effects of prenatal stress and monoaminergic perturbations on the expression of serotonin 5-HT(4) and adrenergic beta(2) receptors in the embryonic mouse telencephalon." Brain Res 1459: 27-34.

	The serotonin 5-HT(4) receptor (5-HT(4)R) is coded by a complex gene that produces four mRNA splice variants in mice (5-HT(4(a))R, 5-HT(4(b))R, 5-HT(4(e))R, 5-HT(4(f))R). This receptor has highly dynamic expression in brain development and its splice variants differ in their developmental trajectories. Since 5-HT(4)Rs are important in forebrain function (including forebrain control of serotonergic activity in the brainstem), we investigated the susceptibility of 5-HT(4)R expression in the mouse embryonic telencephalon to prenatal maternal stress and altered serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) levels. Because the gene coding the adrenergic beta(2) receptor (beta(2)AR) is embedded in the 5-HT(4)R gene, we also investigated whether 5-HT(4)R mRNA levels were modulated by selective beta(2)AR agents. Timed-pregnant C57BL/6 mice were treated beginning at embryonic day (E) 14 and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to assess the mRNA levels of all 5-HT(4)R splice variants and beta(2)AR in the embryonic telencephalon at E17. Maternal prenatal stress and 5-HT depletion with pCPA, a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, reduced the levels of the 5-HT(4(b))R splice variant. Terbutaline (a selective beta(2)AR agonist) and ICI 118,551 (a selective beta(2)AR antagonist) had no effect on beta(2)AR and 5-HT(4)R mRNA levels. These results show that prenatal stress and reduced 5-HT levels can alter 5-HT(4)R expression in the developing forebrain and that some 5-HT(4)R splice variants may be more susceptible than others.
