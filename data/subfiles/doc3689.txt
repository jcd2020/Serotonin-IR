	Brain serotonin (5-HT) modulates the neural effects of ethanol. In the present study, we investigated the changes in 5-HT level, 5-HT2A receptor binding and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in brain stem and liver of ethanol treated rats and 5-HT2A regulation on ALDH in hepatocyte cultures in vitro. The 5-HT content in the brain stem and liver significantly decreased with an increased 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in the ethanol treated rats compared to control. Scatchard analysis of [H-3] (+/-)2,3-dimethoxyphenyl-1-[2-(-4-piperidine)-methanol] [H-3] MDL 100907 against ketanserin in brain stem of ethanol treated rats showed a significant increase in B (max) without any change in K (d) compared to control. The competition curve for [H-3] MDL 100907 against ketanserin fitted one-site model in both control and ethanol treated rats with unity as Hill slope value. A significant increase in V (max) of ALDH activity in liver and a significant decrease in K (m) in liver and brain stem of ethanol treated rats compared to control was observed. In 24 h culture studies, an increase in enzyme activity was observed in cells in medium with 10% ethanol. The elevated ALDH activity in ethanol treated cells was reversed to control level in presence of 10(-5) and 10(-7) M 5-HT. Ketanserin, an antagonist of 5-HT2A, reversed the effect of 5HT on 10% ethanol induced ALDH activity in hepatocytes. Our results showed that there was a decreased 5-HT content with an enhanced 5-HT2A receptor and aldehyde dehydrogenase activity in the brain stem of alcohol treated rats and in vitro hepatocyte cultures. The enhanced ALDH activity in ethanol supplemented hepatocytes was reversed to control level in presence of 10(-5) and 10(-7) M 5-HT.
