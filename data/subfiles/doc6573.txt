Kiss, B., et al. (2010). "Cariprazine (RGH-188), a Dopamine D-3 Receptor-Preferring, D-3/D-2 Dopamine Receptor Antagonist-Partial Agonist Antipsychotic Candidate: In Vitro and Neurochemical Profile." Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics 333(1): 328-340.

	Cariprazine {RGH-188; trans-N-[4-[2-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]cyclohexyl]-N',N'-dimethylurea hydrochloride}, a novel candidate antipsychotic, demonstrated approximately 10-fold higher affinity for human D-3 versus human D-2L and human D-2S receptors (pKi 10.07, 9.16, and 9.31, respectively). It displayed high affinity at human serotonin (5-HT) type 2B receptors (pK(i) 9.24) with pure antagonism. Cariprazine had lower affinity at human and rat hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors (pK(i) 8.59 and 8.34, respectively) and demonstrated low intrinsic efficacy. Cariprazine displayed low affinity at human 5-HT2A receptors (pK(i) 7.73). Moderate or low affinity for histamine H-1 and 5-HT2C receptors (pK(i) 7.63 and 6.87, respectively) suggest cariprazine's reduced propensity for adverse events related to these receptors. Cariprazine demonstrated different functional profiles at dopamine receptors depending on the assay system. It displayed D-2 and D-3 antagonism in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays, but stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) production (pEC(50) 8.50, E-max 30%) and antagonized (+/-)-quinpirole-induced IP accumulation (pK(b) 9.22) in murine cells expressing human D-2L receptors. It had partial agonist activity (pEC(50) 8.58, E-max 71%) by inhibiting cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human D-3 receptors and potently antagonized R(+)-2-dipropylamino-7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphtalene HBr (7-OH-DPAT)-induced suppression of cAMP formation (pK(b) 9.57). In these functional assays, cariprazine showed similar (D-2) or higher (D-3) antagonist-partial agonist affinity and greater (3-to 10-fold) D-3 versus D-2 selectivity compared with aripiprazole. In in vivo turnover and biosynthesis experiments, cariprazine demonstrated D-2-related partial agonist and antagonist properties, depending on actual dopaminergic tone. The antagonist-partial agonist properties of cariprazine at D-3 and D-2 receptors, with very high and preferential affinity to D-3 receptors, make it a candidate antipsychotic with a unique pharmacological profile among known antipsychotics.
