Arvanov, V. L. and R. Y. Wang (1998). "M100907, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and a potential antipsychotic drug, facilitates N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor mediated neurotransmission in the rat medial prefrontal cortical neurons in vitro." Neuropsychopharmacology 18(3): 197-209.

	The technique of intracellular recording was used to examine the effect of M100907 (formerly MDL 100907), a highly selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist and a potential antipsychotic drug (APD), on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and (+/-)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor-mediated responses in pyramidal cells of the rat medial prefrontal cortex in in vitro brain slice preparations. Bath administration of M100907, but not its inactive stereoisomer M100009, produced a 350% to 550% increase of NMDA-induced responses in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 14 nmol/L, reminiscent of the action of clozapine. M100907 did not alter AMPA responses. Moreover, M100907 significantly increased the amplitude and duration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials and currents evoked by electrical stimulation of the forceps minor. We have generated several lines of evidence indicating that M100907 enhances glutamate receptor-mediated neurotransmission in pyramidal cells of the medial prefrontal cortex by facilitating NMDA-induced release of excitatory amino acids. The robust potentiation of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission may explain, at least partly, the potential antipsychotic action of this compound. Furthermore, if M100907 proves to be an effective APD and if our findings can be extended to other atypical APDs, which are known to possess a relatively high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, they may account for the purported efficacy of atypical APDs in alleviating some negative symptoms such as cognitive and executive functions.
