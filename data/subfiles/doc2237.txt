Choi, K. H., et al. (2009). "Novel Tc-99m(CO)(3) Complexes with WAY-100635 Moiety for the Development of 5-HT1A Receptor Imaging Agent." Bulletin of the Korean Chemical Society 30(5): 1107-1112.

	The aim Of this Study is to develop and synthesize 5-HT1A receptor imaging agents with WAY-100635 moiety and Tc-99m(CO)(3) core. WAY-100635 is commonly known as 5-HT1A antagonist and its labeled compound ([C-11] WAY-100635) has been used as effective radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT1A receptors with PET(Positron Emission Tomography). However, there are several restrictions in using a radioisotope of C-11 and requires for more effective radioisotopes and ligands. In order to produce a structure most similar to WAY-100635, WAY-100635 derivatives containing a cysteine chelator were designed and confirmed by using in silico (Hyperchem). The novel compounds (7a, 7b, 7c) were prepared in five or 7 steps with yields of 16%, 36% and 42%, respectively and radiolabeled with [Tc-99m(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+). The labeling yield was 99% for all the newly synthesized compounds. [Tc-99m(CO)(3)]-WAY-100635 derivatives show a neutral charge which were confirmed by paper electrophoresis.
