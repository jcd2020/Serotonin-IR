	There is strong evidence that hippocampal 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) systems are affected in schizophrenia and hence we have studied a number of markers of the 5-HT system in hippocampi from subjects with schizophrenia. Using in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography we measured [(3)H]proplyamino-8-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapthalene, [(3)H]ketanserin and [(3)H]sumatriptan binding in hippocampi from 20 schizophrenic and 20 control subjects. There were significant decreases in the density of [(3)H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R) in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) 3 (p=0.006), CA 1 (stratum radiatum p=0.02; pyramidal layer p=0.0008) and subiculum (pyramidal layer p=0.0004), as well as methiothepin-insensitive [(3)H]sumatriptan binding to the 5-HT(1F)R in the CA 1 (p=0.016), stratum radiatum/lacunosum moleculare (p=0.04) and subiculum (p=0.015) from subjects with schizophrenia. There were no differences in the densities of 5-HT(1A)R, 5-HT(1D)R or 5-HT(4)R in hippocampi from subjects with schizophrenia. These data support the hypothesis that regionally specific reductions in the density of the 5-HT(2A)R and 5-HT(1F)R are a component of the pathological processes underlying schizophrenia.
