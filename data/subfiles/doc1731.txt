Cedillo, L. N., et al. (2019). "Effect of coadministration of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen and the 5-HT(2C) agonist Ro60-0175 on the expression of amphetamine-induced locomotor sensitization." Exp Brain Res 237(7): 1691-1697.

	GABA(B) and 5-HT(2C) agonists are effective in attenuating the behavioral effects of psychostimulants. However, they induce adverse side effects when used in high doses. The previous evidence has suggested that the 5HT(2C) receptor activation effect could be produced by an increased release of GABA in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the consequent activation of GABAergic receptors. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of joint administration of an intermediate dose of the GABA(B) agonist baclofen (3.0 mg/kg) with different doses of the 5HT(2C) agonist Ro60-0175 (0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg) on the locomotor sensitization expression induced by the repeated administration of amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg). Our results showed an attenuation of the expression of sensitization in a dose-dependent manner with both agonists. In both cases, we observed a complete blockade at the highest dose. In addition, the intermediate dose of baclofen increased the effects of the three doses of Ro60-0175. These results support the role of the joint action of GABA(B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors in the effects of psychostimulants. However, it remains to be explored whether the observed effect can be attributed to receptors located in the VTA or the nucleus accumbens.
