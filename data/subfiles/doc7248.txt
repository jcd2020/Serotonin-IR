Leopoldo, M., et al. (2007). "Structure - Activity relationship study on N-(1,2,3,4-Tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-4-aryl-1-piperazinehexanamides, a class of 5-HT7 receptor agents. 2." J Med Chem 50(17): 4214-4221.

	Here we report the synthesis of N-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-4-aryl-1-piperazinealkylamides 16-29 that were designed to elucidate both structure-affinity and -activity relationships for the 5-HT7 receptor, by targeting the substituent in 2-position of the aryl linked to the piperazine ring. The affinities of 16-29 for 5-HT7, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and D-2 receptors were assessed by radioligand binding assays. The intrinsic activities at the 5-HT7 receptor of the most potent compounds were determined. A series of substituents covering a wide range of electronic, steric, and polar properties was evaluated, revealing a key role on 5-HT7 receptor affinity and intrinsic activity. Certain lipophilic substituents (SCH3, CH(CH3)(2), N(CH3)(2), CH3, Ph) led to high-affinity agonists, whereas OH and NHCH3 substituents switched intrinsic activity toward antagonism. 4-[2-(1-Methylethyl)phenyl]-N-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-1-piperazinehexanamide (19), 4-(2-diphenyl)-N-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-1-piperazinehexanamide (21), and 4-(2-dimethylaminophenyl)-N-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-1-piperazinehexanamide (22) were identified as potent 5-HT7 receptor agonists (K-i = 0.13-1.1 nM, EC50 = 0.90-1.77 mu M), showing selectivity over 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and D-2 receptors.
