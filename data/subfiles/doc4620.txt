	This study investigated the possibility that overexpression of transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) changes those neurotransmitter systems that have been associated with behaviors found to be altered in the transgenic TGF alpha CD-1 mice. The female TGF alpha mice showed elevated levels of norepinephrine (NE) in the hypothalamus and serotonin (5-HT) in the cortex and brain stem when compared with nontransgenic CD-1 females. The concentrations of monoamines were not altered in the male transgenic brain. The 5-hydroxyindoleacitic acid (5-HIAA)/5-HT ratio was significantly reduced in the brain stem of the male TGF alpha mice and frontal cortex in the female transgenics. The binding of the [3H]GBR 12935-labeled DA transporter was lower in the frontal cortex in the transgenic male TGF alpha mice than in the female TGF alpha mice. No gender difference in dopamine (DA) transporter binding was noted between the nontransgenic male and female mice. Serotonin and GABAA receptors were measured only in males. No differences in the number of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors were found in the cortex or hippocampus. Maximal GABA stimulation of [3H]flunitrazepam binding in the forebrain hemispheres and cerebellar binding of an imidazobenzodiazepine, [3H]Ro 15-4513, were not different between transgenic and nontransgenic male mice. However, forebrain [35S]TBPS binding in male TGF alpha mice was less affected by the blockade of the GABA agonist sites by the specific GABAA antagonists SR 95531 and bicuculline than the binding of the controls, suggesting either altered endogenous GABA concentrations or a change in receptor populations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
