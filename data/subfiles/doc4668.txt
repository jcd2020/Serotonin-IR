	Substance P antagonists of the neurokinin-1 receptor type (NK1) are gaining growing interest as new antidepressant therapies. It has been postulated that these drugs exert this putative therapeutic effect without direct interactions with serotonin (5-HT) neurones. Our recent microdialysis experiment performed in NK1 receptor knockout mice suggested evidence of changes in 5-HT neuronal function (Froger et al. 2001). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of coadministration of the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine with a NK1 receptor antagonist (GR205171 or L733060), given either intraperitoneally (i.p.) or locally into the dorsal raphe nucleus, on extracellular levels of 5-HT ([5-HT]ext) in the frontal cortex and the dorsal raphe nucleus using in vivo microdialysis in awake, freely moving mice. The systemic or intraraphe administration of a NK1 receptor antagonist did not change basal cortical [5-HT]ext in mice. A single systemic dose of paroxetine (4 mg/kg; i.p.) resulted in a statistically significant increase in [5-HT]ext with a larger extent in the dorsal raphe nucleus (+ 138% over basal AUC values), than in the frontal cortex (+ 52% over basal AUC values). Co-administration of paroxetine (4 mg/kg; i.p.) with the NK1 receptor antagonists, GR205171 (30 mg/kg; i.p.) or L733060 (40 mg/kg; i.p.), potentiated the effects of paroxetine on cortical [5-HT]ext in wild-type mice, whereas GR205171 (30 mg/kg; i.p.) had no effect on paroxetine-induced increase in cortical [5-HT]ext in NK1 receptor knock-out mice. When GR205171 (300 mumol/L) was perfused by 'reverse microdialysis' into the dorsal raphe nucleus, it potentiated the effects of paroxetine on cortical [5-HT]ext, and inhibited paroxetine-induced increase in [5-HT]ext in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Finally, in mice whose 5-HT transporters were first blocked by a local perfusion of 1 mumol/L of citalopram into the frontal cortex, a single dose of paroxetine (4 mg/kg i.p.) decreased cortical 5-HT release, and GR205171 (30 mg/kg i.p.) reversed this effect. The present findings suggest that NK1 receptor antagonists, when combined with a SSRI, augment 5-HT release by modulating substance P/5-HT interactions in the dorsal raphe nucleus.
