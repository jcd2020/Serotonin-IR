	Impulsivity and compulsivity have emerged as important dimensional constructs that challenge traditional psychiatric classification systems. Both are present in normal healthy populations where the need to act quickly and repeatedly without hesitation can be highly advantageous. However, when excessively expressed, impulsive and compulsive behavior can lead to adverse consequences and spectrum disorders exemplified by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), autism, and drug addiction. Impulsive individuals have difficulty in deferring gratification and are inclined to 'jump the gun' and respond prematurely before sufficient information is gathered. Compulsivity involves repetitive behavior often motivated by the need to reduce or prevent anxiety, thus leading to the maladaptive perseveration of behavior. Defined in this way, impulsivity and compulsivity could be viewed as separate entities or 'traits' but overwhelming evidence indicates that both may be present in the same disorder, either concurrently or even separately at different time points. Herein we discuss the neural and cognitive heterogeneity of impulsive and compulsive endophenotypes. These constructs map onto distinct fronto-striatal neural and neurochemical structures interacting both at nodal convergent points and as opponent processes highlighting both the heterogeneity and the commonalities of function. We focus on discoveries made using both translational research methodologies and studies exclusively in humans, and implications for treatment intervention in disorders in which impulsive and compulsive symptoms prevail. We emphasize the relevance of these constructs for understanding dimensional psychiatry.
