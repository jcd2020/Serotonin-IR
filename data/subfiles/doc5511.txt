	The serotonergic regulation of feeding behaviour has not so far been studied in ruminants. Therefore, the effects of some serotonin (5-HT) receptor agonists and antagonists on food intake and forestomach motility were studied in dwarf goats. Goats ate less food when treated intravenously (IV) with the 5-HT precursor 5-HTP (25 micrograms, 50 micrograms or 100 micrograms kg-1 min-1 over 15 min) than when they were treated with 5-HT (which does not pass the blood-brain barrier) or with saline. Accordingly, IV dexfenfluramine infusions (50 micrograms or 100 micrograms kg-1 min-1 over 15 min), which induces release of brain 5-HT, also led to dose-related reductions in food intake. In contrast, no anorectic effects were observed after IV infusions with the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (100 micrograms kg-1 min-1 over 15 min), the selective 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT (0.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 over 15 min), or eltoprazine (4 or 8 micrograms kg-1 min-1 over 15 min), a mixed 5-HT1A/5HT1B receptor agonist. None of the 5-HT antagonists tested gave any increase in food consumption in this model. Interestingly, the non-selective 5-HT receptor antagonist methysergide (360 micrograms/kg IV) reduced food intake. This effect was most noticeable at 3 h after injection. The 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron (IV 10 micrograms kg-1 min-1 over 15 min) and the peripheral 5-HT2 receptor antagonist xylamidine (IV 100 micrograms kg-1 min-1 over 10 min) failed to modify food intake. These results provide evidence for central serotonergic involvement in the control of feeding. However, this control system differs markedly in goats and rodents. Dexfenfluramine, 5-HTP and eltoprazine administered at similar dose rates to those used in the food intake experiments induced some clinical signs including inhibition of forestomach contractions. These results, together with our earlier in vivo and in vitro observations, suggest that the inhibitory effects of serotonin receptor agonists on forestomach contractions are due to interactions with both peripheral and central serotonergic receptors. The change in smooth muscle tension, which leads to a change in the signals transmitted via vagal afferents to the central nervous system, appears not to modify feeding behaviour in dwarf goats.
