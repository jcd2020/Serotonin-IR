Shugalev, N. P., et al. (2007). "[Involvement of serotoninergic brain structures in the mechanisms of neurotensin effect on passive avoidance in rats]." Zh Vyssh Nerv Deiat Im I P Pavlova 57(3): 352-357.

	The purpose of the research was to reveal the features of neurotensin (administered in substantia nigra or dorsal raphe nucleus) effect on recall of passive avoidance reactions in rats. It was shown that the effect of neurotensin injected into the substantia nigra was characterized by a sharp reduction of passive avoidance reactions. On the contrary, injection of the substance in the dorsal raphe nucleus led to an intensification of these reactions and delay of their extinction. The effects of microinjections of serotonin 1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), into the mentioned brain structures was similar to that of neurotensin. Changes in the content of serotonin and its metabolite 5- hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the caudate nucleus corresponded to various behavioral effects. The conclusion was made that neurotensin effect on the passive avoidance behavior is related to regulation of emotional state of animals mediated by its action on the function of the serotoninergic brain structures.
