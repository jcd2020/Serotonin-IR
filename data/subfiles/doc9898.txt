	Kinetic analysis of binding of [H-3][N-[2-[4-(2-[O-methyl-H-3]methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexane carboxamide ([H-3]WAY100635) to 5-HT1A receptors in rat hippocampal membranes has revealed complex regulation mechanism for this radioligand. Saturation binding experiments revealed that [H-3]WAY100635 binds to a single class of receptors with very high apparent affinity (K-D = 87 +/- 4 pM, B-max = 15.1 +/- 0.2 fmol/mg protein). The binding was almost irreversible, as the dissociation rate constant obtained k(off) = (7.8 +/- 1.1) x 10(-3) min(-1), means that equilibrium with this radioligand cannot be achieved before 7.5 h incubation at 25 degrees C. Systematic association kinetic studies of [H-3]WAY100635 binding revealed sharp reaction acceleration at higher radioligand concentration, proposing mechanism of positive cooperativity. The affinities of antagonists determined from competition with [H-3]WAY100635 did not coincide with their abilities to inhibit 5-HT-dependent activation of [H-35]GTP gamma S binding probably due to the ligand's kinetic peculiarities. Thus, [H-3]WAY100635 appears to be an excellent tool for determining receptor binding sites, but its applicability in equilibrium studies is strongly limited.
