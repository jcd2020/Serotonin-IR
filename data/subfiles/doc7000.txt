Martin, L. P., et al. (1999). "Electrophysiological comparison of 5-Hydroxytryptamine1A receptor antagonists on dorsal raphe cell firing." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 288(2): 820-826.

	Single-unit recording studies were undertaken in chloral hydrate-anesthetized rats to compare the effects on dorsal raphe cell firing of several putative 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)1A receptor antagonists, including WAY 100635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide), p-MPPI (4-(2-methoxyphenyl)1-[2'-[N-(2"-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]ethyl] pip erazine), and two newly described 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, NDL-249 [(R)-3-(N-propylamino)-8-fluoro-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5-carboxamide] and NAD-299 [(R)-3-N, N-dicyclobutylamino-8-fluoro-3, 4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran-5-carboxamide]. Consistent with a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist profile, pretreatment with an approximately equimolar (0.02-0.03 micromol/kg) i.v. dose of each compound caused a significant rightward shift in the dose-response curve for 8-OH-DPAT [8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin]. Antagonist potency was clearly highest for NAD-299 and WAY 100635, which caused shifts roughly 3 times greater than those for either p-MPPI or NDL-249 (ED50 for 8-OH-DPAT, 1.3 +/- 0.3 microg/kg; after NAD-299, 18.2 +/- 1.0 microg/kg; after WAY 100635, 16.9 +/- 2.9 microg/kg; after NDL-249, 6.0 +/- 1.2 microg/kg; after p-MPPI, 4.7 +/- 1.1 microg/kg). In separate studies, each of the antagonists was administered alone in increasing cumulative doses to evaluate whether they possessed intrinsic agonist activity in this system. At doses below 0.01 micromol/kg, none of the drugs altered firing by more than +/-20% basal rates. At higher doses (>0.1 micromol/kg), WAY 100635, NDL-249, and NAD-299 caused a dose-dependent suppression of dorsal raphe cell firing (ED50 = 0.6 +/- 0.2, 0.7 +/- 0.3, and 0. 9 +/- 0.4 micromol/kg, respectively). However, the ED50 values for inhibition by these drugs were roughly 30 times higher than the doses that antagonized effects of 8-OH-DPAT. Moreover, the inhibition by all three antagonists (but not 8-OH-DPAT) was readily reversed by d-amphetamine (3.2 mg/kg i.v.), a releaser of norepinephrine, suggesting that these effects were likely due to alpha adrenergic receptor blockade rather than to 5-HT1A receptor agonism. Thus, it was concluded that WAY 100635, NAD-299, NDL-249, and p-MPPI all fulfill criteria as 5-HT1A receptor antagonists lacking intrinsic efficacy in the dorsal raphe system. The newly described compound NAD-299 exhibits antagonist potency comparable to that of WAY 100635 in this electrophysiological assay.
