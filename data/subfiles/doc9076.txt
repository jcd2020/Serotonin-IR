Pruus, K., et al. (2002). "Role of 5-HT1A receptors in the mediation of acute citalopram effects: a 8-OH-DPAT challenge study." Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry 26(2): 227-232.

	(1) The study was aimed to investigate the effects of the minimal effective doses of acute citalopram (5 mg/kg), (+/-)-8-hydroxydipropylaminotetralin HBr (8-OH-DPAT; 0.1 mg/kg), and their combined treatment on the rat open field and forced swimming behaviour and post-mortem monoamine content. (2) The animals were prospectively divided into the vehicle- and para-chlorophenylalanine (p-CPA)-pretreated (350 mg/kg) groups. (3) Acute citalopram (5 mg/kg), 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg), or their combined treatment had no major effect on the rat open field and forced swimming behaviour. (4) The post-mortem catecholamine content in four brain regions studied was unchanged in all treatment groups. (5) The combined 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mg/kg) and citalopram (5 mg/kg) treatment partially reversed the p-CPA-induced decrease of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxy-indolacetic acid (5-HIAA) content. (6) The present experiments demonstrate that the 5-HT1A receptors mediate some of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced biochemical phenomena.
