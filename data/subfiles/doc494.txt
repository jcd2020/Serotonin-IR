Avgustinovich, D. F., et al. (2010). "Effect of acute and chronic buspirone administration on communicativeness of mice with experience of defeats in social conflicts." Bull Exp Biol Med 149(1): 57-61.

	We studied the effect of 5-HT(1A)receptor agonist buspirone on behavior of male C57Bl/6J mice in the "partition" test, which reflects communicativeness of animals. Single administration of buspirone (1 mg/kg) to intact mice and animals experienced defeats in 20 intermale confrontations impaired their communicativeness, especially in intact animals. On the contrary, administration of buspirone (1 mg/kg) to losers starting from day 5 of intermale confrontations for 2 weeks produced a positive effect and prevented impairment of communicativeness by day 20 of confrontations. The role of brain 5-HT(1A)receptors in these processes is discussed.
