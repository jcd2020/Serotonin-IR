Huang, Y. Y. and E. R. Kandel (2007). "5-hydroxytryptamine induces a protein kinase A/mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated and macromolecular synthesis-dependent late phase of long-term potentiation in the amygdala." Journal of Neuroscience 27(12): 3111-3119.

	The amygdala is a critical site for the acquisition of learned fear memory in mammals, and the formation and long-term maintenance of fear memories are thought to be associated with changes of synaptic strength in the amygdala. Here we report that serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), a modulatory neurotransmitter known to be linked to learned fearful and emotional behavior, has dual effects on excitatory synaptic transmission in the basolateral amygdala. There is an early depression of synaptic transmission lasting 30-50 min, mediated by 5-HT1A, and a late, long-lasting facilitation lasting > 5 h in slice recordings, mediated by the 5-HT4 receptor. 5-HT late phase long-term potentiation (L-LTP) is blocked by inhibitors of either protein kinaseA(PKA) and/or mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK) and requires new protein synthesis and gene transcription. Moreover, the 5-HT-induced L-LTP in neurons of amygdala is blocked by the actin inhibitor cytochalasin D, suggesting that 5-HT stimulates a cytoskeletal rearrangement. These results show, for the first time, that 5-HT can produce long-lasting facilitation of synaptic transmission in the amygdala and provides evidence for the possible synaptic role of 5-HT in long-term memory for learned fear.
