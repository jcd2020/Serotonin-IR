	The present study was to investigate the role of central 5-HT and 5-HT1A receptor binding and gene expression in a rat model of pancreatic regeneration using 60% pancreatectomy. The pancreatic regeneration was evaluated by 5-HT content and 5-HT1A receptor gene expression in the cerebral cortex (CC) and brain stem (BS) of sham operated, 72 h and 7 days pancreatectomised rats. 5-HT content significantly increased in the CC (P < 0.01) and BS (P < 0.05) of 72 h pancreatectomised rats. Sympathetic activity was decreased as indicated by the significantly decreased norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) level (P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) in the plasma of 72 h pancreatectomised rats. 5-HT1A receptor density and affinity was decreased in the CC (P < 0.01) and BS (P < 0.01). These changes correlated with a diminished 5-HT(1A)receptor mRNA expression in the brain regions studied. Our results suggest that the brain 5-HT through 5-HT1A receptor has a functional role in the pancreatic regeneration through the sympathetic regulation.
