	1. The effects of calcium antagonists on behaviour mediated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) have been studied in rats and mice together with an investigation of the effects of these drugs on 5-HT synthesis in rat brain and endogenous 5-HT release from brain slices. 2. Administration of felodipine (35 mg kg-1 i.p.) to rats pretreated with tranylcypromine (20 mg kg-1, i.p.) resulted in the animals displaying the complete 5-HT-mediated behavioural syndrome (including head weaving, reciprocal forepaw treading and hind limb abduction) 75 min later. No evidence was obtained for the rate of 5-HT synthesis in brain regions differing between control and felodipine-treated rats. 3. Pretreatment with felodipine (10 or 35 mg kg-1) enhanced the 5-HT-mediated behavioural syndrome induced by injection of tranylcypromine and L-tryptophan. The rate of 5-HT accumulation in the brain was similar in both groups. Administration of Bay K 8644 (1 mg kg-1, i.p.) did not prevent the enhanced behaviour induced by felodipine (10 mg kg-1). 4. The 5-HT behavioural syndrome induced by injection of the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) was unaltered by either acute injection of felodipine (35 mg kg-1) or administration of felodipine twice daily for 3 days. 5. Felodipine (10 microM), verapamil (10 microM) and Bay K 8644 (10 microM) did not alter either basal release of endogenous 5-HT from slices prepared from frontal cortex or hind brain, or release following addition of K+ at a concentration of 20 mM, or 35 mM. 6. Verapamil (25mgkg-', i.p.), nicardipine (25mgkg-1, i.p.) and nifedipine (20mgkg-1, i.p.) all markedly inhibited the 5-HT2 receptor-mediated head twitch response in mice produced by injection of 5- methoxy-N,N-dimethyl-tryptamine (5-MeODMT). Felodipine had the same effect with an ED50 of 2.6mgkg-'. Bay K 8644 did not reverse this effect. Both verapamil (IC50:2.5 microM) and nicardipine (IC50:8 microM) were 5-HT2 antagonists as indicated by inhibition of [3H]-ketanserin binding in mouse frontal cortex. However felodipine and nifedipine antagonized 5-HT2 receptor binding only in the millimolar range.7. Hydralazine (5mg kg 1, i.p.) induced the 5-HT behavioural syndrome in tranylcypromine pretreated rats, enhanced the tranylcypromine/L-tryptophan behavioural syndrome, inhibited 5-MeODMT-induced head twitch behaviour in mice and was not a 5-HT2 receptor antagonist. 8. These data indicate that at a high dose, Ca2+ antagonists produce complex changes in 5-HT function in rodents which are similar to those produced by lithium administration. The data with hydralazine suggest that the effects seen are not related to an action at Ca2 + channels.
