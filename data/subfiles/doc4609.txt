	We have developed a polyclonal antibody directed against a peptide located in the third intracellular loop of the 5HT1B receptor. Its characterization was carried out using NIH cells stably transfected with a eukaryotic expression vector containing the mouse 5HT1B receptor cDNA. The synthetic antigenic peptide had a unique sequence to the mouse 5HT1B receptor corresponding to amino acids 273-287 localized in the third intracellular loop. In dot blot analysis, antisera detected 2 ng to 2 micrograms of synthetic peptide at dilutions of 1/200-1/20,000 and bound antibody was visualized using an immunoperoxidase procedure. Preimmune serum showed no immunoreactivity to the synthetic peptide. NIH cells stably transfected expressing mouse 5HT1B receptor displayed an intense immunoreactivity with the antiserum. In contrast no immunoreactivity was seen in any of the control experiments. In the present study, we have produced a specific antibody which is an essential tool suitable for immunocytochemical applications such as regional distribution, anatomical localization and phenotypical characterization of the cells expressing the 5HT1B receptors in brain by double immunolabelling procedure.
