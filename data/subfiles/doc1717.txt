Castro, M. E., et al. (1997). "Identification and characterization of a new serotonergic recognition site with high affinity for 5-carboxamidotryptamine in mammalian brain." J Neurochem 69(5): 2123-2131.

	We analyzed the existence of an additional serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtype, sensitive to 5-carboxamidotryptamine, in the mammalian brain. Radioligand binding studies with [3H]5-HT were carried out in rat, guinea pig, and human brain membranes, in the presence of unlabeled drugs to mask the binding to all known 5-HT receptors, with the exception of 5-HT1E sites. Under these conditions, unlabeled 5-carboxamidotryptamine still showed a biphasic competition curve with a nanomolar affinity component. Saturation studies with 5-[3H]carboxamidotryptamine were carried out in the presence of (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, mesulergine, and ergotamine, to mask the binding to all receptors known to be labeled by 5-carboxamidotryptamine. These studies showed the existence in cortex and hippocampus from guinea pig and human brain of a remaining binding site with high affinity (pK(D) = 7.8-8.1) and a unique pharmacological profile. 5-HT and 5-carboxamidotryptamine showed nanomolar affinity, whereas 5-methoxytryptamine recognized this binding site with intermediate affinity. Other drugs exhibited low or very low potency in inhibiting this binding. The addition of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate significantly reduced the number of binding sites labeled by 5-[3H]carboxamidotryptamine, in the presence of the masking drugs described above, indicating the interaction with a GTP-binding protein. Preliminary autoradiographic studies in human brain appear to indicate that this 5-HT binding site is present in areas such as the globus pallidus, neocortex, and hippocampus, among others.
