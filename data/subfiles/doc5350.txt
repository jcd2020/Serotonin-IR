	Dopamine D3 receptors may be involved in drug addiction and in disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. To determine the pharmacological properties of dopamine D3 receptors in the rat caudate-putamen, we have investigated R(+)-[3H]7-hydroxy-N,N-di-n-propyl-2-aminotetralin ([3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT) binding to membrane preparations from the rat caudate-putamen. Kinetic analyses showed that [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT binding reached equilibrium in approximately 1 h and that both association and dissociation curves were composed of at least two components. Likewise, saturation curves showed at least two binding components with a combined Bmax value of about 600 fmol/mg protein, which is three times higher than what is present in the subcortical limbic area. Competition curves were performed with agonists such as R(-)-propylnorapomorphine, dopamine, PD 128907, quinpirole, and bromocriptine, and antagonists such as haloperidol, raclopride, clozapine, GR 218231x, remoxipride, and U99194A. These experiments revealed that [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT binding could be resolved into three specific binding sites (R1-R3) and one nonspecific binding site, with R1-R2 probably representing D3 receptor binding and the minor R3 representing D2 receptor binding. The low affinities of (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT and 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine to inhibit [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT binding indicate negligible involvement of 5-HT1A or sigma binding sites, respectively. The pharmacological profile of [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT (2 nM) binding in the caudate-putamen was similar to that of dopamine on [125I]iodosulpride binding in the cerebellar lobule X, which contain D3 but not D2 receptors. Mg2+ increased and GTP and Na+ decreased the binding of [3H]R(+)-7-OH-DPAT, suggesting a coupling of endogenous D3 receptors to G proteins. Taken together, these results suggest that dopamine D3 receptors display multiple agonist binding states, and that D3 receptors are present in high concentrations in the rat caudate-putamen. These results may have implications for the physiological and pathological roles of dopamine D3 receptors in the brain.
