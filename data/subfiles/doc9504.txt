	Background. It has been proposed that serotonin participates in the central antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen. The serotonin activity in the brainstem is primarily under the control of 5-HT1A somatodendritic receptors, although some data also suggest the involvement of 5-HT1B receptors. In the presence of serotonin, the blockade of 5-HT1A/B receptors at the level of the raphe nuclei leads to an increase in serotonin release in terminal areas, thus improving serotonin functions. This study examines the involvement of 5-HT1A/B receptors in the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen in mice. Methods: The effects of acetaminophen (600 mg/kg intraperitoneal) followed by different doses of antagonists (WAY 100635 [0.2-0.8 mg/kg subcutaneous] and SB 216641 [0.2-0.8 mg/kg subcutaneous]) or agonists (8-OH-DPAT [0.25-1 mg/kg subcutaneous] and CP 93129 [0.125-0.5 mg/kg subcutaneous]) of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors, respectively, were determined in the hotplate test in mice. Results: Acetaminophen (300-800 mg/kg) showed a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the hot-plate test in mice. WAY 100635 (0.2-0.8 mg/kg; 5HT(1A) antagonist) induced an increase in the antinociceptive effect of 600 mg/kg acetaminophen, but this increase was not dose related. Conversely, 8-OHDPAT (0.25-1 mg/kg; 5-HT1A agonist) decreased the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen. SB 216641 (0.2-0.8 mg/kg; 5-HT1B antagonist) induced a dose-related increase in the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen, and CP 93129 (0.25 mg/kg; 5-HT1B agonist) significantly decreased the antinociceptive effect of acetaminophen. Conclusions: These results suggest that the combination of acetaminophen with compounds having 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B antagonist properties could be a new strategy to improve the analgesia of acetaminophen, thanks to its mild serotonergic properties.
