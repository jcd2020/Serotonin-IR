Nonogaki, K., et al. (2008). "Serotonin systems upregulate the expression of hypothalamic NUCB2 via 5-HT2C receptors and induce anorexia via a leptin-independent pathway in mice." Biochem Biophys Res Commun 372(1): 186-190.

	NEFA/nucleobindin2 (NUCB2), a novel satiety molecule, is associated with leptin-independent melanocortin signaling in the central nervous system. Here, we show that systemic administration of m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP), a serotonin 5-HT1B/2C receptor agonist, significantly increased the expression of hypothalamic NUCB2 in wild-type mice. The increases in hypothalamic NUCB2 expression induced by mCPP were attenuated in 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice. Systemic administration of mCPP suppressed food intake in db/db mice with leptin receptor mutation as well as lean control mice. On the other hand, the expression of hypothalamic NUCB2 and proopiomelanocortin (POMC) was significantly decreased in hyperphagic and non-obese 5-HT2C receptor mutants compared with age-matched wild-type mice. Interestingly, despite increased expression of hypothalamic POMC, hypothalamic NUCB2 expression was decreased in 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice with heterozygous mutation of beta-endorphin gene. These findings suggest that 5-HT systems upregulate the expression of hypothalamic NUCB2 via 5-HT2C receptors, and induce anorexia via a leptin-independent pathway in mice.
