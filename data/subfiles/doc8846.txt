Monti, J. M. and H. Jantos (2006). "Effects of the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 microinjected into the dorsal raphe nucleus on REM sleep in the rat." Behav Brain Res 167(2): 245-250.

	The effects of S13-269970, a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist oil spontaneous sleep were studied in adult rats implanted for chronic 269970 was infused directly into the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) during the light phase. The 5-HT7 receptor antagonist sleep recordings. S13(0.25-1.0mM ) induced a significant reduction of REM sleep and of the number of REM periods whereas REM sleep latency was augmented. Pretreatment with the GABA(A) receptor agonist muscimol (1.0-2.0 mM). which by itself did not affect sleep variables, prevented the decrease of REM sleep induced by SB-269970 (1.0 mM). Our results indicate that the 5-HT7 receptor is involved in the effect of DRINI serotonergic (5-HT) neurons on brainstem structures that act to promote and induce REM sleep. We propose that the S13-269970-induced suppression of REM sleep is dependent upon the inhibition of GABA release in the DRN. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
