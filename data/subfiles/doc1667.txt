Carro-Juárez, M. and G. Rodríguez-Manzo (2001). "Exhaustion of the coital reflex in spinal male rats is reversed by the serotonergic agonist 8-OH-DPAT." Behav Brain Res 118(2): 161-168.

	Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the genital motor pattern associated to the coital reflex in spinal male rats becomes exhausted when repeatedly evoked. Exhaustion of the genital motor pattern could be related to the sexual exhaustion phenomenon observed in copulating male rats. The present study was aimed to describe the features of coital reflex exhaustion and to determine if the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT was able to reverse exhaustion of this ejaculatory-like response. Additionally, the effect of pre-treatment with the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 on the 8-OH-DPAT induced motor response was evaluated. Results revealed that development of coital reflex exhaustion initiated with a progressive increase in the latency of response and was characterised by a change in the properties of the motor pattern itself. Once exhausted, i.v. administration of 8-OH-DPAT provoked the immediate expression of a potent motor pattern similar to the coital reflex, but in the absence of urethral stimulation. Injection of WAY 100635 induced, per se, expression of the coital reflex after exhaustion. Notwithstanding, pre-treatment with WAY 100635 was able to block the 8-OH-DPAT-induced motor response implying that its effect was exerted upon 5-HT1A receptors. Data suggest that the sexual exhaustion phenomenon might possess a spinal component.
