	In the present study, we investigated the effect of central serotonergic pathway activation achieved through third ventricle injections of quipazine, a serotonergic agonist, on plasma glucose levels of fasted and fed adult Wistar male rats, whose third ventricles were canulated 7 days before the experiments. Central quipazine administration induced a significant increase in plasma glucose levels in fasted animals, but was unable to modify plasma glucose concentrations in fed rats. Pretreatment with alpha-helical CRH, a CRH antagonist, significantly attenuated quipazine-induced hyperglycemia. Pretreatment with two different 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, LY-278,584 and ondansetron, was also able to produce a significant reduction in the hyperglycemic response evoked by central administration of quipazine. None of the antagonists used was capable of modifying plasma glucose concentrations when injected alone into the third ventricle. Quipazine-treated, hyperglycemic animals did not show any increase in plasma insulin levels. We conclude that acute pharmacological serotonergic stimulation by quipazine produces hyperglycemia by mechanisms that require the functional integrity of both CRH and 5-HT3 receptors, and that impairment in insulin secretion and/or activity may explain hyperglycemia induced by third ventricle injections of quipazine.
