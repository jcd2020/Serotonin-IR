	Chronic stress is known to affect brain areas involved in learning and emotional responses. These changes, thought to be related to the development of cognitive deficits are evident in major depressive disorder and other stress-related pathophysiologies. The serotonin-related transcription factors (Freud-1/CC2D1A; five prime repressor element under dual repression/coiled-coil C2 domain la, and NUDR/Deaf-1; nuclear-deformed epidermal autoregulatory factor) are two important regulators of the 5-HT1A receptor. Using Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) we examined the expression of mRNA and proteins for Freud-1, NUDR, and the 5-HT1A receptor in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male rats exposed to chronic restraint stress (CRS; 6 h/day for 21 days). After 21 days of CRS, significant reductions in both Freud-1 mRNA and protein were observed in the PFC (36.8% and 32%, respectively; P<0.001), while the levels of both NUDR protein and mRNA did not change significantly. Consistent with reduced Freud-1 protein, 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels were equally upregulated in the PFC, while protein levels actually declined, suggesting post-transcriptional receptor downregulation. The data suggest that CRS produces distinct alterations in the serotonin system specifically altering Freud-1 and the 5-HT1A receptor in the PFC of the male rat while having no effect on NUDR. These results point to the importance of understanding the mechanism for the differential regulation of Freud-1 and NUDR in the PFC as a basis for understanding the related effects of chronic stress on the serotonin system (serotonin-related transcription factors) and stress-related disorders like depression.
