	Serotonin (5-HT) is an important neurotransmitter which regulates various biological responses, some of which are potentially important in the pathogenesis of stress-related diseases such as generalized anxiety. 5-HT produces its biological effects by stimulating specific 5-HT receptors. Among these, the 5-HT1A receptor has been the focus of considerable research since the early 1980s. This receptor subtype is widely distributed in the central nervous system and is located both presynaptically, on 5-HT cell bodies in the raphe nuclei of the brainstem, and postsynaptically, in particular. in limbic structures. A considerable body of evidence indicates that the activation of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors yields anxiolytic activity. The recent availability of compounds that selectively block 5-HT1A receptors has prompted speculation about their potential to modulate emotional behaviors. Studies in animals show that 5-HT1A receptor antagonists display anxiolytic-like actions, but the magnitude of these effects is generally smaller than that of benzodiazepine anxiolytics. However, comparisons with 5-HT1A receptor agonists such as buspirone, a compound currently used in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorders, suggest that the anxiety-reducing potential of 5-HT1A receptor antagonists may be superior to that of full or partial agonists for this receptor. Clinical trials with 5-HT1A receptor antagonists in patients with anxiety disorders will eventually determine whether such compounds may be useful in the treatment of these conditions.
