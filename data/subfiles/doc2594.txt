Depoortere, R., et al. (2010). "F15599, a preferential post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptor agonist: Activity in models of cognition in comparison with reference 5-HT1A receptor agonists." European Neuropsychopharmacology 20(9): 641-654.

	We assessed the activity of F15599, a selective and high efficacy 5-HT1A agonist that preferentially activates post- versus pre-synaptic receptors, in rat cognition/memory models. F15599 (0.16 mg/kg i.p.) partially alleviated detrimental effects of phencyclidine on working and reference memory deficit in a hole-board model. It also attenuated phencyclidine-induced deficit of cognitive flexibility in a reversal learning task, without effects of its own. F13714 (0.04 mg/kg) a chemical congener of F15599, and 8-OH-DPAT (0.01 or 0.16), were inactive against these phencyclidine-induced deficits, and/or even worsened basal performances. F15599 (0.04-2.5) was less disruptive than F13714 (0.005-0.16) or 8-OH-DPAT (0.01-0.63), on basal performance in models of attention (5-choice serial reaction time task) and working memory (delayed non-matching to position). Finally, unlike either comparator, F15599 reduced PPI with modest potency and only partially. To conclude, F15599, in models of memory/cognition, has a more favourable profile than F13714 and 8-OH-DPAT. This suggests that preferential activation of post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors could prove useful in pathologies characterized by cognitive/memory deficiencies, such as schizophrenia and depression.
