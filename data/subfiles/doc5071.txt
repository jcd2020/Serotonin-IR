Hatcher, J. P., et al. (1995). "The 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, granisetron and ondansetron, do not affect cocaine-induced shifts in intra-cranial self-stimulation thresholds." Journal of Psychopharmacology 9(4): 342-347.

	The effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, granisetron and ondansetron, were investigated on behaviour maintained by intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS). Rats, implanted with bipolar electrodes in the lateral hypothalamus, were trained to lever press on a continuous reinforcement schedule for positively reinforcing trains of electrical stimulation. The frequency at which responding reached 50% of maximum (M50) and the maximum rate of responding (asymptote) were used to measure drug effects. Granisetron (0.01-0.1 mg/kg i.p.) and ondansetron (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on either parameter. In contrast, cocaine (20 mg/kg i.p.) potentiated rewarded responding, reducing M50 values, but neither granisetron (0.01-3.0 mg/kg i.p.) nor ondansetron (0.03-0.3 mg/kg i.p.) blocked this effect. Neither did granisetron (0.1-10.0 mg/kg i.p.) alter the effect of lower doses of cocaine (10 mg/kg i.p.). These data suggest that 5-HT3 receptors do not play a significant role in mediating responding maintained by ICSS in the rat through hypothalamic electrodes. Neither do they modulate cocaine-induced potentiation of the behaviour.
