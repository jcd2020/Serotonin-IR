Kwong, L. L., et al. (1986). "Differential interactions of "prosexual" drugs with 5-hydroxytryptamine1A and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors." Behav Neurosci 100(5): 664-668.

	Radioligand binding studies were used to analyze the interactions of six "prosexual" drugs with 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5-HT1A) and alpha 2-adrenergic receptors in rat brain membranes. Three drugs that facilitate seminal emissions and/or ejaculations [8-hydroxy-2-n-propylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT), 5-methoxy-dimethyltryptamine, and RDS-127] are potent and selective inhibitors of [3H]8-OH-DPAT binding to 5-HT1A receptors. By contrast, three drugs with primary sexual arousal effects (yohimbine, imiloxan, and idazoxan), are potent agents at alpha 2-adrenergic receptors labeled by [3H]yohimbine. These data suggest that radioligand binding analysis of prosexual agents may elucidate the pathophysiology of sexual behavior.
