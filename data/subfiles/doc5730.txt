	In the companion paper, we showed that the spontaneous firing activity of DRN 5-HT neurons is significantly higher in male (M) than in freely cycling female (CF) rats. Moreover, during pregnancy, it increased in parallel to circulating levels of progesterone, peaking at day 17 of pregnancy (P17). In this second part, we assessed the role of three regulatory mechanisms potentially involved in these modifications of the 5-HT neurons firing activity. During pregnancy, the ED(50) for the response to LSD was decreased by about 70%, indicating a partial desensitization of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, which is consistent with the 5-HT neurons higher firing activity. The GABAergic tonic inhibition of 5-HT neurons was assessed using the responses to GABA, bicuculline and isoniazid. Together, they indicate a lower GABAergic tonic inhibition in males and P17 as compared to CF, which is in agreement with their greater 5-HT neurons firing rate. Finally, the efficacy of the long feedback loop, involving postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptors, did not seem affected by gender, ovariectomy or pregnancy since the response to systemic 8-OH-DPAT was similar. These results constitute strong evidence of mechanisms by which gender and hormonal fluctuations can modulate the 5-HT neurons function and influence vulnerability to mood disorders.
