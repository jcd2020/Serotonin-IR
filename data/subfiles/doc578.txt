	Serotonin reuptake inhibitors used for the treatment of depression act by increasing serotonin levels at the synaptic cleft and thereby activating 5-HTlA serotonin receptors. However, the effect of increased levels of serotonin on postsynaptic 5-HTlA receptor density is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in a culture model, how postsynaptic 5HT(lA) receptors are influenced by serotonin. Different concentrations of serotonin (0.5, 1, 10, 50 and 100 muM) were added to organotypic hippocampal cultures and incubated for I week. The cultures were immunostained for the 5-HTlA receptor and the staining analyzed dens ito metrically. 5-HTlA levels decreased with increasing serotonin concentrations, being significant at 10, 50 and 100 muM. These results indicate that at increasing serotonin levels the density of postsynaptic 5-HTlA receptors is down-regulated. NeuroReport 12:3909-3912 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
