Okazawa, H., et al. (1999). "Effects of acute and chronic administration of the serotonina(1A) agonist buspirone on serotonin synthesis in the rat brain." Journal of Neurochemistry 72(5): 2022-2031.

	The effects of acute and chronic administration of buspirone, a serotonin 5-HT(1A) agonist, on the 5-HT synthesis rates in various rat brain structures were investigated using alpha-[(14)C]methyl-L-tryptophan (alpha-[(14)C]MTrp) and an autoradiographic method. In the acute treatment study, buspirone (10 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously 30 min before alpha-[(14)C]MTrp administration (30 mu Ci over 2 min) into a femoral vein. In the chronic treatment study, buspirone was given in a sustained fashion (10 mg/kg/day) for 14 days using an osmotic minipump implanted subcutaneously. Rats were killed 60 and 150 min after alpha-[(14)C]MTrp administration (two-time point method). A single dose of buspirone induced a significant decrease of 5-HT synthesis throughout the brain with the exception of the pineal body. However, the chronic treatment with buspirone did not induce significant differences in 5-HT synthesis in the brain. There was no significant difference in plasma free tryptophan concentration between any of the groups. The unaltered 5-HT synthesis rates in the chronic treatment study likely reflect a normalization of this parameter due to a desensitization of 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors on the cell body of 5-HT neurons, which has been previously shown to occur following long-term treatment with 5-HT(1A) agonists.
