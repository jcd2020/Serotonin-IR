	The localization of serotonin(2A) (5-HT2A) receptors in the adult rat spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia was examined by using a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the C-terminus peptides of the mouse 5-HT2A receptor. Positive cell bodies of 5-HT2A receptor were found in several regions of the spinal cord. Generally, large-to-intermediate sized neuronal cell bodies were intensely immunolabeled. Motoneurons in the ventral horn were the most intensely labeled. Dot-like immunoreactive profiles were located beneath the cell membrane of motoneurons. Neuronal somata in the intermediolateral nucleus of the thoracic spinal cord were moderately labeled. The immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn was weak. A considerable number of glial cell bodies in the while matter were immunostained. The majority of both small and large sized neurons were 5-HT2A immunopositive in the dorsal root ganglion.
