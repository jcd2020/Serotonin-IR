Kostowski, W., et al. (1989). "Intra-hippocampal buspirone in animal models of anxiety." Eur J Pharmacol 168(3): 393-396.

	The effect of intra-hippocampal injections of the serotonergic 5-HT1A receptor agonist, buspirone, on rat exploratory activity was evaluated in the 'open field' and 'elevated plus maze' tests. The dose of 2.5 micrograms, but not of 1 microgram, of buspirone administered to the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus increased the time spent on exploration of open arms in the elevated plus maze, as well as it increased the number of central entries in the open field. The results indicate an anti-emotional influence of local stimulation of 5-HT1A receptors by buspirone.
