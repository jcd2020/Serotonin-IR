Haleem, D. J., et al. (1989). "8-OH-DPAT increases corticosterone but not other 5-HT1A receptor-dependent responses more in females." Eur J Pharmacol 164(3): 435-443.

	The 5-HT1A receptor subtype agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (50-1000 micrograms/kg s.c.) dose dependently increased rat plasma corticosterone. Tube restraint for 30 min also increased plasma corticosterone; this effect was completely blocked by (-)-pindolol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Increases of corticosterone following either 8-OH-DPAT injection or restraint were significantly greater in female animals. The restraint stress-induced changes but not those due to 8-OH-DPAT were decreased by pretreatment with the tranquiliser chlordiazepoxide (10 mg/kg i.p.). In anaesthetized rats, restraint no longer significantly affected corticosterone levels but 8-OH-DPAT caused increases which (though much attenuated) were significantly greater in the females. Dose-dependent increases of plasma corticosterone also resulted on infusing 8-OH-DPAT (500-1500 ng) into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus; increases were significantly greater in the females. As mentioned in the discussion, these results may be relevant to the greater incidents of depression in women and the possible role of adrenal corticoids in the illness.
