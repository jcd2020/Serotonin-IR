	Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is an ancient chemical that is synthesized in the brain and also in the peripheral system. It binds to 14 or more receptor proteins, all but one of which are G protein-coupled receptors. Pharmacological, behavioral, and clinical studies have placed one of these receptors, the serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) receptor, in the forefront as a protein that binds to 5-HT with high affinity to exert subtle control over emotion and behavior. This review will compare and contrast existing data on expression and signaling activity of the brain 5-HT1A receptor. Our purpose is to critically assess the current understanding of those 5-HT1A R-mediated signaling cascades that are physiologically important and also to unravel the poorly understood processes that have yet to be delineated through further experiments.
