	Long-term (18 h) activation of 5-HT1A receptors alters 5-HT1A receptor-G protein coupling and leads to heterologous sensitization of adenylate cyclase. In contrast, the effects of short-term (2 h) 5-HT1A receptor activation on subsequent adenylate cyclase activity have not been determined. The present study examined and characterized 5-HTIA receptor-induced heterologous sensitization following short-term activation in CHO-5-HT1A cells. Short-term activation of 5-HT1A receptors with full agonists, as well as the partial agonist, buspirone, markedly enhanced subsequent forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. This heterologous sensitization was evident after 30 min treatment with 5HT and appeared to be near maximal following 2 It agonist treatment. Sensitization was characterized by a dose-dependent increase in forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation and was prevented by WAY 100635 or by pertussis toxin treatment. The ability of the 5-HTIA agonists to induce heterologous sensitization was not significantly altered by agents shown previously to modulate 5-HT1A-mediated inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation.
