Garcia, R., et al. (2005). "Synthesis and biological evaluation of S- C-11 methylated mercaptoimidazole piperazinyl derivatives as potential radioligands for imaging 5-HT1A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET)." J Labelled Comp Radiopharm 48(4): 301-315.

	The novel 2-mercaptoimidazole derivatives, 1-[4-((2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-butyl]-2-mercaptoimidazole (3) and methyl[4-((2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl))butyl] (2-mercapto-1-methylimidazol-5-yl)methanamide (8), were efficiently labelled with C-11 through methylation of the thioketone function with [C-11]methyl iodide. The resulting radioligands 1-[4-((2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl))butyl]-2-thio[C-11]methylimidazole ([C-11]9) and methyl[4-((2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl))butyl] (2-thio[C-11]methyl-1-methylimidazol-5-yl)-methanamide ([C-11]10) were synthesized in radiochemical yields of 20-30% (decay-corrected, related to [C-11]CO2) at a specific radioactivity of 0.2-0.40/mu mol within 40-45min including HPLC-purification. The radiochemical purity exceeded 99%. The reference compounds 9 and 10 were tested in a competitive receptor binding assay to determine their affinity toward the 5-HT1A receptor. Both compounds exhibit excellent sub-nanomolar affinities (IC50 = 0.576 +/- 0.008 nM (9); IC50 = 0.86 +/- 0.02 nM (10)) for the 5-HT1A receptor while displaying a high selectivity towards the 5-HT2A subtype of receptors (IC50 > 480nM). By contrast, compound 9 also shows substantial binding for the alpha I-adrenergic receptor (IC50 = 3.00 +/- 0.02 nM) when compared with compound 10 (IC50 = 54.5 +/- 0.6 nM). Preliminary biodistribution studies in rats showed an initial brain uptake of 1.14 +/- 0.11 and 0.37 +/- 0.04% ID/g after 5 min, which decreased to 0.18 +/- 0.04 and 0.16 +/- 0.01% ID/g after 60 min for compounds [C-11]9 and [C-11]10, respectively. For both compounds, the cerebellum and rest of the brain uptake are very similar at the different time points. Unlike [C-11]9, the radioligand [C-11]10 has significant uptake and retention in the adrenal glands. Due to their washout from the brain compounds [C-11]9 and [C-11]10 seem not to be good candidates as radioligands for imaging 5-HT1A receptors by PET. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
