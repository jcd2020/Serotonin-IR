Mir, A. K., et al. (1988). "MDL 72832: a potent and stereoselective ligand at central and peripheral 5-HT1A receptors." Eur J Pharmacol 149(1-2): 107-120.

	In receptor binding assays (+/-)MDL 72832, 8-[4-(1,4-benzodioxan-2-ylmethylamino)butyl]-8-azaspiro++ +[4,5] decane-7,9-dione, was a potent (pIC50 9.1), selective and stereospecific ligand for central 5-HT1A recognition sites. In functional tests, (+/-)MDL 72832 and its S(-) and R(+) enantiomers blocked stereoselectively the 8-OH-DPAT-induced neuronal inhibition of the transmurally stimulated guinea-pig ileum and the cardiovascular effects of 8-OH-DPAT in anaesthetized rats. In contrast, (+/-)MDL 72832 and its enantiomers were exclusively '8-OH-DPAT-like' in their ability to fully and stereoselectively generalize to the 8-OH-DPAT discriminative stimulus and, in reserpinised rats, to induce forepaw treading and flat body posture. These results characterize (+/-)MDL 72832 as a potent, stereoselective ligand with mixed agonist and antagonist properties at central and peripheral 5-HT1A receptors. The similar stereoselective requirements for the recognition site and functional effects provides compelling evidence that the 5-HT1A recognition site is indeed a functional receptor.
