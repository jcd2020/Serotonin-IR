	Kiss1, a neuropeptide predominantly expressed in the habenula, modulates the serotonin (5-HT) system to decrease odorant cue [alarm substance (AS)]-evoked fear behaviour in the zebrafish. The purpose of this study was to assess the interaction of Kiss1 with the 5-HT system as well as to determine the involvement of the 5-HT receptor subtypes in AS-evoked fear. We utilized 0. 28 mg/kg WAY 100635 (WAY), a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, to observe the effects of Kiss1 administration on AS-evoked fear. We found WAY significantly inhibited the anxiolytic effects of Kiss1 (p < 0.001) with an exception of freezing behaviour. Based on this, we utilized 92.79 mg/kg methysergide, a 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, and found that methysergide significantly blocked the anxiolytic effects of Kiss1 in the presence of the AS (p < 0.001). From this, we conclude that Kiss1 modulates AS-evoked fear responses mediated by the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors. Kiss1 peptide intracranially (IC) administrated has been shown to decrease olfactory, alarm substance (AS)-evoked fear response. Blockade of the 5-HT1A receptor utilizing WAY 100635 (0.28 mg/kg) and the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor utilizing methysergide (92.79 mg/kg) produced increased AS-evoked fear responses that were unable to be overcome even during the recovery period. Blockade of this 5-HT system followed by Kiss1 administration showed that the peptide was unable to recover the anxiolytic effects upon 5-HT1A blocking using WAY 100635 with the exception of freezing behaviour while methysergide significantly blocked all the anxiolytic effects of Kiss1. These findings implicate that Kiss1 could modulate AS-evoked fear responses mediated by 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors.
