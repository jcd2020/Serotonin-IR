Ase, A. R., et al. (2001). "Regional changes in density of serotonin transporter in the brain of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B knockout mice, and of serotonin innervation in the 5-HT1B knockout." J Neurochem 78(3): 619-630.

	5-HT1A knockout (KO) mice display an anxious-like phenotype, whereas 5-HT1B KOs are over-aggressive. To identify serotoninergic correlates of these altered behaviors, autoradiographic measurements of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B serotonin (5-HT) receptors and transporter (5-HTT) were obtained using the radioligands [3H]8-OH-DPAT, [125I]cyanopindolol and [3H]citalopram, respectively. By comparison to wild-type, density of 5-HT1B receptors was unchanged throughout brain in 5-HT1A KOs, and that of 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. In contrast, decreases in density of 5-HTT binding were measured in several brain regions of both genotypes. Moreover, 5-HTT binding density was significantly increased in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of the 5-HT1B KOs. Measurements of 5-HT axon length and number of axon varicosities by quantitative 5-HT immunocytochemistry revealed proportional increases in the density of 5-HT innervation in these two regions of 5-HT1B KOs, whereas none of the decreases in 5-HTT binding sites were associated with any such changes. Several conclusions could be drawn from these results: (i) 5-HT1B receptors do not adapt in 5-HT1A KOs, nor do 5-HT1A receptors in 5-HT1B KOs. (ii) 5-HTT is down-regulated in several brain regions of 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B KO mice. (iii) This down-regulation could contribute to the anxious-like phenotype of the 5-HT1A KOs, by reducing 5-HT clearance in several territories of 5-HT innervation. (iv) The 5-HT hyperinnervation in the amygdalo-hippocampal nucleus and ventral hippocampus of 5-HT1B KOs could play a role in their increased aggressiveness, and might also explain their better performance in some cognitive tests. (v) These increases in density of 5-HT innervation provide the first evidence for a negative control of 5-HT neuron growth mediated by 5-HT1B receptors.
