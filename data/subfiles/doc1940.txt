Choi, Y. K., et al. (2009). "Subchronic effects of phencyclidine on dopamine and serotonin receptors: implications for schizophrenia." J Mol Neurosci 38(3): 227-235.

	Changes in representative dopamine (D(1), D(2), and D(4)) and serotonin (5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A)) receptors that have been implicated in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia were autoradiographically quantified after subchronic phencyclidine (PCP) treatment (2 mg/kg for 7 days, bi-daily followed by 7 days drug free). This treatment has consistently induced robust and long-lasting cognitive deficits in adult rats, although the molecular mechanisms contributing to PCP-induced cognitive deficits remain undefined. Repeated PCP treatment significantly decreased labeling of D(1) receptors in the medial and lateral caudate-putamen (22% and 23%, respectively) and increased 5HT(1A) receptor binding in the medial-prefrontal (26%) and dorsolateral-frontal cortex (30%). No changes in D(1) or 5HT(1A) receptors were detected in other brain regions. These findings suggest that downregulation of striatal D(1) receptors and upregulation of cortical 5HT(1A) receptors may contribute to PCP-induced impairment of cognitive functions in rats. Subchronic PCP treatment did not alter levels of D(2), D(4), and 5HT(2A) receptors in all brain regions examined, which suggests a minimal role for these receptors in mediating subchronic actions of PCP in adult rats.
