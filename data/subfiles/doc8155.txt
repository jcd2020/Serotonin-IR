Nikolaus, S., et al. (2016). "Different patterns of 5-HT receptor and transporter dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disorders--a comparative analysis of in vivo imaging findings." Rev Neurosci 27(1): 27-59.

	Impairment of serotonin receptor and transporter function is increasingly recognized to play a major role in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases including anxiety disorder (AD), major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BD) and schizophrenia (SZ). We conducted a PubMed search, which provided a total of 136 in vivo studies with PET and SPECT, in which 5-HT synthesis, 5-HT transporter binding, 5-HT1 receptor binding or 5-HT2 receptor binding in patients with the primary diagnosis of acute AD, MDD, BD or SZ was compared to healthy individuals. A retrospective analysis revealed that AD, MDD, BD and SZ differed as to affected brain region(s), affected synaptic constituent(s) and extent as well as direction of dysfunction in terms of either sensitization or desensitization of transporter and receptor binding sites.
