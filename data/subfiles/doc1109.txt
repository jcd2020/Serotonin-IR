Billecocq, A., et al. (1994). "Characterization of galanin and 5-HT1A receptor coupling to adenylyl cyclase in discrete regions of the rat brain." Eur J Pharmacol 269(2): 209-217.

	We have studied the coupling of galanin and 5-HT1A receptors with adenylyl cyclase in the hypothalamus, the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus of the rat brain. Furthermore, we have evaluated the effects of simultaneous activation of galanin and 5-HT1A receptors on adenylyl cyclase activity. Galanin-(1-29) and galanin-(1-15) showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the hypothalamus and entorhinal cortex. No clear effects were observed in the hippocampus. Neither galanin-(1-29) nor galanin-(1-15) had any effect on the basal activity of adenylyl cyclase in these regions. The selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) induced a dose-dependent inhibition of forskolin stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. 5-HT induced an inhibition in the hypothalamus. In all regions the effects could be fully counteracted by methiothepin. 5-HT was shown to stimulate the basal activity of adenylyl cyclase in the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. The effects could be counteracted by methiothepin. When galanin-(1-29) and 5-HT/8-OH-DPAT were incubated simultaneously additive inhibitory effects, but no synergistic interactions, could be observed on the stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. In conclusion, galanin and 5-HT1A receptors seem to be linked to different independent pools of G proteins, indicating that the previously demonstrated intramembrane interactions between galanin and 5-HT1A receptors involve a mechanism not directly related to adenylyl cyclase.
