Pascual, J., et al. (1996). "Autoradiographic distribution of [3H]sumatriptan-binding sites in post-mortem human brain." Cephalalgia 16(5): 317-322.

	The anatomical distribution of [3H]sumatriptan-binding sites was analysed in brain tissue sections from 11 subjects. Relevant concentrations of [3H]sumatriptan-binding sites were seen in areas such as visual cortex > locus niger > globus pallidus > layers IV-V of the frontal cortex > subiculum > entorhinal cortex > nucleus tractus solitarius > nucleus trigeminalis caudalis. This distribution of [3H]sumatriptan-binding sites in the human brain shows some differences when compared with that of 5HT1D receptors, confirming that, besides 5HT1D, sumatriptan also binds to 5HT1F receptor subtype. Some species differences are evident between the distribution of [3H]sumatriptan-binding sites in the human brain and that reported for guinea-pig and rat brains, emphasizing that caution is needed in extrapolating experimental data from animals to humans. Furthermore, these data help to explain some of the therapeutic actions of sumatriptan. The remarkable levels of binding found in areas as nucleus tractus solitarius and nucleus trigeminalis caudalis suggest that in migraine attacks sumatriptan could exert its specific anti-emetic effects and, partly at least, induce analgesia by directly acting over these brain nuclei.
