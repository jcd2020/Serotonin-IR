Tsai, C. L., et al. (2002). "Role of serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and glutamate in the behavioral thermoregulation of female tilapia during the prespawning phase." J Exp Zool 293(5): 443-449.

	The role of hypothalamic neurotransmitter systems in behavioral thermoregulation was investigated in the prespawning female tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus. Intrahypothalamic microinjection with serotonin (5-HT, 3 microliters of 1.0 x 10(-6) M) resulted in a significant increase in the selected temperature. This effect was mimicked by the agonist of 5-HT1A, 1B, and 2C receptors, N-3-trifluoromethylphenyl piperazine. Intrahypothalamic microinjection of tilapia with gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) resulted in a biphasic effect of the temperature selection, whereas microinjection with muscimol, an agonist of GABAA receptor, had no effect on temperature selection. Both agonist and antagonist of glutamate (Glu), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and MK-801 (1.0 x 10(-6) M), a noncompetitive blocker of NMDA receptor, significantly decreased the preferred temperature. These results indicate that the hypothalamic 5-HT, GABA, and Glu systems play a role in the temperature selection of prespawning female tilapia.
