Davidson, C. and J. A. Stamford (1995). "Evidence that 5-hydroxytryptamine release in rat dorsal raphe nucleus is controlled by 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D autoreceptors." Br J Pharmacol 114(6): 1107-1109.

	Electrically stimulated 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) release was monitored in slices of rat dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by fast cyclic voltammetry. Pseudo-single pulse stimulations (5 pulses at 100 Hz) were used to enable the effect of various receptor agonists to be seen without competition from endogenously released transmitter. The selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, (+)-8-OH-DPAT (1.0 microM) decreased stimulated 5-HT release to 31 +/- 3% of controls. This decrease was inhibited by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, (+)-WAY-100135 (1.0 microM) and WAY-100635 (0.1 microM) but not by the 5-HT1D/B antagonist, GR127935 (0.05 microM). The selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist, CP-93129 (0.3 microM) decreased stimulated 5-HT release to 61 +/- 4% of control. This effect was antagonized by the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, isamoltane (0.5 microM) but not by (+)-WAY-100135. The 5-HT1D agonist, sumatriptan (0.5 microM) decreased stimulated 5-HT release to 52 +/- 2% of controls. This decrease was blocked by GR-127935 but not by WAY-100635. These results suggest that 5-HT release in the rat DRN is under the control of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D autoreceptors.
