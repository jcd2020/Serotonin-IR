Borsini, F., et al. (2011). "5-HT6 pharmacology inconsistencies." Pharmacology Biochemistry and Behavior 98(2): 169-172.

	5-HT6 receptors are relatively recently-discovered receptors. After an uncertain beginning, where results were ambiguous, findings are now apparently more congruent. Nevertheless, discrepancies still exist. The aim of the present manuscript is to point out some of these discrepancies, in order to reflect on the current status of the field of the 5-HT6 receptor neuropharmacology, and where the field should move next. Examples of 5-HT6 receptor ligand-induced changes in behavior, neurochemistry and binding highlight areas where discrepancies remain and further experimental attention is needed. Possible methodological as well as conceptual issues underlying the inconsistencies are considered in an effort to increase awareness of the need for more thorough consideration of these aspects in future research.
