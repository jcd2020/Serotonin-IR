Orer, H. S., et al. (2008). "Role of serotonergic input to the ventrolateral medulla in expression of the 10-Hz sympathetic nerve rhythm." Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 294(5): R1435-1444.

	We studied the changes in inferior cardiac sympathetic nerve discharge (SND) produced by unilateral microinjections of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptor agonists and antagonists into the ventrolateral medulla (VLM) of urethane-anesthetized, baroreceptor-denervated cats. Microinjection of the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist LY-53857 (10 mM) into either the rostral or caudal VLM significantly reduced (P < or = 0.05) the 10-Hz rhythmic component of basal SND without affecting its lower-frequency, aperiodic component. The selective depression of 10-Hz power was accompanied by a statistically significant decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP). Microinjection of LY-53857 into the VLM also attenuated the increase in 10-Hz power that followed tetanic stimulation of depressor sites in the caudal medullary raphÃ© nuclei. Microinjection of the 5-HT2 receptor agonist 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-amino-propane (DOI; 10 microM) into the VLM selectively enhanced 10-Hz SND, and intravenous DOI (1 mg/kg) partially reversed the reduction in 10-Hz SND produced by 5-HT2 receptor blockade in the VLM. Microinjection of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OHDPAT; 10 mM), into either the rostral or caudal VLM also selectively attenuated 10-Hz SND and significantly reduced MAP. The reduction in 10-Hz SND produced by 8-OHDPAT was partially reversed by intravenous WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg), which selectively blocks 5-HT1A receptors. These results support the view that serotonergic inputs to the VLM play an important role in expression of the 10-Hz rhythm in SND.
