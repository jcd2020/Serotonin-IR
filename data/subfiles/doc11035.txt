Thor, K. B., et al. (1990). "Discrete localization of high-density 5-HT1A binding sites in the midline raphe and parapyramidal region of the ventral medulla oblongata of the rat." Neurosci Lett 108(3): 249-254.

	Serotonergic agonists that interact with the 5-HT1A receptor subtype cause marked decreases in blood pressure when administered to the medulla oblongata. In the present study, specific binding of the 5-HT1A-specific ligand, [3H]8-OH-DPAT, was determined in sections of the rat medulla oblongata using autoradiographic techniques. The highest density of binding was associated with the midline raphe nuclei and the parapyramidal regions of the rostral ventral medulla, areas that contain serotonergic neurons. Administration of the serotonergic neurotoxin, 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT), 2 weeks prior to sacrifice, resulted in a marked loss of binding in the medullary raphe nuclei and the parapyramidal region. These results demonstrate the presence of 5-HT1A binding sites in discrete regions of the ventral medulla and are consistent with the hypothesis that 5-HT1A agonists reduce blood pressure by directly suppressing the activity of serotonergic neurons in the ventral medulla.
