Matsuyama, S., et al. (1997). "Regulation of GABA release via NMDA and 5-HT1A receptors in guinea pig dentate gyrus." Brain Res 761(1): 105-112.

	The regulation by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 5-HT1A receptors of the endogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) release was investigated in slices of the guinea pig dentate gyrus. The release of GABA was increased in a concentration-dependent fashion by NMDA. The release of GABA evoked by NMDA was Ca2+-dependent, tetrodotoxin-resistant, Mg2+-sensitive and inhibited by MK-801, a selective non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the NMDA receptor present on GABAergic neurons is involved in the stimulatory regulation of GABA release. The release of GABA was increased concentration-dependently by NAN-190, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, but was not affected by 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. The release of GABA evoked by NAN-190 was Ca2+-dependent, tetrodotoxin-resistant and inhibited by 8-OH-DPAT. These results suggest that the 5-HT1A receptor present on GABAergic neurons is involved in the inhibitory regulation of GABA release. The release of GABA evoked by NMDA from the dentate gyrus was inhibited by pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT. The release of GABA evoked by NAN-190 was inhibited by pretreatment with MK-801. The release of GABA evoked by NMDA from the dentate gyrus was augmented by the concurrent application of NAN-190. Taken together, the results indicate that the NMDA receptor and the 5-HT1A receptor, which are both located on GABAergic neurons in the guinea pig dentate gyrus, exert stimulatory and inhibitory regulation of neuronal GABA release, respectively.
