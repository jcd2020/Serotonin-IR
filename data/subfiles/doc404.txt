	reserved. Peripheral administration of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elicits anorexia in several species, including rats and mice. There is strong evidence that antagonism of serotonergic activity at 2C receptors (5-HT2cR) attenuates LPS anorexia in rats. Here we used pharmacological and genetic approaches to examine the role of the 5-HT2cR in LPS anorexia in mice. In Experiment 1, SB 242084, a potent and selective 5-HT2C antagonist (0.3 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally 15 min before intraperitoneal LPS (2 mu g/kg) injections just prior to dark onset in c57BL/6 mice. Food intake was recorded 1, 2 and 4 It after LPS administration. In Experiment 2, we recorded 2, 4 and 24 h food intake following dark onset intraperitoneal LPS (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 mu g/kg) injections in mice with a genetic deletion of 5-HT2CR and their WT controls. Our pharmacological results suggest that at least part of the anorexia following peripheral LPS administration is mediated by an increase in 5-HT-ergic activity at the 5-HT2CR. Our genetic data, in contrast, suggest that 5-HT2cR, is not a necessary part of LPS anorexia. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
