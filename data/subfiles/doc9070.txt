Muraki, I., et al. (2001). "Effect of subchronic lithium treatment on citalopram-induced increases in extracellular concentrations of serotonin in the medial prefrontal cortex." J Neurochem 76(2): 490-497.

	We investigated the effect of citalopram [a selective serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor; SSRI] and MKC-242 (a selective 5-HT1A agonist), following treatment with subchronic lithium (p.o., 1 week) on extracellular 5-HT concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Acute treatment with citalopram (3 and 30 mg/kg) led to significant increases in extracellular 5-HT concentrations. The subchronic lithium group showed significantly higher basal levels of extracellular 5-HT than normal diet controls. Acute citalopram (3 and 30 mg/kg) treatment together with subchronic lithium treatment showed significant increases in the extracellular 5-HT concentrations, compared with citalopram treatment alone. Acute MKC-242 (1 mg/kg) treatment showed significant decreases in extracellular 5-HT concentrations, in both the normal diet and lithium diet groups to the same extent. The addition of lithium did not change the effect of the 5-HT1A agonist on extracellular 5-HT concentrations. This study suggests that lithium augmentation of the antidepressant effect of SSRI is mediated by the additional increases in extracellular 5-HT concentrations following the co-administrations of lithium and SSRI.
