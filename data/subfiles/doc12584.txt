	1 (6-((R)-2-[2-[4-(4-Chloro-phenoxy)-piperidin-1-yl]-ethyl]-pyrrolidine-1-sulphonyl )-1H-indole hydrochloride) (SB-656104-A), a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(7)) receptor antagonist, potently inhibited [(3)H]-SB-269970 binding to the human cloned 5-HT(7(a)) (pK(i) 8.7+/-0.1) and 5-HT(7(b)) (pK(i) 8.5+/-0.2) receptor variants and the rat native receptor (pK(i) 8.8+/-0.2). The compound displayed at least 30-fold selectivity for the human 5-HT(7(a)) receptor versus other human cloned 5-HT receptors apart from the 5-HT(1D) receptor ( approximately 10-fold selective). 2 SB-656104-A antagonised competitively the 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT)-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP in h5-HT(7(a))/HEK293 cells with a pA(2) of 8.5. 3 Following a constant rate iv infusion to steady state in rats, SB-656104 had a blood clearance (CL(b)) of 58+/-6 ml min(-1) kg(-1) and was CNS penetrant with a steady-state brain : blood ratio of 0.9 : 1. Following i.p. administration to rats (10 mg kg(-1)), the compound displayed a t(1/2) of 1.4 h with mean brain and blood concentrations (at 1 h after dosing) of 0.80 and 1.0 micro M, respectively. 4 SB-656104-A produced a significant reversal of the 5-CT-induced hypothermic effect in guinea pigs, a pharmacodynamic model of 5-HT(7) receptor interaction in vivo (ED(50) 2 mg kg(-1)). 5 SB-656104-A, administered to rats at the beginning of the sleep period (CT 0), significantly increased the latency to onset of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep at 30 mg kg(-1) i.p. (+93%) and reduced the total amount of REM sleep at 10 and 30 mg kg(-1) i.p. with no significant effect on the latency to, or amount of, non-REM sleep. SB-269970-A produced qualitatively similar effects in the same study. 6 In summary, SB-656104-A is a novel 5-HT(7) receptor antagonist which has been utilised in the present study to provide further evidence for a role for 5-HT(7) receptors in the modulation of REM sleep.
