	Using in vivo electrophysiological procedures, we confirm the inhibitory effect of 10-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)pyrido[4,3-b][1,4]benzothiazepine (JL 3), on dorsal raphe serotonergic (IC50 = 14 mu M) and noradrenergic neurons (IC50 = 4.5 mu M). The effect on dorsal raphe neurons was reduced by N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinyl-cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635), suggesting the importance of 5-HT1A receptor stimulation. Yohimbine, and ritanserin, to a lesser extent, blocked the inhibitory effect of JL 3 on locus coeruleus neurons indicating that alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and 5-HT2A receptors may be implicated in the effects. Because of its negligible alpha(2)-adrenoceptor affinity, the effect of JL 3 on locus coeruleus neurons, would have to be indirect. JL, 3 may interfere with the norepinephrine transporter site (IC50 = 0.34 mu M). JL 3 tended to reinforce the hypertensive effect of norepinephrine, while it strongly inhibited the hypertensive effect of tyramine, further indicating an interaction at the norepinephrine transporter site level.
