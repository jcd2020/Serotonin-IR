Millan, M. J., et al. (2004). "S32504, a novel naphtoxazine agonist at dopamine D3/D2 receptors: III. Actions in models of potential antidepressive and anxiolytic activity in comparison with ropinirole." J Pharmacol Exp Ther 309(3): 936-950.

	In forced-swim tests in mice and rats, the novel D(3)/D(2) receptor agonist S32504 [(+)-trans-3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-9-carbamoyl-4-propyl-2H-naphth[1,2-b]-1,4-oxazine] dose-dependently (0.04-2.5 mg/kg) and stereospecifically suppressed immobility compared with its enantiomer S32601 [(-)-trans-3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-9-carbamoyl-4-propyl-2H-naphth-[1,2-b]-1,4-oxazine]. Ropinirole was less potent than S32504 in this procedure, and it was likewise less potent than S32504 (0.04-2.5 mg/kg) in attenuating motor-suppressant properties of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist S18616 [(S)-spiro[(1-oxa-2-amino-3-azacyclopent-2-ene)-4,2'-(1',2',3',4'-tetrahydronaphthalene)]]. In a learned helplessness paradigm, S32504 (0.08-2.5 mg/kg) suppressed escape failures. Furthermore, in a chronic mild stress model of anhedonia, S32504 (0.16-2.5 mg/kg) rapidly restored the suppression of sucrose consumption. S32504 inhibited marble-burying behavior in mice (0.04-0.16 mg/kg) and aggressive behavior in isolated mice (0.04-2.5 mg/kg): only higher doses of ropinirole mimicked these actions of S32504. In tests of anxiolytic activity, S32504 was more potent (0.0025-0.16 mg/kg) than ropinirole in suppressing fear-induced ultrasonic vocalizations, and S32601 was inactive. Furthermore, in contrast to ropinirole, S32504 modestly enhanced punished responses in a Vogel conflict procedure and increased open-arm entries in a plus-maze. At doses active in the above-described procedures, S32504 did not elicit hyperlocomotion. In the forced-swim, marble-burying, and ultrasonic vocalization models, actions of S32504 were blocked by the D(2)/D(3) antagonists haloperidol and raclopride and by the D(2) antagonist L741,626 [4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(1H-indol-3-ylmethyl)piperidin-4-ol], but not by the D(3) receptor antagonist S33084 [(3aR,9bS)-N-[4-(8-cyano-1,3a,4,9b-tetrahydro-3H-benzopyrano[3,4-c]pyrrole-2-yl)-butyl]-(4-phenyl)benzamide. Finally, chronic administration of S32504 did not, in contrast to venlafaxine, modify corticolimbic levels of serotonin(2A) receptors or brain-derived neurotrophic factor. In conclusion, S32504 displays a broad and distinctive profile of activity in models of potential antidepressive and anxiolytic properties. Its actions are more pronounced than those of ropinirole and principally involve engagement of D(2) receptors.
