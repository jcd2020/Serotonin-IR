Vasar, E., et al. (1993). "ONDANSETRON, AN ANTAGONIST OF 5-HT3-RECEPTORS, ANTAGONIZES THE ANTIEXPLORATORY EFFECT OF CERULEIN, AN AGONIST OF CCK-RECEPTORS, IN THE ELEVATED PLUS-MAZE." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 110(1-2): 213-218.

	Systemic treatment with caerulein (0.25-5 mug/kg SC), non-selective agonist of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors, dose-dependently suppressed the exploratory behaviour of rats in an elevated plus-maze without producing remarkable changes in the locomotor activity of animals in an open field test. Ondansetron, a selective antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors, increased the number of open arm entries in the plus-maze test only at a dose 10 mug/kg. The other doses of ondansetron (0.1, 1 and 100 mug/kg IP) did not significantly change either the locomotor activity or the exploratory behaviour of rats. Pretreatment of rats with ondansetron (at 10 mug/kg, but not at 0.1, 1 or 100 mug/kg) completely reversed the anti-exploratory effect of caerulein (5 mug/kg). The concomitant treatment with cacrulein and ondansetron did not cause any major change in the locomotor activity of animals in open field. Consequently, we propose that 5-HT-ergic mechanisms are involved not only in the regulation of CCK release in the cerebral cortex and nucleus accumbens, but also in the modulation of the anti-exploratory effect of caerulein, a CCK agonist, in the elevated plus-maze.
