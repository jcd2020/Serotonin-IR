	In this study, we demonstrate that astroglial 5-HT2A receptors are linked to the mobilization of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Stimulation of C6 glioma cells, prelabeled with [(3)Hlarachidonate (AA, 20:4n6) and [C-14]docosahexaenoate (DHA, 22:6n3), with serotonin and the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist(+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI) resulted in the mobilization of both [H-3] and [C-14] into the supernatant of the cell monolayers. The increased radioactivity in the supernatant was mainly associated with free fatty acids. Experiments using inhibitors of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C and PLA(2), inhibited the DOI-stimulated mobilization of AA and DHA, suggesting the involvement of both phospholipases. Ketanserin (1 mu M), a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, and MDL 100,907 (R(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)]-1-[2-(4-fluophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine-methanol) (1 mu M), a highly selective antagonist for 5-HT2A receptors, significantly decreased the DOI-stimulated release of AA and DHA. These results indicate that the 5-HT2A receptor is coupled to the mobilization of PUFA. The release of AA and DHA in response to serotonin may represent a mechanism through which astroglia provide these polyunsaturated fatty acids to neurons. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.
