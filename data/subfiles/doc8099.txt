	Interaction at dopamine D-4 receptors may improve cognitive function, which is highly impaired in individuals with schizophrenia, but comparative studies of recent antipsychotics in cellular models of D, receptor activation are lacking. Here, we report the in-vitro profile of over 30 ligands at recombinant hD(4.4) receptors. In [S-35]GTP gamma S binding experiments using membranes of CHO-hD(4.4) cells, apomorphine, preclamol and the selective D-4 agonists, ABT724, CP226269, Ro-10-5824 and PD168077, behaved as partial agonists (E-max 20-60% vs. dopamine), whereas L745870 and RBI257, displayed antagonist properties. The 'conventional' antipsychotic, haloperidol and the 'atypicals', clozapine and risperidone, exhibited antagonist properties, while 'third generation' compounds bifeprunox, SLV313 and FI5063, acted as partial agonists; (10-30%). Aripiprazole and SSR181507 slightly stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding at micromolar concentrations. In Xenopus laevis oocytes co-expressing hD(4).(4) receptors with G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, apomorphine, preclamol, ABT724, CP226269, and PD168077 stimulated GIRK currents (E-max 70-80%). The 5-HT1A receptor ligands, WAY100635 and flibanserin, also exhibited partial agonist activity (30% and 15%, respectively). Haloperidol, clozapine, olanzapine and nemonapride did not stimulate GlRK currents, whereas aripiprazole, bifeprunox, SLV313 and F15063, but not SSR181507, exhibited partial agonism (E-max 20-35%). In-vitro responses depended on experimental conditions: increasing NaCl concentration (30 mM to 100 mM) reduced agonist efficacy in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, whereas decreasing the amount of hD(4.4) cRNA injected into oocytes (from 2.0 to 0.5 ng/oocyte) reduced agonist efficacy of several compounds. These data indicate that, unlike conventional or 'atypical' antipsychotics, several 'third generation' agents display D-4 receptor partial agonism that may be sufficient to influence physiological D-4 receptor activity in vivo.
