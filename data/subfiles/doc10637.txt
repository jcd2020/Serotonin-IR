	Inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) with N-[2-methylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (H-8) almost completely antagonized the increase in 5-HTP accumulation and 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in hypothalamus induced by NAS-181, a 5-HT1B receptor antagonist, but had no effect when the mice were treated with NAS-181 together with WAY-100,635, a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. Inhibition of Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaM kinase II) with the calmodulin antagonist N-(4-aminobutyl)-5-chloro-2-naphtalenesulfonamide (W-13) did not antagonise the effect of NAS-181 alone, but counteracted that evoked by the combined treatment with NAS-181 and WAY-100,635. The results indicate that activation of tryptophan hydroxylase by reducing the tone from terminal 5-HT1B receptors involves PKA whereas the depolarisation-induced activation of tryptophan hydroxylase involves CaM kinase II. The increase in the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio may under the experimental conditions used suggest CaM kinase II-induced phosphorylation of synapsin I resulting in increased 5-HT release.
