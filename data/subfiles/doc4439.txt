	OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of 5-HT2A-receptors coupled with superoxide anion (O2-) on respiratory regulation signal transductionin passageway in the medial area of nucleus retrofacialis (mNRF). METHODS: mNRF island was prepared from medullary slices of neonatal SD rats according to Johnson's method and transferred separately into 24-well culture plates with reagents according to protocol, followed by incubation for 60 min at 37 degrees C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Absorbance of 100 microl supernatant was measured by spectrophotometry at 550 nm and the effect of 5-HT and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine hydrochloride (DOI, agonist of 5-HT2A-receptors) on O2- generation in the mNRF was observed, along with the inhibition of this effect by ketanserin (antagonist of 5-HT2A-receptors) and alpha-lipoic acid (alpha-LA, a antioxidant). RESULTS: 5-HT concentration-response curve demonstrated that absorbance peak occurred at 1 micromol/L without further increment with higher concentration. DOI concentration-response curve showed the absorbance peak at 20 micromol/L without further increment. 5-HT and DOI significantly increased the absorbance with comparable effects. Ketanserin and alpha-LA significantly decreased the absorbance generated by 5-HT and DOI. CONCLUSION: Activation of 5-HT2A receptors results in obvious O2- production in mNRF, suggesting that 5-HT2A receptors regulate respiratory function in association with O2-.
