Yamaguchi, T., et al. (1997). "Evidence for 5-HT4 receptor involvement in the enhancement of acetylcholine release by p-chloroamphetamine in rat frontal cortex." Brain Res 772(1-2): 95-101.

	The roles of endogenous serotonin (5-HT) and 5-HT receptor subtypes in regulation of acetylcholine (ACh) release in frontal cortex of conscious rats were examined using a microdialysis technique. Systemic administration (1 and 3 mg/kg, i.p.) of the 5-HT-releasing agent p-chloroamphetamine (PCA) elevated ACh output in a dose-dependent manner. Depletion of endogenous 5-HT by p-chlorophenylalanine significantly attenuated the facilitatory effect of PCA on ACh release. The PCA (3 mg/kg)-induced increase in ACh release was significantly inhibited by local application of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonists RS23597 (50 microM) and GR113803 (1 microM), while the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100135 (10 mg/kg, i.p.; 100 microM), 5-HT(1A/1B)/beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (-)-pindolol (8 mg/kg, i.p.) and (-)-propranolol (150 microM), 5-HT(2A/2C) antagonist ritanserin (1 mg/kg, i.p.; 10 microM) and 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron (1 mg/kg, i.p.; 10 microM) failed to significantly modify the effect of PCA. These results suggest that PCA-induced enhancement of 5-HT transmission facilitates ACh release from rat frontal cortex at least in part through 5-HT4 receptors.
