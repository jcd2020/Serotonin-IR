Fletcher, P. J. and M. Davies (1990). "A pharmacological analysis of the eating response induced by 8-OH-DPAT injected into the dorsal raphé nucleus reveals the involvement of a dopaminergic mechanism." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 100(2): 188-194.

	Direct injection of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) into the dorsal raphé nucleus (DRN) dose dependently increased food intake in free feeding rats. The hypothesis that this effect is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors was tested by investigating the abilities of the putative 5-HT1A antagonists metergoline, propranolol and spiperone to prevent 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating. Metergoline failed to affect 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating when injected either peripherally or into the DRN. Peripherally injected propranolol and spiperone prevented 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating, but these drugs were ineffective when injected into the DRN. These results indicate that 8-OH-DPAT-induced eating may not involve 5-HT1A receptors within the DRN. The ability of peripherally injected spiperone to prevent the eating response to 8-OH-DPAT reflects its dopamine blocking activity since haloperidol was an effective antagonist of 8-OH-DPAT-eating. This result may indicate that 8-OH-DPAT produces a general behavioural activation by reducing the inhibitory influence which 5-HT normally exerts over the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway, and that this behavioural activation is expressed as eating when food is the most salient goal object present.
