	The immediate serotonin (5-HT) precursor, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (L-5-HTP), is an investigational treatment for myoclonic disorders. Its mechanism of action in humans is incompletely understood. We measured the density of subtypes of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptors and the affinity of 5-HT and L-5-HTP in vitro in the human brainstem and cortex, regions associated with subcortical and cortical myoclonus, respectively. In the cortex, the rank order of 5-HT receptor subtype Bmax was 5-HT2A (low-affinity), 5-HT1A, 5-HT uptake sites, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2C, 5-HT1E/F, and 5-HT2A (high-affinity) sites. In the brainstem, the rank order was 5-HT uptake sites, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2C, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A(L) sites. Specific binding at 5-HT1E/F and high-affinity 5-HT2A sites was too low for characterization. In competition studies, 5-HT had high affinity for 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C sites in the brainstem and cortex, but L-5-HTP was > 1,000-fold less active. These data support the hypothesis that in humans L-5-HTP stimulates 5-HT receptors in the CNS only after conversion to 5-HT. They also indicate in the human brainstem a prominence of 5-HT1A sites and paucity of 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E/F, and 5-HT2A sites, which has implications for brainstem-mediated myoclonus and response to serotonergic drugs.
