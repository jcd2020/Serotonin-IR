Cole, D. C., et al. (2007). "Discovery of N1-(6-chloroimidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-sulfonyl)tryptamine as a potent, selective, and orally active 5-HT(6) receptor agonist." J Med Chem 50(23): 5535-5538.

	N1-Arylsulfonyltryptamines have been identified as 5-HT6 receptor ligands. In particular, N1-(6-chloroimidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-sulfonyl)tryptamine (11q) is a high affinity, potent full agonist (5-HT6 Ki = 2 nM, EC50 = 6.5 nM, Emax = 95.5%). Compound 11q is selective in a panel of over 40 receptors and ion channels, has good pharmacokinetic profile, has been shown to increase GABA levels in the rat frontal cortex, and is active in the schedule-induced polydipsia model for obsessive compulsive disorders.
