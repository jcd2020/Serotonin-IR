Staley, J. K., et al. (2001). "Comparison of F-18 altanserin and F-18 deuteroaltanserin for PET imaging of serotonin(2A) receptors in baboon brain: pharmacological studies." Nucl Med Biol 28(3): 271-279.

	The regional distribution in brain, distribution volumes, and pharmacological specificity of the PET 5-HT2A receptor radiotracer [F-18]deuteroaltanserin were evaluated and compared to those of its non-deuterated derivative [F-18]altanserin. Both radiotracers were administered to baboons by bolus plus constant infusion and PET images were acquired up to 8 h. The time-activity curves for both tracers stabilized between 4 and 6 h. The ratio of total and free parent to metabolites was not significantly different between radiotracers; nevertheless, total cortical R-T (equilibrium ratio of specific to nondisplaceable brain uptake) was significantly higher (34-78%) for [F-18]deuteroaltanserin than for [F-18]altanserin. In contrast, the binding potential (B-max/K-D) was similar between radiotracers. [F-18]Deuteroaltanserin cortical activity was displaced by the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist SR 46349B but was not altered by changes in endogenous 5-HT induced by fenfluramine. These findings suggest that [F-18]deuteroaltanserin is essentially equivalent to [F-18]altanserin for 5-HT2A receptor imaging in the baboon. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.
