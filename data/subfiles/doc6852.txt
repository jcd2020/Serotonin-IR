	Serotonergic abnormalities have been identified in the brain of suicide victims independent of psychiatric diagnosis. We report the first study of serotonin 5-HT3 receptors in the brain of suicide victims. There were no differences in the number (Bmax) or affinity (KD) of 5-HT3 receptors in the temporal cortex of suicide victims compared to matched controls. There was a negative correlation between brain serotonin levels and receptor number (r = -0.5, p = 0.04) in both groups. This study indicates that alterations in serotonergic function in the brain of suicide victims do not appear to directly involve the 5-HT3 receptor.
