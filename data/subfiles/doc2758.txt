Davydova, S. M. and G. V. Idova (2007). "[Presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in immunomodulation]." Ross Fiziol Zh Im I M Sechenova 93(10): 1156-1162.

	It is shown that a selective agonist of 5-HT1A receptors 8-OH-DPAT in a low dose (0.1 mg/kg), which is known to affect mainly the presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors increased the immune response at the peak of reactions (the forth or fifth day after immunization with sheep red blood cells - SRBC) in CBA mice and Wistar rats. Treatment of the animals with the drug 15 min prior to antigen injection raised the number of plaque-forming cells (lgM-PFC) and rosette-forming cells (RFC) in the spleen. The preliminary blockade of 5-HT1A receptor with a selective antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors WAY-100635 (0.1 mg/kg) prevented the immunostimulating effect of 5-HT 1A receptors agonist 8-OH-DPAT, whereas WAY-100635 administration alone in the same dose didn't change the immune response. Activation of 5-HT1A receptors under conditions of electrical lesion of 5-HTergic neurons of the nucleus raphe was unable to enhance the immune reactions, as it did in sham-operated rats. The data obtained indicate that the somatodendric 5-HT1A autoreceptors are involved in immunomodulation.
