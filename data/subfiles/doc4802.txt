	Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) is a required enzyme for the formation of catecholamines, indolamines and trace amines. AAAD gene and protein analyses have provided evidence for enzyme activity regulation at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Extensive studies in neuronal tissues have demonstrated that AAAD activity is regulated by activation and induction, protein phosphorylation and gene transcription. A number of neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine (D1-4), glutamate (NMDA), serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate AAAD activity in the rodent brain. Generally, receptor antagonists enhance AAAD activity; while, agonists have no effect or diminish it. Second messenger systems, particularly cAMP, participate in the short- and long-term enzyme regulation in the brain. Following a lesion of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, AAAD in striatum responds more robustly to pharmacological manipulations indicating ability for compensatory responses. We provide a historical perspective of the current knowledge and review evidence supporting the notion that AAAD is a regulated enzyme. Because of the importance of AAAD for L-DOPA treatment in Parkinson disease, we propose that this knowledge can be exploited for the benefit of Parkinson patients.
