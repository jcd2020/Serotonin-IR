Ferguson, S. M., et al. (2008). "Increased expression of 5-HT6 receptors in the nucleus accumbens blocks the rewarding but not psychomotor activating properties of cocaine." Biological Psychiatry 63(2): 207-213.

	Background: Repeated exposure to cocaine produces enduring forms of drug experience-dependent behavioral plasticity, including conditioned place preference (CPP) and psychomotor sensitization, a progressive and persistent increase in cocaine's psychomotor activating effects. Although serotonin-6 receptors (5-HT(6)Rs) are abundantly expressed in the brain regions thought to underlie these phenomena, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc), surprisingly little is known about the role of 5-HT(6)Rs in the rewarding and psychomotor activating effects of cocaine. Methods: Viral-mediated gene transfer was used to selectively increase 5-HT6R expression in the NAc of rats. The effects of 5-HT6R overexpression and the selective 5-HT6R antagonist Ro4368554 on CPP and psychomotor sensitization were examined. Results: Increased expression of 5-HT(6)Rs in the NAc blocks a CPP to cocaine but has no effect on either the acute locomotor response to cocaine or on the development of cocaine-induced locomotor sensitization. Furthermore, antagonism of 5-HT(6)Rs facilitates the acquisition of a CPP to cocaine but has no effect on cocaine-induced stereotypy. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that 5-HT(6)Rs in the NAc can selectively modulate drug reward, possibly through facilitation of reward learning.
