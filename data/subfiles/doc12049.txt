	(S)-UH-301 (( -)-(S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetral in hydrochloride) is a well known 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. The present Study describes the pharmacokinetic properties of (S)-UH-301 after subcutaneous administration in rats, using a newly developed HPLC-UV bioanalytical method, The relationships between (S)-UH-301 concentrations and some pharmacodynamic effects were also studied. The AUC of (S)-UH-301 in brain, but not in plasma, increased in proportion to dose (1-100 mumol/kg). However, at doses above 32 mumol/kg, peak concentrations of the drug did not increase in proportion to dose. and there was a doubling of its apparent half-life. There was a good correspondence between the time courses for the antagonism of 8-OH-DPAT-induced motor behaviours and hypothermia and the tissue concentrations of (S)-UH-301. Doses of (S)-UH-301 above 10 mumol/kg decreased 5-HT and dopamine synthesis. Therefore, a selective 5-HT1A antagonistic dose range of (S)-UH-301 should be 0.1-10 mumol/kg s.c,, corresponding to concentrations below approximate to10 nmol/g in brain and approximate to1 nmol/ml in plasma.
