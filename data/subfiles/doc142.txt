Akdemir, A., et al. (2012). "Identification of novel alpha 7 nicotinic receptor ligands by in silico screening against the crystal structure of a chimeric alpha 7 receptor ligand binding domain." Bioorg Med Chem 20(19): 5992-6002.

	A hierarchical in silico screening procedure using the crystal structure of an agonist bound chimeric alpha 7/Ls-AChBP protein was successfully applied to both proprietary and commercial databases containing drug-like molecules. An overall hit rate of 26% (pK(i) > 5.0) was obtained, with an even better hit rate of 35% for the commercial compound collection. Structurally novel and diverse ligands were identified. Binding studies with [H-3]epibatidine on chimeric alpha 7/5-HT3 receptors yielded submicromolar inhibition constants for identified hits. Compared to a previous screening procedure that utilized the wild type Ls-AChBP crystal structure, the current study shows that the recently obtained alpha 7/Ls-AChBP chimeric protein crystal structure is a better template for the identification of novel alpha 7 receptor ligands.
