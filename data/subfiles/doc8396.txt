	It has been suggested that sigma receptor antagonists may be useful as antipsychotic drugs. N, N-dipropyl-2-[4-methoxy-3-(2-phenylethoxy)phenyl]-ethylamine monohydrochloride (NE-100) is a novel compound with high affinity for the sigma receptor (IC50 = 4.16 nM), but low affinity (IC50 > 10000 nM) for D1, D2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2 and phencyclidine (PCP) receptors. The head-weaving behavior induced by either (+)SKF10047 or PCP was dose-dependently antagonized by NE-100 with oral ED50 at 0.27 and 0.12 mg/kg, respectively. NE-100 did not affect dopamine agonists-induced stereotyped behavior and/or hyperactivity. NE-100 failed to induce catalepsy in rats. These findings indicate that NE-100 may have antipsychotic activity without the liability of motor side effects typical of neuroleptics.
