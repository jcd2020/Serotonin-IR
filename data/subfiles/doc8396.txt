Melena, J., et al. (2000). "Blockade of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT: possible significance for neuroprotection." Eur J Pharmacol 406(3): 319-324.

	The present study was undertaken to determine whether 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A)(5-HT1A) receptor agonists interact with voltage-sensitive Na+ or N- and P/Q-type Ca2+ channels to reduce the influx of Na+ and/or Ca2+. The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) inhibited both [H-3]batrachotoxinin binding to neurotoxin site 2 of the Na+ channel in rat cortical membranes (IC50 = 5-1 muM) and veratridine-stimulated Na+ influx into rat synaptosomes (EC50 = 20.8 muM). The 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635) also displaced [H-3]batrachotoxinin binding with similar affinities to 8-OH-DPAT, but were much less effective in reducing veratridine-stimulated Na+ influx. All three serotonergic agents also increased [H-3]saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin site 1 of the Na+ channel. In contrast, none of these agents interacted with radioligand binding to N- or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. These data show that 8-OH-DPAT directly interacts with voltage-sensitive Na+ channels to reduce Na+ influx so providing an additional mechanism to explain how it functions as a neuroprotectant.
