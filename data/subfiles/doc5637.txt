	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasingly prevalent worldwide, causing serious liver complications, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Recent findings suggest that peripheral serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) regulates energy homeostasis, including hepatic lipid metabolism. More specifically, liver-specific 5HT(2A) knockout mice exhibit alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation and hepatic steatosis. Here, structural modifications of pimavanserin (CNS drug), a 5HT(2A) antagonist approved for Parkinson's disease, led us to synthesize new peripherally acting 5HT(2A) antagonists. Among the synthesized compounds, compound 14a showed good in vitro activity, good liver microsomal stability, 5HT subtype selectivity, and no significant inhibition of CYP and hERG. The in vitro and in vivo blood-brain barrier permeability study proved that 14a acts peripherally. Compound 14a decreased the liver weight and hepatic lipid accumulation in high-fat-diet-induced obesity mice. Our study suggests new therapeutic possibilities for peripheral 5HT(2A) antagonists in NAFLD.
