Hayashi, M., et al. (2006). "Alteration of 5-HIAA levels in frontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus in rats treated with combined administration of tryptophan and ethanol." J Toxicol Sci 31(3): 235-246.

	The present studies sought to investigate the effect of tryptophan alone or coadministration of tryptophan and ethanol on the interaction of central frontal cortex and dorsal raphe nucleus serotonergic functional activities by utilizing in vivo microdialysis. Tryptophan (50 mg/kg, i.p.) led to a significant increase in the levels of 5-HIAA, a metabolite of serotonin (5-HT), in the dorsal raphe nucleus, but not in the frontal cortex. Coadministration of tryptophan and ethanol caused very marked increases in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in both the frontal cortex and the dorsal raphe nucleus, although ethanol (1.25 g/kg) did not change 5-HIAA levels in both areas. Moreover, the application of WAY100635 (10 muM), 5-HT(1A) antagonist, into the frontal cortex after coadministration caused a marked increase in 5-HIAA levels in the frontal cortex and a decrease in the levels in the dorsal raphe nucleus, although WAY100635 alone had no effect on these levels. This may suggest that WAY100635-induced increase of 5-HIAA levels in the frontal cortex resulted from negative feedback following the blockade of serotonergic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, and that this increase in 5-HIAA levels decreased 5-HIAA levels in the dorsal raphe nucleus by preventing the activation of dorsal raphe 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors. WAY100635 into the dorsal raphe nucleus did not significantly change 5-HIAA levels in both areas. This may indicate that the blockade of dorsal raphe 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors by WAY100635 resulted in unchanged 5-HIAA levels in the frontal cortex. Behavioral sign of teeth-chattering was markedly observed following the coadministration and in combination with WAY100635. These results may suggest that the increased 5-HIAA levels in both areas after coadministration are indicative of the interrelation via activation of serotonergic neurons, and that the increased levels are partly responsible for behavioral activation of rats.
