Ouach, A., et al. (2019). "Bis(het)aryl-1,2,3-triazole quinuclidines as alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands: Synthesis, structure affinity relationships, agonism activity, F-18 -radiolabeling and PET study in rats." European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 179: 449-469.

	In this paper we describe the design and synthesis of bis(Het)Aryl-1,2,3-triazole quinuclidine alpha 7R ligands using an efficient three-step sequence including a Suzuki-Miyaura cross coupling reaction with commercially available and home-made boron derivatives. The exploration of SAR required the preparation of uncommon boron derivatives. Forty final drugs were tested for their ability to bind the target and nine of them exhibited Ki values below nanomolar concentrations. The best scores were always obtained when the 5-phenyl-2-thiophenyl core was attached to the triazole. The selectivity of these compounds towards the nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 and serotoninergic 5HT3 receptors was assessed and their brain penetration was quantified by the preparation and in vivo evaluation of two [F-18] radiolabelled derivatives. It can be expected from our results that some of these compounds will be suitable for further developments and will have effects on cognitive disorders. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.
