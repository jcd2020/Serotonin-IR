Aulakh, C. S., et al. (1995). "LONG-TERM ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS ALTER 5-HT2A AND 5-HT2C RECEPTOR-MEDIATED HYPERTHERMIA IN FAWN-HOODED RATS." Eur J Pharmacol 282(1-3): 65-70.

	We have recently demonstrated that hyperthermia induced by 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) are separately mediated by selective stimulation of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, respectively in Wistar rats. Furthermore, hyperthermia induced by either DOI or m-CPP was found to be significantly less in Fawn-Hooded rats (a rat strain suggested to represent a genetic model of depression) relative to Wistar rats. In the present study, we studied the effects of long-term antidepressant treatments on DOI (2.5 mg/kg)-induced and m-CPP (2.5 mg/kg)-induced hyperthermia in male Fawn-Hooded rats. Long-term (21 days) treatment with the tricyclic antidepressants, imipramine or clomipramine (each 5 mg/kg/day), attenuated DOI-induced hyperthermia, while m-CPP-induced hyperthermia was accentuated. On the other hand, long-term (21 days) treatment with the monoamine oxidase type-A inhibiting antidepressant, clorgyline (1 mg/kg/day), did not modify m-CPP-induced hyperthermia, but significantly attenuated DOI-induced hyperthermia. These findings demonstrate that long-term antidepressant treatments alter 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor-mediated hyperthermia in a genetic animal model of depression.
