	Present investigation demonstrated the effect of central histaminergic transmission on the compulsive-like marble burying and spontaneous alteration behavior (SAB) in mice. Result demonstrates that on enhancement of endogenous histaminergic transmission in mice achieved by central (i.c.v.) administration of histamine or central histamine neuronal releaser, H-3 receptor antagonist or on intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of histamine precursor, L-histidine significantly attenuated the number of marble buried in marble burying behavior (MBB) test as well as obliterated the persistent behavior induced by 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT in T-Maze test. Furthermore, central injection of histamine H-1 receptor agonist, FMPH or H-2 receptors agonist, amthamine also attenuated the MBB in mice. On the other hand, prior i.c.v administration of H-1 but not H-2 receptor antagonist attenuated the effects exhibited in MBB test on mice by all the above agents capable of enhancing the endogenous central histaminergic transmission. Thus, the results of the present investigation delineate the attenuating effect of central histaminergic transmission predominantly via H-1 receptor on compulsive-like behavior in mice.
