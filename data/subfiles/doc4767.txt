Hook, B. B., et al. (1996). "Derivatives of (R)- and (S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin: Synthesis and interactions with 5-HT1A receptors." Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 39(20): 4036-4043.

	Analogs of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino)tetralin [(S)-1, (S)-UH301] have been prepared. The C8-substituent has been varied, and in some derivatives one of the N-propyl groups has been exchanged for a 4-(8-aza-7,9-dioxospiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)-butyl group. The novel. compounds have been evaluated for affinity to rat brain 5-HT1A receptors in competition experiments with [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT. In addition, the efficacy of the compounds was assessed by their ability to inhibit the VIP-stimulated cAMP formation in GH(4)ZD10 cells expressing rat 5-HT1A receptors. Varying degrees of intrinsic activity was revealed among the compounds tested, i.e., the profiles ranged from full agonists to antagonists. All R-enantiomers are characterized as full agonists at 5-HT1A receptors, whereas partial agonists or antagonists were found among the corresponding S-enantiomers. Substitution of one of the N-propyl groups for a 4-(8-aza-7,9-dioxospiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)butyl group seems to increase efficacy as well as affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. A favorable interaction with an accessory binding site by the N-4-(8-aza-7,9-dioxospiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)butyl group may contribute to the increased affinity.
