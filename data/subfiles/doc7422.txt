Liang, K. C. (1999). "Pre- or post-training injection of buspirone impaired retention in the inhibitory avoidance task: involvement of amygdala 5-HT1A receptors." Eur J Neurosci 11(5): 1491-1500.

	The present study investigated the effect of buspirone on memory formation in an aversive learning task. Male Wistar rats were trained on the inhibitory avoidance task and tested for retention 1 day after training. They received peripheral or intra-amygdala administration of buspirone or other 5-HT1A drugs either before or after training. Results indicated that pretraining systemic injections of buspirone caused a dose-dependent retention deficit; 5. 0 mg/kg had a marked effect and 1.0 mg/kg had no effect. Post-training injections of the drug caused a time-dependent retention deficit, which was not due to a state-dependent effect on retrieval. When training in the inhibitory avoidance task was divided into a context-training phase and a shock-training phase, buspirone impaired retention only when administered in the shock-training phase, suggesting that the drug influenced memory processing of affective events. Further results indicated that post-training intra-amygdala infusion of buspirone or the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-di-n-propylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) caused a time-dependent and dose-dependent retention deficit. Post-training intra-amygdala infusion of the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 (N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane carboxamine maleate) attenuated the memory-impairing effects of buspirone. These findings suggest that buspirone may modulate memory storage processes in the inhibitory avoidance task through an action on amygdaloid 5-HT1A receptors.
