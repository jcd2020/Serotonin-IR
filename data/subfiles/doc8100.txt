	Dehydrozingerone (DHZ) is a phenolic compound isolated from ginger rhizomes (Zingiber officinale). It is known for its diverse spectrum of biological activities as an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and antitumor compound. The present study was designed to assess the antidepressant effect of DHZ and the involvement of the monoaminergic system and to evaluate its in vitro antioxidant activity in the hippocampus, cortex and cerebellum of mice. For this study, the tail suspension test (TST), forced swim test (FST) and yohimbine lethality test were performed. DHZ administered orally 30min prior to testing reduced the immobility time in the TST (1-40mg/kg) and the FST (10-40mg/kg), with no change in locomotor activity in the open field test. The antidepressant-like effect of DHZ (1mg/kg) was prevented by ketanserin (1mg/kg, i.p.; a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist), ondansetron (1mg/kg, i.p.; a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist), prazosin (1mg/kg, i.p., an alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist) and yohimbine (1mg/kg, i.p., an alpha2-adrenoceptor antagonist) pretreatments. Furthermore, DHZ administered at doses of 10 and 20mg/kg increased the lethality of yohimbine (35mg/kg, i.p.). DHZ had antioxidant activity on in vitro lipid peroxidation induced by sodium nitroprusside in all brain regions tested. The results revealed that DHZ has a potent antidepressant effect, which seems to involve the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems.
