"4-(2'-METHOXY-PHENYL)-1- 2'-(N-2''-PYRIDINYL)-P-IODOBENZAMIDO ETHYL-PIPE RAZINE ( I-125 P-MPPI) AS A NEW SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND OF SEROTONIN-1A SITES IN RAT-BRAIN - IN-VITRO BINDING AND AUTORADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES."

	Binding characteristics of a radioiodinated serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor antagonist, 4-(2'-methoxy-phenyl)-1-[2'-(n-2''-pyridinyl)-p-iodobenzamido]-ethyl-piperazine ([I-125]p-MPPI) were evaluated using in vitro homogenate binding and autoradiographic techniques in rat brains. [I-125]p-MPPI displayed a K-d value of 0.32 +/- 0.04 nM (in the presence of MgCl2) and a B-max value of 315 +/- 60 fmol/mg of protein in rat hippocampal homogenates. The number of 5-HT1A receptors labeled by [I-125]p-MPPI was 40% higher than that labeled by trans-8-hydroxy-2-(N-n-propyl-N-3'-iodo-2'-propenyl)aminotetralin ([I-125]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT) (225 +/- 47 fmol/mg of protein), a radioiodinated 5-HT1A agonist. The magnesium ion showed an inhibitory effect on [I-125]p-MPPI binding but increased the specific binding of [I-125]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT. A significant increase in B-max values in the presence of guanyl nucleotides was observed for [I-125]p-MPPI (control, 307 +/- 35 fmol/mg of protein; with GTP, 345 +/- 30 fmol/mg of protein; with guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, 362 +/- 35 fmol/mg of protein); however, both guanyl nucleotides significantly reduced the B-max values measured by [I-125]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT (control, 213 +/- 50 fmol/mg of protein; with GTP, 133 +/- 20 fmol/mg of protein; with guanylyl-imidodiphosphate, 108 +/- 20 fmol/mg of protein). The binding characteristics of [I-125]p-MPPI for 5-HT1A receptors suggest that p-MPPI is an antagonist for 5-HT1A receptors. In vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain sections with [I-125]p-MPPI showed specific labeling of areas rich in 5-HT1A receptors and the regional distribution closely matched those labeled by [I-125]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT. This novel radioiodinated compound, [I-125]p-MPPI, is the first selective 5-HT1A receptor ligand reported in the literature. Together with the agonist radioligand, [I-125]R(+)8-OH-PIPAT, these two ligands may provide useful tools for studies of 5-HT1A receptors in the central nervous system.
