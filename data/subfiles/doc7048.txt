	It was previously suggested that exposure to magnetic fields (MFs) could generate dysfunction of the CNS. The physiological manifestations described lead us to postulate that these symptoms might be related to a dysfunction of the serotonergic system and particularly of the 5-HT1B receptors. Accordingly, MFs could modify the conformation of these receptors altering their functional activities. In rat brain membrane preparations, we showed that the affinity constant of 5-HT for 5-HT1B receptors was modified under exposure to MFs since K-d varied from 4.7 +/- 0.5 to 12 +/- 3 nhl in control and exposed (2.5 mT) membranes, respectively. This effect was intensity-dependent (the sigmoidal dose-response curve was characterized by an EI50 of 662 +/- 69 mu T and a maximal increase of 321 +/- 13% of the control K-d), reversible, temperature-dependent and specific to the 5-HT1B receptors. Similar results have also been obtained with the human 5-HT1B receptors. In parallel assays, the functional activity of 5-HT1B receptors was investigated. The capacity of a 5-HT1B agonist to inhibit the cAMP production was reduced by 37% (53.7 +/- 3.5% to 33.7 +/- 4.1%) following exposure to MFs and the cellular activity of the receptors (inhibition of the synaptosomal release of 5-HT) also was markedly reduced (66.5 +/- 3.2% to 28.5 +/- 4.2%). These results clearly show that in in vitro assays, MF specifically interacts with 5-HT1B receptors, inducing structural changes of the protein that result in a functional desensitization of the receptors. Thus, in vivo, exposure to MFs may lead to physiological changes, particularly in the field of mood disorders where the 5-HT system is strongly involved. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.
