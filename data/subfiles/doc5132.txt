	Serotonin (5-hydroxytrytamine (5-HT)) plays an important role in experimental seizures. Recently, we reported the depletion of 5-HT by parachlorophynylalanine (PCPA) in whole brain to enhance 6-Hz psychomotor seizures in mice. In the present work, we investigated the effect of 5-HT depletion in cortex and hippocampus, brain regions relevant for epilepsy, on behavioral and ultra-structural changes following 6-Hz psychomotor seizures in mice. In addition, we studied the effect of sodium valproate (SVP) on behavioral, biochemical, and ultra-structural effects induced by 6 Hz. Behavioral changes induced by 6 Hz stimulation were characterized as the increased duration of Straub's tail, stun position, twitching of vibrissae, forelimb clonus, and increased rearing and grooming. PCPA administration further enhanced while SVP reduced these behaviors in mice. The 6-Hz psychomotor seizure induced ultra-structural changes in both cortex and hippocampus in mice treated with PCPA. Furthermore, PCPA administrations followed by 6Hz-induced seizures were accompanied by reduced hippocampal and cortical 5-HT. SVP attenuated the PCPA-induced ultra-structural changes and alterations of 5-HT content in the mouse brain. The study suggests the involvement of 5-HT in the 6 Hz psychomotor seizures and in the mechanisms of action of SVP against such seizures in mice.
