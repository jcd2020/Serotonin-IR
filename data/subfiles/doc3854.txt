	Hypercortisolism and altered serotonergic function may account for the pathological symptoms seen in depression. This study examines the impact of 4 days continuous corticosterone treatment on 5-HT agonist-induced behaviour to delineate changes in 5-HT receptor function in the adult rat. The flat body posture, reciprocal forepaw treading, elevated corticosterone, hyperglycaemia, hypothermia and reduced hippocampal 5-HT induced by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OHDPAT (0.3 mg/kg ip) were all significantly attenuated by the corticosterone implant. The elevation in plasma corticosterone and back muscle contractions evoked by the 5-HT2A agonist DOI (1 mg/kg ip) were attenuated, whilst wet-dog shakes were enhanced by corticosterone treatment. 5-HT2B agonist-induced behaviour and the hypolocomotion and hypophagia induced by the 5-HT2C agonist m-CPP (2.5 mg/kg ip) were unaltered but the mCPP-induced elevation in corticosterone was abolished by corticosterone treatment, Hypothalamic 5-HT receptors mediating corticosterone- and 5-HT1A receptors, whether on serotonergic nerve terminals or postsynaptic neurones, were downregulated by corticosterone treatment. In contrast, 5-HT2A receptors may be up- or downregulated dependent on whether they are on supraspinal or spinal neurones, respectively. A comparison of the brain region-dependent alteration in serotonergic function produced by hypercorticosterone in the rat with that seen in depression is discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.
