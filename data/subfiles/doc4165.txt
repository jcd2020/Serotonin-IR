Gargiulo, P. A., et al. (1996). "Effects of anxiety and memory of systemic and intra-amygdala injection of 5-HT3 receptor antagonist BRL 46470A." Neuropsychobiology 33(4): 189-195.

	This study deals with the effects of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, BRL 46470A, on memory and anxiety, using the elevated T-maze. This method is useful for investigating the effects of anxiolytic drugs on memory, and the relationships between neural subsystems involved in emotionally related behaviors and in processes underlying learning. After the drug was either injected peripherally or microinjected into the amygdala, the animals were tested on the elevated T-maze (30 or 15 min later, respectively). Two kinds of aversively motivated behaviors, inhibitory avoidance and one-way escape, were recorded. These behaviors may reflect different types of fear/anxiety, namely, anticipatory anxiety and innate fear. Three days later, memory for these tasks was assessed by reexposing the subjects to the maze. The compound had an anxiolytic effect on the inhibitory avoidance response when given systemically, but an anxiogenic effect when injected into the amygdala. It had an anxiolytic action on the escape response when given either systemically or into the amygdala. The compound had no adverse effects on memory for either task. These results suggest that this new 5-HT3 antagonist may be useful in the treatment of certain types of anxiety disorders, especially those related to unconditioned fear, e.g. phobic or panic disorders, with the likelihood of having no side effects on memory processes. The contrasting results obtained with different measures of anxiety may also account for the inconsistencies found in the experimental literature dealing with compounds of this nature.
