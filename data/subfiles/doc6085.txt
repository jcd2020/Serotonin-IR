	Starting from the lead structure of ketanserin, a prototypic serotonin (5-HT) antagonist, new oxotechnetium(V) and oxorhenium(V) complexes were synthesized that are able to compete with [3H]ketan-serin in receptor-binding assays. To imitate organic 5-HT2 receptor ligands, fragments of ketanserin were combined with chelate moieties. Neutral compounds of the general formula [MOL1L2] (M = Tc, Re; L1 = HS-CH2CH2-S-CH2CH2-SH, N-(2-mercaptophenyl)salicylideneimine, N-(2-mercaptoethyl)-salicylideneimine, 3-(2-([N,N-bis(2-mercapto-S-ethyl)]-amino)ethyl)-2,4-(1H, 3H)-quinazolinedione and L2 = HS-R with R = subst. alkyl) were prepared by common action of a Tc(V) or Re(V) precursor with a mixture of equimolar amounts of a tridentate ligand L1 and a monodentate thiolate L2 bearing fragments of the lead structure. Lipophilic complexes consisting of a small S4 thiolate/thioether chelate unit, protonable nitrogen-containing spacer, and simple benzyl moiety significantly inhibited the specific binding of [3H]ketan-serin with IC50 values between 10 and 50 nM.
