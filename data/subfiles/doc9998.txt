Pecotic, R., et al. (2009). "BLOCKADE OF 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN THE PHRENIC NUCLEUS OF THE RAT ATTENUATED RAPHE INDUCED ACTIVATION OF THE PHRENIC NERVE ACTIVITY." Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 60(3): 167-172.

	Stimulation of the raphe pallidus nucleus produces facilitatory effects on respiratory activity. Numerous serotonergic projections from the raphe pallidus have been shown to terminate in the phrenic nucleus. This study was undertaken to examine the role of 5-hydroxytryptamine 1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the phrenic nucleus on the excitatory response of the phrenic nerve activity elicited from the raphe pallidus. We hypothesized that blockade of 5-HT1A receptors in the phrenic nucleus will attenuate raphe-induced facilitation of the phrenic nerve. Chemical stimulation of the raphe pallidus by synaptic excitant D,L-homocysteic acid produced increase in the amplitude of the phrenic nerve activity. After microinjection of the specific 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY, N-(2-(4,2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-2-pyridinyl-cyclohexane-carboxamide maleate into the phrenic nucleus, the raphe-induced facilitation of the phrenic nerve was attenuated. These data suggest that excitation of the phrenic nerve activity elicited by activation of the neurons in the raphe pallidus is mediated by 5-HT1A receptors in the phrenic nucleus.
