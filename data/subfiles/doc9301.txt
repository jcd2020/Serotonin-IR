Rayevsky, K. S., et al. (2012). "Effect of Combined Administration of Afobazole and 5-HT2b/2c Receptor Antagonist SB-200646A on Neurochemical Profile of Brain Structures in C57Bl/6 and BALB/c Mice." Bulletin of Experimental Biology and Medicine 153(5): 689-693.

	The effects of combined administration of afobazole and 5-DeD cent(2b/2c) receptor antagonist SB-200646A on the content of monoamines and their metabolites in brain structures of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice were studied by the methods of HPLC with electrochemical detection. Combined administration of afobazole and SB-200646A increased the content of epinephrine in the striatum of BALB/c mice (to 230% of the control) and in the hippocampus of both mouse strains. The content of dihydroxyphenylacetic and homovanillic acids and parameters of dopamine metabolism in these structures were reduced. The content of dopamine in the hypothalamus and amygdala was elevated in C57Bl/6, but not in BALB/c mice. These fi ndings attest to the involvement of monoamine systems of the brain in the mechanism of afobazole action and suggest that the enhanced anxiolytic effect of afobazole combination with SB-200646A can be interpreted as a positive modulation of the effect of anxiolytic determined by blockade of 5-DeD cent(2) serotonin receptors.
