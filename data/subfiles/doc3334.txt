	1. The effect of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) on the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in rat visual cortex was investigated by using slice preparations in vitro. 2. Bath application of 5-HT (0.1-10 microM) did not affect the baseline synaptic potentials evoked by single-pulse test stimulation, but inhibited the induction of LTP in a concentration-dependent manner. 3. The effect of 5-HT was blocked by the 5-HT1 receptor antagonist pindolol or the 5-HT2,7 receptor antagonist ritanserin, but not by the 5-HT3,4 receptor antagonist MDL72222. 4. These results suggest that 5-HT plays a role in suppressing the induction of LTP in the rat visual cortex.
