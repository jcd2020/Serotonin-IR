Millan, M. J., et al. (1998). "WAY 100,635 enhances both the 'antidepressant' actions of duloxetine and its influence on dialysate levels of serotonin in frontal cortex." Eur J Pharmacol 341(2-3): 165-167.

	The mixed serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, duloxetine, (5.0 mg/kg, s.c.), increased levels of serotonin (220%), dopamine (180%) and noradrenaline (470%) in individual dialysates of frontal cortex of freely moving rats. Its influence on serotonin, but not dopamine or noradrenaline, levels was enhanced by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100,635 (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclo-hexanecarboxamide 3HCl) (0.16 mg kg(-1), s.c). In the forced swimming test, although duloxetine was inactive alone, it dose dependently reduced immobility in the presence of WAY 100,635. Thus, blockade of 5-HT1A (auto)receptors selectively facilitates the influence of duloxetine on serotonin levels in the frontal cortex in rats and, in the forced swimming model, enhances its 'antidepressant' properties in parallel.
