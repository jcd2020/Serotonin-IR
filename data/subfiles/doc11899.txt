Wong, E. H., et al. (1996). "Characterization of [3H]GR 113808 binding to 5-HT4 receptors in brain tissues from patients with neurodegenerative disorders." Behav Brain Res 73(1-2): 249-252.

	[3H]GR 113808 binding studies in guinea-pig brain tissue revealed a temperature dependency and pharmacological specificity consistent with labelling of a 5-HT4 receptor. Detailed comparison of competition data between brain regions from human and guinea-pig suggest minor differences in the rank order of affinity. Studies in brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer's Huntington's and Parkinson's disease have revealed specific deficits in 5-HT4 receptor densities.
