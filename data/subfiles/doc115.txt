Ahlgren, C., et al. (2004). "In vitro characterization of AR-A000002, a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) autoreceptor antagonist." Eur J Pharmacol 499(1-2): 67-75.

	The in vitro pharmacological properties of AR-A000002 ((R)-N-[5-methyl-8-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-naphthyl]-4-morp holinobenzamide), a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1B) receptor antagonist, were studied. AR-A000002 bound with high affinity to guinea pig cortex and recombinant guinea pig 5-HT(1B) receptors (Ki=0.24 and 0.47 nM) and with 10-fold lower affinity to 5-HT(1D) receptors. The compound displayed weak or no affinity for 63 other binding sites tested. In [35S]GTPgammaS assays AR-A000002 showed 50% efficacy and inhibited 5-HT stimulation with 66% and a pA2 value of 8.9. In slices of guinea pig cortex, AR-A000002 enhanced the outflow of [3H]5-HT upon electrical stimulation. The compound blocked sumatriptan-evoked contraction of rabbit saphenous veins without inducing any contraction itself. Thus, in these two systems AR-A000002 behaved as a 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist. It is concluded that AR-A000002 is a selective high affinity 5HT(1B) receptor ligand that shows partial agonist activity in recombinant systems. In native tissues AR-A000002 behaves as a 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist.
