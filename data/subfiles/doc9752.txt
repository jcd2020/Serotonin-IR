Orjales, A., et al. (1997). "New 2-piperazinylbenzimidazole derivatives as 5-HT3 antagonists. Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation." J Med Chem 40(4): 586-593.

	A series of 2-piperazinylbenzimidazole derivatives were prepared and evaluated as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Their 5-HT3 receptor affinities were evaluated by radioligand binding assays, and their abilities to inhibit the 5-HT-induced Bezold-Jarisch reflex in anesthetized rats were determined. Compound 7e (lerisetron, pK(i) = 9.2) exhibited higher affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor than did tropisetron and granisetron, while compound 7q (pK(i) 7.5) had very low affinity for this receptor, showing that substitution on the N-1 atom of the benzimidazole ring is essential for affinity and activity. The effect of substitution on the aromatic ring of benzimidazole by several substituents in different positions is also discussed. A strong correlation between the 5-HT3 antagonistic activity of the studied compounds and the position of substitution on the aromatic ring was established. Thus, while the 4-methoxy derivative 7m showed weak affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor (pK(i) = 6.7), the 7-methoxy derivative 7n exhibited the highest affinity (pK(i) = 9.4). Compounds 7e and 7n are now under further investigation as drugs for the treatment of nausea and emesis evoked by cancer chemotherapy and radiation.
