Franchini, S., et al. (2018). "Synthesis and biological evaluation of 1,3-dioxolane-based 5-HT1A receptor agonists for CNS disorders and neuropathic pain." Future Medicinal Chemistry 10(18): 2137-2154.

	Aim: Targeting 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR) as a strategy for CNS disorders and pain control. Methodology: A series of 1,3-dioxolane-based 2-heteroaryl-phenoxyethylamines was synthesized by a convergent approach and evaluated at alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and 5-HT1AR by binding and functional experiments. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity prediction studies were performed to explore the drug-likeness of the compounds. Results & conclusion: The most promising compound, the pyridin-4-yl derivative, emerged as a potent and selective 5-HT1AR agonist (pKi = 9.2; pD2 = 8.83; 5-HT1A/alpha 1 = 135). in vitro it was able to permeate by passive diffusion MDCKII-MDR1 monolayer mimicking the blood-brain barrier and showed promising neuroprotective activity.
