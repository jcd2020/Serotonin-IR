	In vitro studies have shown that 5-HT2 receptors can be coupled via G-proteins to phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activation, releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. To examine this signaling pathway in brain, we developed an in vivo method to image regional brain PLA(2) activation in unanesthetized rats given different types of serotonergic drugs. Increased arachidonate incorporation from plasma, in response to drug-induced PLA(2)-activation, can be quantified with autoradiography, following the intravenous injection of radiolabeled arachidonate. For example, a 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist, (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl-2-aminopropane, produced widespread increases in incorporation of labeled arachidonate by directly binding to 5-HT2A/2C receptors. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selectively increased incorporation of arachidonic acid by increasing 5-HT availability in the synaptic cleft and thus indirectly activating phospholipase A(2) The detailed method is described.
