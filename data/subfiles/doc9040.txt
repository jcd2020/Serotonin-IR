	We have developed F-18-trans-Mefway (F-18-Mefway) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors which are implicated in various brain functions. Translation of imaging the 5-HT1A receptor in animal models to humans will facilitate an understanding of the role of the receptor in human brain disorders. We report comparative brain distribution of F-18-Mefway in normal mice, rats, monkeys, and healthy human volunteers. Mefway was found to be very selective, with subnanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor. Affinities of >55nM were found for all other human-cloned receptor subtypes tested. Mefway was found to be a poor substrate (>30M) for the multidrug resistance 1 protein, suggesting low likelihood of brain uptake being affected by P-glycoprotein. Cerebellum was used as a reference region in all imaging studies across all species due to the low levels of F-18-Mefway binding. Consistent binding of F-18-Mefway in cortical regions, hippocampus, and raphe was observed across all species. F-18-Mefway in the human brain regions correlated with the known postmortem distribution of 5-HT1A receptors. Quantitation of raphe was affected by the resolution of the PET scanners in rodents, whereas monkeys and humans showed a raphe to cerebellum ratio of approximately 3. F-18-Mefway appears to be an effective 5-HT1A receptor imaging agent in all models, including humans. F-18-Mefway therefore may be used to quantify 5-HT1A receptor distribution in brain regions for the study of various CNS disorders. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
