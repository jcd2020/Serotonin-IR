Leishman, D. J., et al. (1994). "DIFFERENTIAL-EFFECTS OF CENTRALLY-ACTIVE ANTIHYPERTENSIVES ON 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN RAT DORSOLATERAL SEPTUM, RAT HIPPOCAMPUS AND GUINEA-PIG HIPPOCAMPUS." British Journal of Pharmacology 111(1): 318-324.

	1 The electrophysiological responses elicited by 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A)- (5-HT1A) receptor agonists in rat and guinea-pig CA1 pyramidal neurones and rat dorso-lateral septal neurones were compared in vitro by use of conventional intracellular recording techniques. 2 In the presence of 1 mu M tetrodotoxin (TTX), to prevent indirect effects, 5-HT, N,N-dipropyl-5-carboxamidotryptamine (DP-5-CT) and 8-hydroxy-2(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) hyperpolarized the neurones from rat and guinea-pig brain. 3 The hypotensive drug flesinoxan, a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist, hyperpolarized neurones in all three areas tested; however, another hypotensive agent with high affinity at 5-HT1A-receptors, 5-methyl-urapidil, hyperpolarized only the neurones in rat hippocampus and septum. 4 In guinea-pig hippocampal neurones, 5-methyl-urapidil behaved as a 5-HT(1)A-receptor antagonist. 5 The relative efficacies (5-HT = 1) of DP-5-CT, 8-OH-DPAT, flesinoxan and 5-methyl-urapidil at the three sites were: rat hippocampus, 1.09, 0.7, 0.5 and 0.24; rat septum, 0.88, 0.69, 0.82 and 0.7; guinea-pig hippocampus, 1.0, 0.69, 0.89 and 0, respectively. 6 It is concluded that the hypotensive agents flesinoxan and 5-methyl-urapidil appear to have different efficacies at 5-HT1A receptors located in different regions of the rodent brain. Whether these regional and species differences arise from receptor plurality or variability in intracellular transduction mechanisms remains to be elucidated.
