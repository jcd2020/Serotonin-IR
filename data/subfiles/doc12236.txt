	The present study examined whether the effect of stimulation of the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) is mediated by spinal cord dorsal horn serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptors in the rat. This hypothesis predicts that nociceptive dorsal horn units inhibited by NRM stimulation or iontophoretic 5-HT application would also be inhibited by iontophoresis of the selective 5-HT1A agonists 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and buspirone. A total of 78 dorsal horn wide-dynamic-range neurons were recorded. Overall, 62% of the cells tested (48/78) were responsive to electrical stimulation of the NRM with the predominant response being inhibitory (38/48; 79%). Fifty-eight cells were tested for their response to both NRM stimulation and 8-OH-DPAT iontophoresis: 20/58 cells were inhibited by NRM stimulation and 50% of the cells inhibited by NRM stimulation were also inhibited by 8-OH-DPAT. Fifty-two cells were tested for their response to both NRM stimulation and buspirone iontophoresis: 14/52 cells were inhibited by NRM stimulation with 9/14 similarly inhibited by buspirone. To examine whether exogenously applied serotonin produced an effect through 5-HT1A receptors, the effect of both 5-HT and 8-OH-DPAT iontophoresis was tested on 57 dorsal horn neurons. The majority of cells (25/57) were inhibited by 5-HT application; 15/25 were similarly inhibited by 8-OH-DPAT. The response of 48 dorsal horn cells to 5-HT and buspirone iontophoresis was compared. Forty-four percent (21/48) of the cells were inhibited by 5-HT; 16/21 were also inhibited by buspirone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
