Ghavami, A., et al. (1997). "Adenovirus-mediated expression of 5-HT1B receptors in cardiac ventricle myocytes; coupling to inwardly rectifying K+ channels." Eur J Pharmacol 340(2-3): 259-266.

	The 5-HT1B receptor is expressed on nerve terminals where it inhibits neurotransmitter release. When expressed ectopically in fibroblasts, the 5-HT1B receptor inhibits adenylyl cyclase. However, in the central nervous system, the effect of this receptor on neurotransmitter release appears to be cAMP-independent. We therefore investigated alternative effector systems that might be activated by the 5-HT1B receptor. We constructed a recombinant adenovirus that allows expression of high levels of the 5-HT1B receptor in a variety of cells. We chose cardiac ventricle myocytes because they express a muscarinic-gated, inwardly rectifying K+ channel (i(KACh)). In infected ventricle cells, both 5-HT and the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, elicited a similar inwardly rectifying K+ current. The currents elicited by these agonists were pertussis-toxin sensitive and were not additive. These results suggest a common signal transduction pathway for 5-HT1B and muscarinic receptors in ventricle cells. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.
