McBean, D. E., et al. (1991). "Cerebrovascular and functional consequences of 5-HT1A receptor activation." Brain Res 555(1): 159-163.

	Cerebral glucose utilization and blood flow were measured in rats using 2-deoxy-D-[14C]glucose and [14C]iodoantipyrine quantitative autoradiography, respectively, following treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). In control and 8-OH-DPAT-treated animals blood flow and glucose use were similarly correlated, but the ratio was increased following 8-OH-DPAT treatment. Since 5-HT1A receptor activation is known to reduce neuronal 5-HT release, these results are consistent with a vasoconstrictor role for endogenous serotonin.
