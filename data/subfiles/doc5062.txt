	Serotonin (5-HT) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system, including several areas involved in the control of micturition reflex pathways. However, the roles of the different subtypes of 5-HT receptors are not well known. We studied in normal, conscious rats, the effects on the cystometrogram of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 5-HT, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylaminotetralin) (8-OH-DPAT; agonist at 5-HT1A receptors), alpha-methol-5-hydroxytryptamine maleate (agonist at 5-HT2 receptors), 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (agonist at 5-HT3 receptors), and 1-(4-amino-5-chloro-2methoxyphenyl)-3-(1-n-butyl-4piperidinyl)-1-propanone hydrochloride (RS67506; agonist at 5-HT4 receptors). Female Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing approximately 230 g, were used. A polyethylene catheter was inserted into the bladder through the dome for cystometric investigations. For administration of drugs, a catheter was implanted into the right cerebral ventricle. Three days after implantation of the bladder catheter, continuous cystometry was performed. Administration of 5-HT (6 nmol/kg i.c.v.), 8-OH-DPAT (6 nmol/kg), alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine maleate (6 nmol/kg), or RS67506 hydrochloride (6 nmol/kg) significantly (P < 0.05) increased micturition pressure and decreased bladder capacity and micturition volume. The effects increased in a dose-dependent manner (18, 60 nmol/kg). Intracerebroventricular administration of 2-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine hydrochloride (60 nmol/kg) caused no change in the cystometric parameters. The results suggest that in normal conscious rats, at the supraspinal level, 5-HT (via 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, and 5-HT4 receptors) can enhance the micturition reflex induced by bladder filling. Whether this means that 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, and 5-HT4 receptors can be targets for drugs meant for treatment of bladder hyperactivity, should be explored. (C) 2002Wiley-Liss, Inc.
