Le Poul, E., et al. (2000). "Differential adaptation of brain 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors and 5-HT transporter in rats treated chronically with fluoxetine." Neuropharmacology 39(1): 110-122.

	Quantification of receptor binding sites and their encoding mRNAs, and electrophysiological recordings, were used to assess central serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission in rats 24 h after a 2-3 week treatment with the selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine (8 mg/kg i.p., daily). Binding studies showed that this treatment affected neither 5-HT1A nor 5-HT1B binding sites in all brain areas examined. However, a significant decrease (-38%) in 5-HT1A mRNA levels in the anterior raphe area (but not forebrain regions) and increases in 5-HT1A mRNA levels in the striatum (+127%) and the cerebral cortex (+34%) were noted in fluoxetine-treated rats. Electrophysiological recordings in brain slices showed that chronic fluoxetine treatment reduced the potency of the 5HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyramino)tetralin to inhibit neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus, but did not affect 5HT(1A)-evoked responses of CA1 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus. These data further demonstrate that fluoxetine-induced adaptive changes in 5-HT neurotransmission exhibit marked regional differences. The decrease in 5-HT1A mRNA levels in the anterior raphe suggests that fluoxetine-induced desensitization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors involves changes at the transcription level.
