	Prior behavioral history in operant conditioning paradigms may induce impulsive-like responding as shown in rats. Little is known to what extent behavioral history influences subsequent behavior in mice, therefore the present study investigated the effects of lever-pressing under a fixed-ratio 5 schedule of reinforcement on subsequent differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate (DRL) 36 s performance in wild type mice compared to the behavior of 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice. Acquisition of both autoshaping and fixed-ratio 5 training was faster in 5-HT1B receptor knockout compared to wild type mice. Nevertheless, in the DRL 36 s procedure no differences were observed between genotypes. Both wild type and 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice displayed premature or impulsive-like responding in the DRL 36 s procedure, for example a peak location of responses around 20 s and high rates of responding. Taken together, the present data suggest that impulsive-like responding in the DRL 36 s procedure in mice depends on prior behavioral history.
