	This study examined the time course and possible mechanisms of agonist-induced desensitization of 5-hydroxytryptamine serotonin 2A receptors in the rat frontal cortex and hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus after 1, 4, and 7 days of treatment with (-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)2-aminopropane HCl [(-)-DOI] (1 mg/kg i.p.), a selective 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor agonist. In the frontal cortex, 5-HT-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme activity decreased by 24 to 30% after 4 to 7 days of (-)-DOI treatment without any significant changes in the guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-mediated PLC enzyme activity. Additionally, treatment with (-)-DOI did not significantly change the levels of G(alpha11), regulator of G protein signaling (RGS)4, or RGS7 proteins in the frontal cortex, whereas G(alphaq) protein levels in the frontal cortex decreased (47%) only after 7 daily (-)-DOI injections. The functional status of 5-HT(2A) receptors in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus was examined using 5-HT(2A) receptor-mediated increases in plasma hormone levels. Plasma adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and oxytocin measurements showed that 5-HT(2A) receptor desensitization began after only 1 day of (-)-DOI treatment, and the desensitization continued to increase after 4 and 7 days of treatment (ACTH response decreased 64.2-67.7%; oxytocin response decreased 82.3-90.1%). There were no significant alterations in levels of G(alphaq) or G(alpha11) lamic paraventricular proteins in the hypothanucleus. In conclusion, these results suggest that chronically administered (-)-DOI induces desensitization of 5-HT(2A) receptors in vivo, via a reduction in the ability of 5-HT(2A) receptors to activate G proteins without consistently altering levels of G(alpha) proteins or RGS proteins.
