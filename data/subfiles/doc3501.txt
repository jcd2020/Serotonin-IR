Fujio, M., et al. (2000). "N-[[1-(2-phenylethyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl]methyl]cyclohexanecarboxamides as selective 5-HT1A receptor agonists." Bioorg Med Chem Lett 10(5): 509-512.

	A series of benzamides was synthesized as selective agonists for the 5-HT1A receptor. It was found that (S)-N-[[1-(2-phenylethyl)pyrrolidin-2-yl]methyl]cyclohexanecarb oxamide(7-(S)) has potent and selective agonistic activity for the 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1A; Ki 0.49 nmol/L, D2; IC50 = >1000 nmol/L, 5-HT2; Ki = 240 nmol/L).
