Battagli, G., et al. (2000). "Prenatal cocaine exposure potentiates 5-HT2A receptor function in male and female rat offspring." Synapse 35(3): 163-172.

	We have reported previously prenatal cocaine-induced functional deficits in serotonergic terminals, and gender-specific supersensitivity of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor-mediated hormone responses in offspring. This study investigates the effects of prenatal exposure to cocaine on postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor-mediated responses in prepubescent male and female offspring. Pregnant rats were administered saline or (-)cocaine (15 mg/kg, s.c., b.i.d) from gestational day 13 through 20. Changes in 5-HT2A receptor function in offspring were assessed by differences in the ability of DOI [4-iodo, 2,5-dimethoxyphenyl-isopropylamine; 2.0 mg/kg, s.c.] to elevate plasma levels of the hormones ACTH, corticosterone and renin. Basal hormone levels in male and female progeny were unaffected by prenatal cocaine exposure. However, prenatal exposure to cocaine significantly potentiated the magnitude of the ACTH response to DOI in both male ( + 19%) and female ( + 43%) progeny. Similarly, the DOI-induced elevation of plasma renin was markedly potentiated in male (+ 51%) and female (+ 83%) cocaine-exposed offspring. Although DOI significantly elevated corticosterone levels in both male and female offspring, the magnitude of corticosterone responses was not altered by prenatal exposure to cocaine. Densities of agonist (I-125-DOI)-labeled receptors in hypothalamus and cortex were unaltered by prenatal exposure to cocaine. These data indicate prenatal cocaine-induced supersensitivity of postsynaptic 5-HT2A receptor function in male and female offspring without changes in receptor density. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
