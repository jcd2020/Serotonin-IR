L'Estrade, E. T., et al. (2019). "Synthesis, Radiolabeling, and in Vitro and in Vivo Evaluation of F-18 ENL30: A Potential PET Radiotracer for the 5-HT7 Receptor." Acs Omega 4(4): 7344-7353.

	The 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) is involved in a broad range of physiological conditions and disorders. Currently, there is no validated clinical positron emission tomography (PET) tracer available; however, we have recently developed a promising C-11-labeled candidate. In this project, we aimed to further extend our efforts and develop an F-18-labeled derivative, coined [F-18]ENL30. Fluorine-18 has several advantages over carbon-11 especially within the preclinical phase, where a long half-life usually increases evaluation throughput. ENL30 was successfully synthesized in a low albeit sufficient overall yield. Radiolabeling succeeded with a radiochemical yield of approximately 4.5%. Subsequent preclinical PET studies revealed that [F-18]ENL30 binds specifically to the 5-HT7R but suffered from affinity to sigma-receptors. Additionally, we identified [F-18]ENL30 to be a P-gp substrate in rats. However, we believe that [F-18]ENL30 may prove to be valuable in higher species that exhibit decreased P-gp dependency. If required, sigma-receptor binding could, in such studies, be selectively blocked potentially allowing for selective 5-HT7R imaging.
