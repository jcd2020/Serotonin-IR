He, L., et al. (2003). "5-HT2 and 3 receptor antagonists suppress the response of rat type I slowly adapting mechanoreceptor: an in vitro study." Brain Res 969(1-2): 230-236.

	Previous experiments have shown an increase in rat type I mechanoreceptor responsiveness during arterial serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) infusion and the presence of serotonin immunostaining in Merkel cells. The current findings demonstrate that the 5-HT(2) antagonists ritanserin and ketanserin, as well as the 5-HT(3) antagonist MDL 72222, reduce type I response to a standardized mechanical stimulus in an in vitro skin preparation. In addition, ritanserin blocked the enhancement of type I response produced by 5-HT. These experiments suggest that serotonin is released during mechanical distortion of the Merkel cell membrane and alters action potential generation by the type I ending. In addition, it is possible that serotonin, released from outside the type I complex, influences mechanoreceptor responsiveness. For example, serotonin generated during inflammatory events could enhance type I response to mechanical stimulation and thereby increase symptoms of mechanical allodynia.
