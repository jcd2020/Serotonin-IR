Marek, G. J. and G. K. Aghajanian (1999). "5-HT2A receptor or alpha(1)-adrenoceptor activation induces excitatory postsynaptic currents in layer V pyramidal cells of the medial prefrontal cortex." European Journal of Pharmacology 367(2-3): 197-206.

	We compared 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), norepinephrine and dopamine for their efficacy at increasing excitatory postsynaptic current frequency in layer V pyramidal cells from rat medial prefrontal cortical slices. 5-HT, norepinephrine and dopamine increased the excitatory postsynaptic current frequency by 15.9-, 4.5- and 1.7-fold, respectively. Similar to previous results with 5-HT-induced excitatory postsynaptic currents, blockade of mu-opioid receptors, of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors and fast Na+ channels suppressed the norepinephrine-induced excitatory postsynaptic currents. The norepinephrine-induced, and in most cases, the dopamine-induced increase in excitatory postsynaptic current frequency was blocked by the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin while the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine did not block either the norepinephrine- or the 5-HT-induced increase in excitatory postsynaptic currents frequency. The potency of three 5-HT2 receptor antagonists with varying selectivity for 5-HT2A/2B/2C receptors tested against the 5-HT-induced increase in excitatory postsynaptic current frequency are in agreement with the affinity of these drugs for the 5-HT2A receptor. These findings suggest that 5-HT2A receptor or alpha(1)-adrenoceptor activation enhance neurotransmitter release from a similar subset of glutamate terminals that innervate apical dendrites of layer V pyramidal cells.
