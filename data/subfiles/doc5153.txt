Heimbold, I., et al. (2002). "Synthesis, biological and autoradiographic evaluation of a novel Tc-99m radioligand derived from WAY 100635 with high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and the alpha1-adrenergic receptor." Nucl Med Biol 29(4): 375-387.

	This paper reports the synthesis, biological evaluation, in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography of the first Tc-99m ligand with subnanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and a remarkably high affinity for the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor. The neutral "3+1" mixed-ligand complex combines 4-(6-mercaptohexyl)-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine as monodentate and 3-(N-methyl)azapentane-1,5-dithiol as tridentate unit with oxotechnetium(V). The analogous rhenium complex was synthesized for complete structural characterization and used in receptor binding assays. In competition experiments both complexes display subnanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (IC50 0.24 nm for Re, 0.13 nM for Tc) but also very high affinities for the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor (IC50 0.05 nM for Re. 0.03 nM for Tc). Biodistribution studies show a brain uptake in rat of 0.22% ID five minutes post injection. In vitro atuoradiographic studies in rat brain and postmortem human brain indicate accumulation of the Tc-99m complex in brain areas which are rich in 5-HT1A receptors or in alpha 1-adreneigic receptors. This in vitro enrichment can be blocked respectively by the 5-HT1A. receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT or by prazosin hydrochloride, an alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Ex vivo autoradiographic studies in rats show a slight accumulation of the Tc-99m complex in 5-HT1A receptor-rich areas of the brain, which could not be blocked, as well as in regions rich in alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, which could be blocked by prazosin hydrochloride.
