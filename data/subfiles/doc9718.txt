Olsen, A. S., et al. (2012). "Traumatic brain injury-induced cognitive and histological deficits are attenuated by delayed and chronic treatment with the 5-HT1A-receptor agonist buspirone." J Neurotrauma 29(10): 1898-1907.

	The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential efficacy of the serotonin(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor agonist buspirone (BUS) on behavioral and histological outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Ninety-six isoflurane-anesthetized adult male rats were randomized to receive either a controlled cortical impact or sham injury, and then assigned to six TBI and six sham groups receiving one of five doses of BUS (0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.3, or 0.5 mg/kg) or saline vehicle (VEH, 1.0 mL/kg). Treatments began 24 h after surgery and were administered intraperitoneally once daily for 3 weeks. Motor function (beam-balance/beam-walk tests) and spatial learning/memory (Morris water maze) were assessed on post-operative days 1-5 and 14-19, respectively. Morphologically intact CA1/CA3 cells and cortical lesion volume were quantified at 3 weeks. No differences were observed among the BUS and VEH sham groups in any end-point measure and thus the data were pooled. Regarding the TBI groups, repeated-measures ANOVAs revealed that the 0.3 mg/kg dose of BUS enhanced cognitive performance relative to VEH and the other BUS doses (p<0.05), but did not significantly impact motor function. Moreover, the same dose conferred selective histological protection as evidenced by smaller cortical lesions, but not greater CA1/CA3 cell survival. No significant behavioral or histological differences were observed among the other BUS doses versus VEH. These data indicate that BUS has a narrow therapeutic dose response, and that 0.3 mg/kg is optimal for enhancing spatial learning and memory in this model of TBI. BUS may have potential as a novel pharmacotherapy for clinical TBI.
