	Central serotonin (5-HT) and angiotensin (ANG II) stimulate arginine vasopressin (AVP), oxytocin (OT), and adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) secretion and increase blood pressure. Studies were conducted in conscious rats to determine whether neuroendocrine activation by 5-HT requires a brain angiotensinergic intermediate pathway. In the first study, ANG LI formation was inhibited by the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril before injection of the 5-HT releaser/uptake inhibitor d-fenfluramine. Fenfluramine (2 mg/kg ip) stimulated AVP, OT, corticosterone, and prolactin (PRL) secretion (P < 0.01). Enalapril (60 mg/l in drinking water for 4 days and 10 mg/kg ip 2 h before rats were killed) inhibited only the AVP response (P < 0.01) to d-fenfluramine. In the second study, the effect of intracerebroventricular injection of the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist LY-53857 (10 mu g), or the ANG II AT(1) antagonist DuP-753 (10 mu g), on intracerebroventricular 5-HT (10 mu g)stimulated AVP, OT, ACTH, PRL, renin secretion, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) was tested. LY-53857 inhibited the AVP, OT, and ACTH responses to 5-HT (P < 0.01), whereas DuP-753 inhibited only the AVP response (P < 0.01). Intraventricular injection of 5-HT increased MAP and decreased HR. The MAP response was not affected by LY-53857 or DuP-753, and at no time did MAP decline below starting levels. The decreased HR was inhibited by LY-53857 but not by DuP-753. These results demonstrate that 5-HT-induced AVP secretion is mediated selectively via brain angiotensinergic mechanisms by way of the AT(1) receptor.
