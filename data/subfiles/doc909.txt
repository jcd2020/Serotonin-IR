Betti, L., et al. (2004). "Design, synthesis, and alpha(1)-adrenoceptor binding properties of new arylpiperazine derivatives bearing a flavone nucleus as the terminal heterocyclic molecular portion." Bioorg Med Chem 12(6): 1527-1535.

	Following our research project aimed at obtaining new compounds with high affinity and selectivity toward alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (AR), a new class of piperazine derivatives was designed, synthesized and biologically tested. The new compounds 1-13 are characterized by a flavone system linked, through an ethoxy or propoxy spacer, to a phenyl- or pyridazinone-piperazine moiety. Biological data showed an interesting profile for the phenylpiperazine subclass found to have a nanomolar affinity toward alpha(1)-AR, and less pronounced affinity for alpha(2)-AR and the 5-HT(1A) serotoninergic receptor. A discussion on the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of such compounds is also reported, on the basis of the flavone substitution pattern, length and functionalization of the spacer, and disruption of the phenylpiperazine system.
