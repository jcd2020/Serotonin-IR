	The availability of the primary amino acid sequence for a large numbers of molecules provides a fruitful opportunity for their cellular localization by utilizing the procedure of antipeptide antibody formation. This procedure permits a synthetic peptide sequence to be attached to a carrier molecule for the purpose of inoculating an animal to raise specific antibodies against the selected protein sequence. In this report we describe a number of steps that can be taken to increase the likelihood that the selected peptide sequence will be specific and antigenic. In addition, we describe how the peptides are synthesized, purified and coupled to keyhold limpet hemocyanin. The preparation of the antibody and its characterization are also presented in this method report. The immunocytochemical staining at both the light and ultrastructural level with serotonin (5-HT1A) receptor antipeptide antibodies is discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of this procedure are summarized.
