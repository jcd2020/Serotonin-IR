Bianchi, C., et al. (2007). "Serotonin modulation of cell excitability and of [3H]GABA and [3H]D-aspartate efflux in primary cultures of rat cortical neurons." Neuropharmacology 52(3): 995-1002.

	The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) on neuronal excitability, evaluated as depolarization-induced firing rate, and on amino acid release, measured as electrically-evoked [(3)H]GABA and [(3)H]d-aspartate efflux, were investigated in rat primary cortical neuronal cultures. 5-HT displayed a concentration-dependent, bimodal effect on neuronal excitability: at 3-10microM it increased excitability through 5-HT(2A) receptors, and was blocked by the selective 5-HT(2A) antagonist MDL 100907, whereas at 30-100microM it reduced excitability through 5-HT(1A) receptors, and was, in turn, blocked by the selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist WAY 100135. The electrically-evoked [(3)H]GABA efflux was concentration-dependently inhibited by 5-HT (pEC(50)=4.74) and such inhibition was prevented by WAY 100135, but not by GR 55562, a selective 5-HT(1D/B) receptor antagonist. Conversely, 5-HT concentration-dependently increased stimulus-evoked [(3)H]d-aspartate efflux (pEC(50)=4.71). The increase was facilitated by methiothepin and was reversed into inhibition by ICS 205930, a selective 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist. In the presence of ICS 205930, the inhibition induced by 5-HT was prevented by the selective 5-HT(1D/B) receptor antagonist GR 55562, but not by WAY 100135. These findings suggest that 5-HT inhibits GABA release through 5-HT(1A) receptors and exerts a dual modulation on glutamate release, mostly facilitatory (through 5-HT(3) receptors) but also inhibitory (through 5-HT(1D/B) receptors), leading to a prevalently positive modulation of the excitatory signal by amino acid neurotransmitter containing neurons.
