Noda-Saita, K., et al. (1999). "Dopamine D4-like binding sites labeled by H-3 nemonapride include substantial serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in primate cerebral cortex." Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications 255(2): 367-370.

	Dopamine D4-like binding sites are abundant in human cerebral cortex as detected by [H-3]nemonapride. The extremely low density of D4 mRNA in human cerebral cortex is inconsistent with the high amount of D4-like binding sites. To investigate the nature of the D4-like receptors, [H-3]nemonapride binding sites in the nonhuman primate cerebral cortex were characterized. Although [H-3]nemonapride binding sites were D4-like, displaceable by clozapine but not raclopride, [H-3]nemonapride binding was not displaced by selective D4 antagonists but was displaced by the selective 5-HT2A antagonist MDL100907. Using [H-3]ketanserin as a 5-HT2A ligand, nemonapride showed high affinity for monkey (K-i = 10.4 nM) and cloned human (K-i = 9.4 nM) 5-HT2A receptors, while its affinity for rat receptors was lower (K-i = 140 nM). The present study demonstrates that cerebral cortical D4-like binding sites labeled by [H-3]nemonapride in nonhuman primates consist of a very small portion of D4, but a substantial portion of 5-HT2A receptors, The unexpectedly high affinity of nemonapride for primate 5-HT2A receptor suggests reconsidering previous data from other studies using [H-3]nemonapride, particularly those on D4-like receptors.
