Wada, Y., et al. (1997). "Role of serotonin receptor subtypes in the development of amygdaloid kindling in rats." Brain Res 747(2): 338-342.

	The present study was conducted to identify serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes involved in the development of amygdala (AM) kindling. We used 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A agonist, and 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), a 5-HT2 agonist, both of which were injected subcutaneously 15 min prior to each daily electrical stimulation to the rat AM. Treatment with 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) slightly suppressed behavioral and electrographic seizure development during the course of kindling. In contrast, DOI (1 mg/kg) strongly facilitated kindling development and reduced the number of stimulations needed to produce generalized seizures. These facilitatory effects of DOI were completely blocked by pretreatment with a 5-HT2 antagonist ketanserin. The present results suggest that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors can retard the development of AM kindling, whereas 5-HT2 receptors play a facilitatory role in this developmental seizure process.
