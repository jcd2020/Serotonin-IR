	The classification of receptors involved in the emetic reflex has completely changed during the past 10 years. Today investigational agents acting as combined 5-HT3 antagonists/5-HT4 agonists, dopamine D2/D3 antagonists and the neurokinin1 antagonists are in focus. Positron emission tomography (PET) is rapidly advancing as an investigational tool in the detection and staging of cancer and in the evaluation of response to treatment. It is emphasized that PET could also be useful in further investigations of the pathophysiology of emesis. Though antiemetic treatment has been optimized, delayed emesis, emesis during multiple cycles and, especially, refractory emesis after chemotherapy continue to present significant challenges requiring further clinical investigations, as does the syndrome of chronic nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced cancer.
