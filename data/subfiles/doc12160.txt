Young, A. H., et al. (1993). "THE EFFECTS OF ADRENALECTOMY AND OVARIECTOMY ON THE BEHAVIORAL AND HYPOTHERMIC RESPONSES OF RATS TO 8-HYDROXY-2(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN (8-OH-DPAT)." Neuropharmacology 32(7): 653-657.

	The aim of this study was to determine the effects of sex, corticosterone and oestradiol-17beta on the hypothermia and motor behavioural syndrome induced by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) in the rat. The hypothermia, but not the behavioural syndrome induced by 8-OH-DPAT was significantly greater in female compared with male rats. Adrenalectomy in male rats enhanced the hypothermic response, an effect prevented by corticosterone implants. Ovariectomy significantly attenuated the hypothermia induced by 8-OH-DPAT, an effect prevented by oestradiol-17beta implants. Neither type of steroid manipulation affected the behavioural syndrome. These results show that sex, corticosterone and oestradiol-17beta modulate the hypothermic response to 8-OH-DPAT in the rat, with corticosterone and oestradiol-17beta having opposing effects.
