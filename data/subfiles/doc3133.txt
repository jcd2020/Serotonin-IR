	The 5-HT5A receptor is a seven-transmembrane receptor negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase, whose activation opens K+ channels. The 5-HT5A receptor may thus exert an inhibitory effect on neuronal activity. However, the function of this receptor is still largely unknown, in particular at the spinal level, and this is partly due to lack of specific ligands. Immunocytochemistry using specific anti-5-HT5A antibodies reveals a particularly dense labeling in the two superficial layers of the dorsal horn, suggesting that the 5-HT5A receptor may be involved in the spinal modulation of pain. In addition, a very intense staining in the lumbar dorsolateral nucleus (Onuf nucleus) in both males and females suggests that the 5-HT5A receptor is also involved in micturition through the control of urethral sphincter muscles. Colchicine pretreatment allows the staining of numerous cell bodies in lamina II. Fewer labeled cell bodies are seen in laminae I and III-VI, in the lateral spinal nucleus, and in lamina X. Electron microscope examination of 5-HT5A receptor immunoreactivity in spinal cords from untreated animals confirmed the postsynaptic labeling in all regions studied (dorsal horn, dorsolateral nucleus, and lamina X). The morphological heterogeneity of labeled dorsal horn cell bodies suggests that they belong to functionally distinct neurons (projection neurons and interneurons). In the lumbar dorsolateral nucleus, the labeling is preferentially localized on dendrites, suggesting that in this nucleus 5-HT preferentially acts at the dendritic level. Finally, the dense labeling of postsynaptic specializations suggests that the receptor may be in stock before being addressed to the synaptic differentiation. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
