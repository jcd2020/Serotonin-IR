	We examined the effects of neonatal treatment with MK-801 on 1-(2.5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI)-induced head shaking as well as [H-3]ketanserin binding in adult rats. Neonatal rats were injected with MK-801 (0.25 mg/kg, s.c., twice daily) or with saline from postnatal days (PND) 7-18. At PND 60, a statistically significant increase in the frequency of head shaking induced by DOI (1.0 mg/kg, s.c.) was observed in the rats neonatally treated with MK-801. compared to saline-treated rats. without any change in the specific [H-3]ketanserin binding in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that repeated NMDA receptor blockades during the critical period of brain development produce a long Lasting hyper-responsiveness in the 5-HT2A receptor-mediated behavior, interfering with the development of neural circuits related to the behavior.
