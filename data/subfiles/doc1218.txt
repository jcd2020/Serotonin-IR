	In the search for antidepressant agents with a rapid onset of action, we have found that compound BIMT 17 (1-[2-[4-(3-trifluoromethy)phenyl)piperazin- 1-yl]ethyl]benzimidazol-[1H]-2-one) shows a good affinity for cerebral cortical 5-HT1A (pK(i) = 7.72) and 5-HT2A (pK(i) = 6.90) receptors, with no appreciable affinity for the other 5-HT receptor subtypes, including 5-HT2C. BIMT 17 reduced forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the cerebral cortex (pEC(50) = 6.09) and in the hippocampus (pEC(50) = 6.50), and antagonized 5-HT-induced phosphatidylinositol turnover (pK(i) = 6.96) in the cerebral cortex. The effect on cAMP accumulation was blocked by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist tertatolol. Buspirone, 8-OH-DPAT and S 14671 {1-[2-(2-thenoylamino)ethyl]-4[1-(7-methoxynaphtyl)]-piperazine}, claimed to be 5-HT1A receptor agonists, did not reduce forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in the cerebral cortex. On the basis of these data, it was concluded that BIMT 17 was the only compound that behaved as a full agonist with respect to the cAMP response in the cortex, while exerting concurrent agonism at 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism at 5-HT2A receptors. These characteristics might explain the peculiar behaviour of BIMT 17 in mimicking; the inhibitory action of 5-HT on the basal firing rate of the cortical neurons (see accompanying paper).
