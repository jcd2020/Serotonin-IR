	This paper describes the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonism of Y-25130 ((+/-)-N-(1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]oct-3-yl)-6-chloro-4-methyl-3-oxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-1, 4-benzoxazine-8-carboxamide monohydrochloride) in the rat cerebral cortex, isolated rabbit heart and isolated guinea pig ileum. In an in vitro binding assay, Y-25130 inhibited the specific binding of [H-3]quipazine to 5-HT3 receptors at the synaptic membranes of the rat cerebral cortex with a K(i) value of 2.9 nM, the same as that of ondansetron. Metoclopramide, 5-HT and 2-methyl-5-HT also showed an inhibitory effect, but their affinities for 5-HT3 receptors were lower than that of Y-25130. Y-25130 showed low affinity for histamine H-1 receptors (IC50 = 4.4-mu-M) but it could not reveal any affinities for the other receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT2, dopamine D1, dopamine D2, alpha-1-adrenoceptor, alpha-2-adrenoceptor, muscarine and benzodiazepine) even at a 10-mu-M concentration. In the isolated rabbit heart, Y-25130 antagonized the indirect sympathomimetic responses to 5-HT (pA2 value = 10.06) and this effect was more potent than that of metoclopramide. In the isolated longitudinal smooth muscle of the guinea pig ileum, concentration-contraction effect curves for 5-HT were biphasic in the presence of ketanserin. Y-25130 shifted to the right only in the second phase of concentration-effect curves for 5-HT (pA2 value = 7.04) and its activity was more potent than that of metoclopramide. These results indicate that Y-25130 is a potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist.
