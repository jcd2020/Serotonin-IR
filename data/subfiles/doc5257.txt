	Prenatal cocaine exposure results in behavioral abnormalities throughout development in rats, but little is known regarding the biological mechanisms underlying these abnormalities. Pregnant rats received subcutaneous twice-daily injections (1 ml/kg) of normal saline or 15 mg/kg of cocaine hydrochloride throughout gestation (gestation days 1-20). Following delivery, pups were placed with untreated surrogates. Male and female pups were killed on postnatal days 30, 60 or 120 for assessment of 5-HT(1A) receptor development in the forebrain, diencephalon, midbrain and pons using radiolabel immunocytochemistry. Findings revealed gender and age differences in developmental regulation of 5-HT(1A) receptors, indicating that male rats are more susceptible to long-term consequences of prenatal cocaine exposure in comparison to females. This study also demonstrates gender-specific development of serotonin (5-HT(1A)) receptors across postnatal ages, demonstrating a fundamentally different pattern of development of 5-HT(1A) receptors between males and females.
