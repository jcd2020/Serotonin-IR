Fone, K. C. F., et al. (1996). "Increased 5-HT2C receptor responsiveness occurs on rearing rats in social isolation." Psychopharmacology 123(4): 346-352.

	To investigate whether isolation rearing alters 5-hydroxytryptamine(2C) (5-HT2C) receptors, the effect of the serotonin agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) was examined on elevated plus-maze behaviour, plasma corticosterone and brain 5-HT2C receptor protein levels in rats. There was no distinction between behaviour or corticosterone levels in drug-free isolates or socially housed rats exposed to the elevated plus-maze. The anxiogenic response to mCPP (decrease in open arm entry and time and an increase in stretch attend postures) on the elevated plus-maze was greater in isolation than in socially reared controls without any concomitant difference in the hypolocomotor effect of mCPP in the two groups. mCPP produced a greater elevation in plasma corticosterone in isolates than in group-housed controls. Hippocampal 5-HT2C receptor protein-like immunoreactive levels were significantly lower following mCPP than saline only in rats reared in isolation. These results indicate that increased 5-HT2C receptor responsiveness accompanies isolation-rearing and may contribute to the enhanced response to stress and the increased neophobia seen in this animal model of trait anxiety/depression. In isolation reared rats, rapid down-regulation of supersensitive 5-HT2C receptors may occur in the hippocampus following 5-HT agonist challenge.
