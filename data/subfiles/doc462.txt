Auclair, A., et al. (2004). "Role of serotonin 2A receptors in the D-amphetamine-induced release of dopamine: comparison with previous data on alpha1b-adrenergic receptors." J Neurochem 91(2): 318-326.

	D-amphetamine is known to induce an increase in dopamine release in subcortical structures, thus inducing locomotor hyperactivity in rodents. Previous data have indicated that only 15% of the D-amphetamine-induced release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens is related to locomotor activity and that this 'functional' dopamine release is controlled by alpha1b-adrenergic receptors located in the prefrontal cortex. We show here that SR46349B (0.5 mg/kg, 30 min before D-amphetamine), a specific serotonin2A (5-HT(2A)) antagonist, can completely block 0.75 mg/kg D-amphetamine-induced locomotor activity without decreasing D-amphetamine-induced extracellular dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens. Using the same experimental paradigm as before, i.e. a systemic injection of D-amphetamine accompanied by a continuous local perfusion of 3 microM D-amphetamine, we find that SR46349B (0.5 mg/kg) blocks completely the systemic (0.75 mg/kg) D-amphetamine-induced functional dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens. Finally, the bilateral injection of SR46349B (500 pmol/side) into the ventral tegmental area blocked both the D-amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and functional dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens, whereas bilateral injection of SR46349B into the medial prefrontal cortex was ineffective. We propose that 5-HT(2A) and alpha1b-adrenergic receptors control a common neural pathway responsible for the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens by psychostimulants.
