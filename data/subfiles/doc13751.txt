Yan, H., et al. (2002). "An integrative pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (S)-UH-301 in the rat." Eur Neuropsychopharmacol 12(2): 101-110.

	(S)-UH-301 ((-)-(S)-5-fluoro-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrochloride) is a well known 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist. The present study describes the pharmacokinetic properties of (S)-UH-301 after subcutaneous administration in rats, using a newly developed HPLC-UV bioanalytical method. The relationships between (S)-UH-301 concentrations and some pharmacodynamic effects were also studied. The AUC of (S)-UH-301 in brain, but not in plasma, increased in proportion to dose (1-100 mumol/kg). However, at doses above 32 mumol/kg, peak concentrations of the drug did not increase in proportion to dose, and there was a doubling of its apparent half-life. There was a good correspondence between the time courses for the antagonism of 8-OH-DPAT-induced motor behaviours and hypothermia and the tissue concentrations of (S)-UH-301. Doses of (S)-UH-301 above 10 mumol/kg decreased 5-HT and dopamine synthesis. Therefore, a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonistic dose range of (S)-UH-301 should be 0.1-10 mumol/kg s.c., corresponding to concentrations below approximately 10 nmol/g in brain and approximately 1 nmol/ml in plasma.
