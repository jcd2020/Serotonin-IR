	Depression is a dysthymia disorder characterized by a pervasive or persistent mental disorder that causes mood, cognitive and memory deficits. J147, a curcumin analogue, increases brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and facilitates memory in animals. Because curcumin has the antidepressant-like activity, the present study investigated the potential antidepressant-like effects of J147 in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension tests (TST) and the involvement of 5-HT receptors related to cAMP signaling. The results suggested that acute treatment of J147 at doses of 5 and 10mg/kg via gavage markedly reduced the duration of immobility in both TST and FST, either 1h or 3h after treatment, respectively. It did not alter locomotor activity but influence the immobile response. The molecular biological assays showed that 5-HT1A receptor expression was significantly increased at 1h after treatment with J147 at a dose of 10mg/kg. In addition, pre-treatment of mice with WAY-100635 blocked the J147's effect in the FST. 5-HT1B receptor expression was not significantly increased with increasing doses of J147. The 5-HT1B receptors antagonist isamoltan partially prevented J147's effect in the FST. The levels of downstream molecular targets, cAMP, PKA, pCREB and BDNF were significantly increased 1h after treatment with J147 at doses of 5 and 10mg/kg. The up-regulated pCREB and BDNF levels lasted for 3h after 10mg/kg of J147. These findings demonstrated that J147 has antidepressant-like effects that are mediated, at least in part, by activating the 5-HT1A/cAMP/PKA/CREB/BDNF-signaling pathway.
