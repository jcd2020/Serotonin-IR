Kitamura, Y., et al. (2007). "Effects of imipramine on extracellular serotonin and noradrenaline concentrations in ACTH-treated rats." Eur J Pharmacol 566(1-3): 113-116.

	We investigated the effect of imipramine on extracellular serotonin (5-HT) and noradrenaline concentrations in the medial prefrontal cortex of rats treated with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) for 14 days using in vivo microdialysis. Chronic ACTH treatment did not affect basal extracellular 5-HT and noradrenaline concentrations compared with chronic saline treatment. Acute imipramine treatment plus chronic ACTH treatment significantly increased extracellular 5-HT concentrations, compared with imipramine treatment alone. 8-hydroxy-2-di-n-propylamino tetralin (8-OH-DPAT), a 5-HT1A receptors full agonist, caused a significant decrease in extracellular 5-HT concentrations. However, its inhibitory effect was attenuated by the treatment with ACTH for 14 days. These findings suggest that chronic treatment with ACTH enhances the increasing effect release of 5-HT by imipramine through the desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors.
