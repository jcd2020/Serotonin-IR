	AIM: To determine whether serotonin, a major neurotransmitter in brain, can modulate the production of secretory beta-amyloid protein precursor (sAPP) by activation of serotonin 5-HT2C receptor. METHODS: The hippocampal slices of rats were incubated with various concentrations of serotonin, M-110, or L-107. sAPP released into the incubation medium were assayed by Western blot analysis assay with monoclonal antibody 22C11 for 2 h. RESULTS: Various concentrations of serotonin (1.0 x 10(-2) - 1.0 x 10(3) micromol x L(-1)), M-110, a serotonin 5-HT2C agonist (1.5 x 10(-6) - 1.5 x 10(3) micromol x L(-1)), showed positive effect on the production of sAPP while L-107, a serotonin 5-HT2C antagonist (1.0 x 10(-9) - 1.0 x 10(3) micromol x L(-1)), showed negative effect on the production of sAPP over controls. CONCLUSION: Serotonin modulates production of secretory amyloid beta-protein precursor through serotonin 5-HT2C receptor in incubated rat hippocampal slices.
