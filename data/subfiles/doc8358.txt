Ohno, M. and S. Watanabe (1997). "Differential effects of 5-HT3 receptor antagonism on working memory failure due to deficiency of hippocampal cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission in rats." Brain Res 762(1-2): 211-215.

	The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine significantly increased the number of errors (attempts to pass through two incorrect panels of the three panel-gates at four choice points) in the working memory task with a three-panel runway setup, when injected bilaterally at 3.2 microg/side into the dorsal hippocampus. Concurrent infusion of the selective and potent 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist Y-25130 (0.32 and 1.0 microg/side) significantly attenuated the increase in working memory errors induced by intrahippocampal 3.2 microg/side scopolamine. Intrahippocampal Y-25130 (1.0 microg/side) by itself did not affect working memory errors. On the other hand, intrahippocampal administration of the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (+/-)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) at 32 ng/side caused a significant increase in the number of working memory errors. However, Y-25130 at 1.0 microg/side did not affect the increase in working memory errors when infused intrahippocampally together with 32 ng/side CPP. These results suggest that antagonism of hippocampal 5-HT3 receptors is ineffective against working memory failure resulting from blockade of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, but that it can compensate deficiency of septohippocampal cholinergic activity involved in working memory function of rats.
