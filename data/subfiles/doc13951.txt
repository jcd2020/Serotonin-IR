Zamfir, O., et al. (1992). "Effects of cold stress on some 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptor-mediated responses." Eur J Pharmacol 219(2): 261-269.

	The purpose of the present study was to analyze the influence of stress (24-h cold exposure) on presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors, and on postsynaptic 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C and 5-HT2 receptors. Cold exposure for 24 h affected neither pargyline-induced decreases in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels in midbrain and rest of brain, nor plasma glucose and corticosterone levels. Treatment with the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.5-1 mg/kg), 3-5 h after the end of cold exposure triggered less intense flat body posture and forepaw treading in cold-exposed rats than in controls. On the other hand, 15- and 30-min plasma glucose responses to 8-OH-DPAT (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, 3-5 h after cold) or to the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine (0.025 mg/kg), were not affected by cold, while the 15-min, but not the 30 min, plasma corticosterone response to 8-OH-DPAT was slightly amplified in cold-exposed rats. Cold exposure affected neither the inhibitory effect of 8-OH-DPAT (0.25-0.5 mg/kg, 3-5 h after cold) on midbrain 5-HIAA levels, nor the hypothermic effect of 8-OH-DPAT (0.5-1 mg/kg, 3-5 h after cold). Lastly, the hypoactivity elicited by the 5-HT1C receptor agonist, m-chlorophenyl-piperazine (1.5-3 mg/kg, 3-5 h after cold), or head shakes elicited by the 5-HT2 receptor agonist, 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (1-2 mg/kg, 3-5 h after cold), were of similar intensities in control and in cold-exposed rats.
