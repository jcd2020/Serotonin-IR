	During cancer chemotherapy, drugs such as 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists have typically been used to control vomiting and anorexia. We examined the effects of oxytocin (OXT), which has been linked to appetite, on cisplatin-induced anorexia in rats. Fos-like immunoreactivity (Fos-LI) expressed in the supraoptic nucleus (SON), the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), the area postrema and the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) after intraperitoneal (ip) administration of cisplatin. We also examined the fluorescence intensity of OXT-mRFP1 after ip administration of cisplatin in OXT-mRFP1 transgenic rats. The mRFP1 fluorescence intensity was significantly increased in the SON, the PVN, and the NTS after administration of cisplatin. The cisplatin-induced anorexia was abolished by OXT receptor antagonist (OXTR-A) pretreatment. In the OXT-LI cells, cisplatin-induced Fos expression in the SON and the PVN was also suppressed by OXTR-A pretreatment. These results suggested that central OXT may be involved in cisplatin-induced anorexia in rats.
