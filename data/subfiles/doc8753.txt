Peroutka, S. J. (1988). "Antimigraine drug interactions with serotonin receptor subtypes in human brain." Ann Neurol 23(5): 500-504.

	The interactions of antimigraine agents with serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptor subtypes were analyzed in human frontal cortex membranes. The drugs studied included 5-HT antagonists, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and calcium channel blockers. At 5-HT1A sites labeled by 3H-8-hydroxy-2-(N,N-dipropylamino)-tetralin, (-)pindolol, alprenolol, (-)propranolol, methysergide, cyproheptadine, and pizotifen are similar in that they display affinities of approximately 100 nM for this receptor. By contrast, only methysergide displays relatively high affinity (120 +/- 60 nM), whereas all other drugs have affinities greater than 1,000 nM for non-5-HT1A sites labeled by 3H-5-HT in human cortex. Finally, at 5-HT2 receptors labeled by 3H-spiperone, cyproheptadine, methysergide, and pizotifen are extremely potent agents (affinity constants of 1 to 10 nM), whereas amitriptyline (23 +/- 4 nM), verapamil (140 +/- 50 nM), and nifedipine (320 +/- 80 nM) are moderately potent. All other drugs are inactive at concentrations below 1,000 nM. These data demonstrate that most antimigraine drugs display high affinity for the 5-HT1A and/or 5-HT2 receptor subtypes in human brain. However, antimigraine efficacy cannot be explained by drug interactions with a single 5-HT receptor subtype.
