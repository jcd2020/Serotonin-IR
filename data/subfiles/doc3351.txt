Edwards, E. and J. F. Paton (1999). "5-HT(4) receptors in nucleus tractus solitarii attenuate cardiopulmonary reflex in anesthetized rats." Am J Physiol 277(5): H1914-1923.

	We determined whether the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway modulation of the cardiopulmonary reflex was caused by activation of 5-HT(4) receptors at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) of the anesthetized rat. NTS microinjection of 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT, 2.25 pmol, n = 13), a 5-HT-receptor agonist, attenuated the cardiopulmonary reflex-evoked bradycardia and tachypnea. Microinjection of RS-39604 (4.5 pmol, n = 6), a selective 5-HT(4)-receptor antagonist, blocked the attenuating effect of 5-MeOT. NTS microinjection of 8-bromoadenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-BrcAMP, 9 nmol, 45 nl, n = 10), a membrane-permeant analog of cAMP, significantly attenuated the reflex bradycardia and tachypnea. Rp-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate (4.5 nmol, n = 6), a cAMP-dependent PKA inhibitor, had no effect on the cardiopulmonary reflex when microinjected into the NTS alone but when given before a microinjection of either 8-BrcAMP (n = 6) or 5-MeOT (n = 6) blocked the attenuating effect on the reflex-evoked bradycardia. Thus stimulation of 5-HT(4) receptors within the NTS depresses the reflex bradycardia components of the cardiopulmonary reflex via a cAMP-dependent PKA pathway.
