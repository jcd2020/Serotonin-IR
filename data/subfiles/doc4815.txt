Howell, E., et al. (2019). "Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and 5-Hydroxytryptamine 2c (5-HT(2c)) Receptor Agonists in the Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) Inhibit Ghrelin-Stimulated Appetitive Reward." Int J Mol Sci 20(4).

	Current literature indicates that the orexigenic peptide ghrelin increases appetitive motivation via signaling in the mesolimbic reward system. Another gastric peptide, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), are both known to suppress operant responding for food by acting on key mesolimbic nuclei, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA). In order to investigate the interaction effects of ghrelin, GLP-1, and 5-HT within the VTA, we measured operant responding for sucrose pellets after the administration of ghrelin, the GLP-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4), and the 5-HT(2c) receptor agonist Ro60-0175 in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Following training on a progressive ratio 3 (PR3) schedule, animals were first injected with ghrelin into the VTA at doses of 3 to 300 pmol. In subsequent testing, separate rats were administered intraperitoneal (IP) Ex-4 (0.1⁻1.0 µg/kg) or VTA Ex-4 (0.01⁻0.1 µg) paired with 300 pmol ghrelin. In a final group of rats, the 5-HT(2c) agonist Ro60-0175 was injected IP (0.25⁻1.0 mg/kg) or into the VTA (1.5⁻3.0 µg), and under both conditions paired with 300 pmol ghrelin delivered into the VTA. Our results indicated that ghrelin administration increased operant responding for food reward and that this effect was attenuated by IP and VTA Ex-4 pretreatment as well as pre-administration of IP or VTA Ro60-0175. These data provide compelling evidence that mesolimbic GLP-1 and serotonergic circuitry interact with the ghrelinergic system to suppress ghrelin's effects on the mediation of food reinforcement.
