Dean, C. and M. Bago (2002). "Renal sympathoinhibition mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors in the RVLM during severe hemorrhage in rats." Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 282(1): R122-130.

	The role of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1A (5-HT(1A)) receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) in the mediation of the sympathoinhibitory and hypotensive responses to severe hemorrhage was examined in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized rats. The control response to hemorrhage (1 ml/min to 50 mmHg) consisted of a fall in arterial blood pressure and an initial baroreflex increase in renal sympathetic nerve activity followed after 2 min by a rapid decline in blood pressure accompanied by a decrease in renal sympathetic nerve activity. In response to hemorrhage in animals in which the specific 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist WAY-100635 was microinjected into the pressor area of the RVLM, the fall in blood pressure was delayed and attenuated while renal sympathetic nerve activity was increased and maintained above baseline. In barodenervated animals with blockade of RVLM 5-HT(1A) receptors, there was no change in renal sympathetic nerve activity in response to hemorrhage. These data suggest that renal sympathoinhibition elicited in response to severe hemorrhage is mediated by 5-HT(1A) receptors in the RVLM.
