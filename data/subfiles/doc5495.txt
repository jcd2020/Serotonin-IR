Kaur, P. and S. Ahlenius (2000). "Non-serotonergic potentiation by (-)-pindolol of DOI-induced forward locomotion in rats: possible involvement of beta-adrenoceptors?" Journal of Neural Transmission 107(8-9): 903-917.

	[1] We have previously shown that the beta-adrenergic/5-HT1 receptor partial agonist (-)-pindolol (2.0-32.0 mu molkg(-1)) enhances the increase in forward locomotion in rats produced by the 5-HT2 receptor agonist DOI (0.7 mu molkg(-1)) via net activation of post-synaptic 5-HT2 receptors. [2] It was found that neither the 5-HT1A receptor agonist and partial agonist, (+) 8-OH-DPAT (0.2-2.4 mu mol kg(-1)) and (S)-(-)-UH-301, respectively, nor the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY-100635 (0.09-1.5 mu molkg(-1)), substituted for (-)pindolol in this in vivo behavioral model. [3] This also applies to the 5-HT1B receptor agonist and antagonist anpirtoline (0.3-4.0 mu mol kg(-1)) and isamoltane (1.0-64.0 mu mol kg(-1)), respectively. Neither of these compounds mimicked (-)-pindolol in its interactions with DOI. [4] The(-)-pindolol/DOI-induced increase in forward locomotion could be antagonized by the beta(1) adrenoceptor antagonist betaxolol (24 mu molkg(-1)). [5] It is suggested that the intrinsic efficacy of (-)-pindolol at beta-adrenoceptors is an important aspect of its in vivo pharmacodynamic profile.
