	5-HT1A receptor-mediated signalling in rat brain was evaluated after chronic administration (14 days; s.c.) of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRRI) fluoxetine (10 mg/kg/day) alone, or in combination with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY100635 (0.1 mg/kg/day). The density of 5-HT1A binding sites was unchanged following fluoxetine, WAY100635, or the combination Of fluoxetine and WAY100635. However, the net stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding induced by the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT was significantly attenuated in dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), but not in hippocampus. after chronic fluoxetine. Moreover, depending of the area analysed, the basal binding of [S-35]GTP gamma S was differentially affected by this treatment: increased in DRN and decreased in hippocampal dentate gyrus. Interestingly, the changes in [S-35]GTP gamma S basal binding and on 5-HT1A receptors functionality were prevented by the concomitant administration of WAY100635. The inhibition of dorsal raphe firing by 8-OH-DPAT was also attenuated in fluoxetine-treated rats (ED50 = 2.12 +/- 0.32 mu g/kg and 4.34 +/- 0.09 mu g/kg, for vehicle and fluoxetine respectively), an effect which was also prevented by the concomitant administration of WAY100635 (ED50 = 2.10 +/- 0.58 mu g/kg). Chronic administration of WAY100635 alone did not affect the 5-HT1A receptor-induced stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, nor the 8-OH-DPAT-induced inhibition of 5-HT neuron firing. These results demonstrate that the concomitant blockade of 5-HT1A receptors when administering fluoxetine prevents those adaptive changes of 5-HT1A receptor function associated with the chronic administration of this antidepressant. These findings could be relevant from the therapeutic point of view, and further Support the potential benefit of treatments with a SSRI/5-HT1A receptor antagonist combination. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
