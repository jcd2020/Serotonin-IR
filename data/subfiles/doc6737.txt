	The anti-migraine drug zolmitriptan is a novel 5-HT1B/1D receptor partial agonist which, unlike sumatriptan, has been shown to cross the intact blood-brain barrier. in this study we examined whether or not the ability to access the cerebro-vascular intima affects the way in which a centrally-active 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist influences cranial haemodynamics. The effects of zolmitriptan on carotid arterial blood flow distribution were studied in anaesthetised cats using radiolabelled microspheres. Zolmitriptan (10-1000 mu g kg(-1) i.v.) selectively reduced arteriovenous-anastomotic (AVA) conductance producing a maximum decrease of 92.5 +/- 2.3%. The drug also produced a modest reduction in extra-cerebral conductance (23.9 +/- 6.5% maximum reduction at 30 mu g kg(-1), i.v.), but was without effect on cerebral conductance. Using laser doppler flowmetry in anaesthetised cats, zolmitriptan (1-30 mu g kg(-1), i.v.) produced dose-dependent decreases in ear microvascular conductance (15 +/- 5 to 60 +/- 6%) which mirrored decreases in carotid arterial conductance (12 +/- 11 to 61 +/- 5%). By contrast, zolmitriptan at doses up to 1000 mu g kg-l was without effect on cerebral microvascular conductance. Although zolmitriptan crosses the blood-brain barrier and can therefore access the cerebro-vascular intima, this study suggests that this property does not adversely affect cerebrovascular function.
