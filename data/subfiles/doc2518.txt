	Having shown a decrease in serotonin2A receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from schizophrenic subjects, we have now determined if this change was reflective of widespread changes in neurochemical markers in DLPFC in schizophrenia. In Brodmann's area (BA) 9 from 19 schizophrenic and 19 control subjects, we confirmed a decrease in the density of [3H]ketanserin binding to serotonin2A receptors in tissue from the schizophrenic subjects [39 +/- 3.3 vs. 60 +/- 3.6 fmol/mg estimated tissue equivalents (ETE); p < 0.005]. In addition, the density of [3H]muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors was increased in the schizophrenic subjects (526 +/- 19 vs. 444 +/- 28 fmol/mg ETE; p < 0.02). [3H]YM-09151-2, N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]-3,4-[3H]piperidine, [3H]SCH 23390, [3H]mazindol, and N(G)-nitro-L-[3H]arginine binding to BA 9 did not differ between groups, and there was no specific binding of [3H]raclopride or 7-hydroxy-2-(di-n-[3H]propylamino)tetralin to BA 9 from either cohort of subjects. This suggests the density of dopamine D1-like and NMDA receptors, the dopamine transporter, and nitric oxide synthase activity are not altered in BA 9 from schizophrenic subjects. The selective nature of the changes in serotonin2A and GABA(A) receptors in DLPFC could indicate that these changes are involved in the pathology of schizophrenia.
