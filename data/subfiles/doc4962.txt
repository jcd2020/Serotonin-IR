Idova, G. V., et al. (2005). "Significance of initial emotional state for neuroimmunomodulation under conditions of activation or blockade of 5-HT1A receptors." Zhurnal Vysshei Nervnoi Deyatelnosti Imeni I P Pavlova 55(4): 567-572.

	Selective agonist of 5-HT1A receptors - 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg) induced a suppression of the immune reaction in aggressive male CBA mice immunized with SRBC (5 x 10(8)). In submissive mice with 10-day defeat experience in confrontation tests, the activation of 5-HT1A receptors with 8-OH-DPAT did not alter the immune response, whereas the application of selective antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors WAY-100635 increased the immune reaction only in submissive mice. It is concluded that activation or blockade of 5-HT1A receptors produced different effects on the immune function of CBA mice depending on the initial emotional state which is known to be provided in aggressive and submissive animals by different activities of the brain neurotransmitter systems including the 5-HTergic system.
