	Serotonin (5-HT) is considered to play a significant role in anxiety-related behaviors in animals through actions on the amygdaloid complex. To evaluate this role from the point of neurotransmitter release regulation, nystatin-perforated patch recording was employed on mechanically dissociated basolateral amygdala neurons containing functional synaptic boutons. GABAAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) were pharmacologically separated. In subsets of neurons, 8-OH-DPAT (1 microM), a specific 5-HT1A agonist, continuously inhibited mIPSC frequency without effects on mIPSC amplitude. By comparison, mCPBG (1 microM), a specific 5-HT3 agonist, transiently facilitated mIPSC frequency without effects on mIPSC amplitude. Together these results suggest the presynaptic existence of both 5-HT receptor subtypes. In these neurons, application of 8-OH-DPAT and its subsequent removal still suppressed mCPBG-induced responses on mIPSCs. This suppression was not caused by a reduction of presynaptic 5-HT3 receptor affinities to mCPBG and was completely eliminated by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide, a pertussis toxin sensitive GTP-binding protein inhibitor. In the neurons exhibiting presynaptic modulation with mCPBG but not 8-OH-DPAT, such suppression by exposure to 8-OH-DPAT was not observed. In conclusion, activation of presynaptic 5-HT1A receptors inhibited mIPSC frequency and at the same time suppressed, via a G-protein-mediated mechanism, the transient facilitation of mIPSC frequency produced by activation of presynaptic 5-HT3 receptors.
