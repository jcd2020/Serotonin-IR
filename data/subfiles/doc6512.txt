	An increase in serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] levels in the rat visual cortex is correlated with the developmental decrease in long-term potentiation (LTP), and 5-HT may play an important role in the closure of the critical period by regulating LTP. The effect of 5-HT on the induction of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-dependent and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR)-dependent LTP in visual cortex slices from young rats was investigated. The field potential in layer II/III was recorded by stimulating the underlying layer IV. NMDAR-dependent LTP was induced in slices from 3-week-old rats by theta-burst stimulation (TBS) but not in slices from 5-week-old rats. However, LTP was induced in 5-HT-depleted slices from 5-week-old rats by incubation with para-chloroamphetamine (10 microM, 2 h), a 5-HT-depleting agent. The reinstated LTP in 5-HT-depleted slices was inhibited by the application of D-aminopentanoate, an NMDAR antagonist (50 microM) and 5-HT (10 and 30 microM). In contrast, the induction of mGluR-dependent LTP by weak TBS in disinhibited slices with picrotoxin (1 microM) in the bath was not affected by 5-HT application. The coapplication of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor agonists inhibited the induction of NMDAR-dependent LTP in 5-HT-depleted slices. 5-HT levels in the visual cortex increased with age. Based on these findings, we conclude that NMDAR-dependent LTP is specifically inhibited by coactivation of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors with the increase in 5-HT levels in the rat visual cortex at the end of the critical period.
