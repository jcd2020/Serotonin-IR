van Praag, H. M. (1996). "Faulty cortisol/serotonin interplay. Psychopathological and biological characterisation of a new, hypothetical depression subtype (SeCA depression)." Psychiatry Res 65(3): 143-157.

	The hypothesis is proposed of a new subtype of depression named: stressor-precipitated, cortisol-induced, serotonin-related, anxiety/aggression-driven depression (SeCA depression). Biologically, these patients are characterized by impaired 5-HT synthesis and reduced 5-HT1A receptor sensitivity. Under normal conditions these functions proceed marginally; in times of stress they easily fail, due to sustained overproduction of cortisol. Psychopathologically this depression type shows the following characteristics: anxiety and aggression, not mood lowering, heralding a depressive episode; the personality structure shows 'character neurotic' impairments and tolerance for (certain) traumatic life events is low. As specific therapeutic agents selective 5-HT1A agonists and cortisol or CRH antagonists are proposed. Prophylactically, maintenance treatment with 5-HT1A agonists seems indicated as well as psychological interventions to increase the stressor threshold.
