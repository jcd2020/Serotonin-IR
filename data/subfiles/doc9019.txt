Pranzatelli, M. R. and I. Galvan (1994). "ONTOGENY OF I-125 IODOCYANOPINDOLOL-LABELED 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(1B)-BINDING SITES IN THE RAT CNS." Neuroscience Letters 167(1-2): 166-170.

	Little is known about the ontogeny of the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) (5-HT1B) receptor, a putative terminal autoreceptor in the CNS. To learn more about the regional development of 5-HT1B sites and how early these sites may become functional, we studied [I-125]iodocyanopindolol ([125(I)]ICYP)labelled central 5-HT1B sites in developing postnatal rat brain and spinal cord. Significant ontogenic changes in B-max were found in neocortex, hippocampus, striatum and brainstem. Maximum binding-site density was reached by 21 days in hippocampus and cortex, but not until 28 days in striatum. The rank order of binding site density changed with rat age, but B-max was consistently high in brainstem and low in cerebellum. The percent increases B-max also varied with brain region, ranging from a 2-fold increase in brainstem up to 8-fold increases in cortex and striatum. In competition studies, the K-1 for 5-HT and for RU 24969 was the same in 5-day-old and adult rat brain. These data indicate regional differences in theontogeny of 5-HT1B-binding sites and suggest that 5-HT1B receptors are functional early in the postnatal period.
