HÃ¥llbus, M., et al. (1997). "Influence of 5-HT1B/1D receptors on dopamine release in the guinea pig nucleus accumbens: a microdialysis study." Neurosci Lett 225(1): 57-60.

	To clarify whether serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT1B/1D receptors are involved in dopamine (DA) release, extracellular levels of DA were monitored by in vivo microdialysis during various conditions. 5-HT (10 microM) alone, and together with the 5-HT1B/1D receptor antagonist. GR127935 (10 microM), or the 5-HT1B/1D agonist, sumatriptan (1 microM), were perfused into the nucleus accumbens of freely moving guinea pigs. A 10-fold increase in the extracellular concentration of DA was obtained during administration of 5-HT alone. The 5-HT-induced DA elevation was not significantly affected by co-administration of sumatriptan (MANOVA; P > 0.05) but markedly attenuated by coperfusion of GR127935 (MANOVA; P = 0.02). Neither GR127935 nor sumatriptan, when administered alone, significantly affected extracellular DA levels. These results suggest that, in the DA-rich nucleus accumbens, 5-HT1B/1D receptors are not involved in the modulation of DA release during normal tonic or basal conditions but may take part in the regulation of DA release when synaptic 5-HT levels are very high.
