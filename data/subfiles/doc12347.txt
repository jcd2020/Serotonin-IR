	The petrosal ganglion supplies chemoafferent pathways via the glossopharyngeal (IXth) nerve to peripheral targets which release various neurotransmitters including serotonin (5-HT). Here, we combined rapid 5-HT application with patch clamp, whole-cell recording to investigate whether 5-HT receptors are expressed on isolated petrosal neurons (PN), cultured from 7-12 day-old rat pups. In responsive cells, the dominant effect of 5-HT was a rapid depolarization associated with a conductance increase in approximately 43% of the neurons (53/123); however, in a minority population ( approximately 6%; 8/123), 5-HT caused membrane depolarization associated with a conductance decrease. In the former group, 5-HT produced a transient inward current (I5-HT) in neurons voltage-clamped near the resting potential ( approximately -60 mV); the effect was mimicked by the 5-HT3 receptor-specific agonist, 2-methyl-5-HT, suggesting it was mediated by 5-HT3 receptors. Further, I5-HT was selectively inhibited by the 5-HT3 receptor-specific antagonist MDL72222 (1-10 microM), but was unaffected by either 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor antagonist, spiperone, or by 5-HT2 receptor-specific antagonist, ketanserin (50-100 microM). I5-HT displayed moderate inward rectification and had a mean reversal potential (+/-S.E.M.) of -4.3+/-6.6 mV (n=6). Application of 5-HT (dose range: 0.1-100 microM) produced a dose-response curve that was fitted by the Hill equation with EC50= approximately 3.4 microM and Hill coefficient= approximately 1.6 (n=8). The activation phase of I5-HT (10 microM 5-HT at -60 mV) was well fitted by a single exponential with mean (+/-S.E.M.) time constant of 45+/-30 ms (n=6). The desensitization phase of I5-HT was best fitted by a single exponential with mean (+/-S.E.M.) time constant of 660+/-167 ms (n=6). Fluctuation analysis yielded an apparent mean single-channel conductance (+/-S.E.M) of 2.7+/-1.5 pS (n=4) at -60 mV. In the minority ( approximately 6%) population of neurons which responded to 5-HT with a conductance decrease, the depolarization was blocked by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, ketanserin (50 microM). Taken together, these results suggest that 5-HT3 receptors are the major subtype expressed by rat petrosal neurons, and therefore are candidates for facilitating chemoafferent excitation in response to 5-HT released from peripheral targets.
