Gaster, L. M., et al. (1998). "The selective 5-HT1B receptor inverse agonist 1 '-methyl-5 2 '-methyl-4 '-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-yl carbonyl -2,3,6,7-tetrahy drospiro furo 2,3-f indole-3,4 '-piperidine (SB-224289) potently blocks terminal 5-HT autoreceptor function both in vitro and in vivo."

	5-HT1 receptors are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily and are negatively Linked to adenylyl cyclase activity. The human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors (previously known as 5-HT1D beta and 5-HT1D alpha, respectively), although encoded by two distinct genes, are structurally very similar. Pharmacologically, these two receptors have been differentiated using nonselective chemical tools such as ketanserin and ritanserin, but the absence of truly selective agents has meant that the precise function of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors has not been defined. In this paper we describe how, using computational chemistry models as a guide, the nonselective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor antagonist 4 was structurally modified to produce the selective 5-HT1B receptor inverse agonist 5, 1'-methyl-5-[[2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]carbonyl]-2,3,6,7-tetrahydrospiro[furo[2,3-f]indole-3,4'-piperidine] (SB-224289). This compound is a potent antagonist of terminal 5-HT autoreceptor function both in vitro and in vivo.
