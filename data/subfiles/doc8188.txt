	In the presence of 10(-6) M atropine, 5-HT induced a positive chronotropic and inotropic effect in isolated guinea-pig atrium preparation. Both propranolol, a beta-adrenoceptor blocker, and imipramine, a 5-HT uptake inhibitor, did not affect the response induced by 5-HT, indicating that a tyramine-like mechanism is not involved. The positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT was mimicked by several 5-HT3 receptor agonists. N omega-Methyl-5-HT, reported to have a high affinity for 5-HT1B recognition sites, was found to act as a 5-HT3 receptor agonist with higher efficacy. The other 5-HT receptor agonists tested did not produced any responses. The positive chronotropic effect of 5-HT was inhibited by various 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, such as tropisetron, granisetron, ondansetron, cisapride and zacopride, but it was unaffected by various 5-HT receptor antagonists which are not selective for 5-HT3 receptor. Thus, the positive chronotropic response to 5-HT is a direct effect, and it was suggested to be mediated by 5-HT3 receptor subtype with rather an atypical profile.
