Romero, L. and F. Artigas (1997). "Preferential potentiation of the effects of serotonin uptake inhibitors by 5-HT1A receptor antagonists in the dorsal raphe pathway: role of somatodendritic autoreceptors." J Neurochem 68(6): 2593-2603.

	5-HT1A autoreceptor antagonists enhance the effects of antidepressants by preventing a negative feedback of serotonin (5-HT) at somatodendritic level. The maximal elevations of extracellular concentration of 5-HT (5-HT(ext)) induced by the 5-HT uptake inhibitor paroxetine in forebrain were potentiated by the 5-HT1A antagonist WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg s.c.) in a regionally dependent manner (striatum > frontal cortex > dorsal hippocampus). Paroxetine (3 mg/kg s.c.) decreased forebrain 5-HT(ext) during local blockade of uptake. This reduction was greater in striatum and frontal cortex than in dorsal hippocampus and was counteracted by the local and systemic administration of WAY-100635. The perfusion of 50 micromol/L citalopram in the dorsal or median raphe nucleus reduced 5-HT(ext) in frontal cortex or dorsal hippocampus to 40 and 65% of baseline, respectively. The reduction of cortical 5-HT(ext) induced by perfusion of citalopram in midbrain raphe was fully reversed by WAY-100635 (1 mg/kg s.c.). Together, these data suggest that dorsal raphe neurons projecting to striatum and frontal cortex are more sensitive to self-inhibition mediated by 5-HT1A autoreceptors than median raphe neurons projecting to the hippocampus. Therefore, potentiation by 5-HT1A antagonists occurs preferentially in forebrain areas innervated by serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus.
