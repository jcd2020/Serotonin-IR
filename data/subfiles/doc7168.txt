	The effect 5-HT1A receptor activation on the temperature dependence of HVA calcium channel currents has been studied in acutely isolated DR neurones, using barium as the charge carrier. 8-OH-DPAT caused a reduction in the temperature dependence of the peak current amplitude. However the most dramatic effect of 8-OH-DPAT was a large reduction in Q10 for the current activation rate. This also occurred with direct G-protein activation using GTP gamma S. In the presence of GTP gamma S, current activation became bi-exponential, rather than mono-exponential as in the control situation. The time constants of both components were significantly slower than the controls, and the Q10 for both components was significantly lower. GDP beta S had no effect on the temperature dependence or kinetics of activation of HVA current. Depolarizing prepulses applied prior to test pulses were able to reverse the action of 8-OH-DPAT on the Q10 of the activation rate. When prepulses were applied to cells containing GTP gamma S, the activation rate Q10 was similar to control values. We postulate that the highly significant reduction in activation rate Q10, seen with both 8-OH-DPAT and GTP gamma S, is as a result of a change in the mechanism underlying activation of HVA channels on depolarization. Contrary to previous models of calcium current modulation our results show that the mechanisms responsible for slowed activation by transmitters and facilitation of the residual current by depolarizing prepulses have little in common. We present a new model of transmitter modulation of HVA current, consistent with a mechanistic approach to channel subunit structure.
