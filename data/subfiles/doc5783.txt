Inoue, T., et al. (1996). "Effect of citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, on the acquisition of conditioned freezing." Eur J Pharmacol 311(1): 1-6.

	The present study examined the effects of the selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor citalopram on the acquisition of conditioned freezing, an index of anxiety. Acute treatment with citalopram (1-10 mg/kg) dose dependently prevented the acquisition of conditioned freezing, while acute treatment with noradrenaline or dopamine reuptake inhibitors failed. The acute effect of citalopram was not antagonized by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist NAN190, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimmido butyl]piperazine or the 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist ICI169,369, 2-(2-dimethylaminoethylthio)-3-phenylquinoline hydrochloride. These results indicate or the 5-HT that selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors reduce not only the expression of conditioned freezing as reported previously, but also the acquisition of conditioned freezing. Both these effects of selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitors may be related to their clinical efficacy in the treatment of anxiety disorders.
