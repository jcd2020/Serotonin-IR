	Previous studies indicate that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces locomotor hyperactivity in rats by increasing the presynaptic release of serotonin (5-HT). Interactions between MDMA and 5-HT receptor antagonists suggest that the activating effects of MDMA are mediated via 5-HT1-like receptors. In order to assess the contribution of particular 5-HT receptor subtypes to the behavioral effects of MDMA, the present studies examined the development of tolerance and cross-tolerance to the behavioral effects of MDMA and selective 5-HT receptor agonists. In the first study, rats were pretreated with saline, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist (8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin, 1.0 mg/kg), a 5-HT1B receptor agonist [5-methoyx-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-pyridinyl)-1H-indole butane dioate (RU24969), 2.5 mg/kg] or a 5-HT1C/5-HT2 receptor agonist (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, 1.0 mg/kg) twice daily for 3 days. The behavioral response to S-MDMA (3.0 mg/kg) was assessed 36 hr after the last pretreatment injection. Pretreatment with RU24969 antagonized the activating effects of S-MDMA. In contrast, pretreatment with 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine did not alter the response to S-MDMA, and pretreatment with 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin reduced the activity of both control and S-MDMA-treated animals. In the second study, rats were pretreated with saline or RS-MDMA (10 mg/kg), twice daily for 4 days. The behavioral response to saline, S-MDMA (3.0 mg/kg), RU24969 (2.5 mg/kg) or S-amphetamine (1.0 mg/kg) was assessed 36 hr after the last pretreatment injection. Pretreatment with RS-MDMA antagonized the activating effects of S-MDMA and RU24969, but potentiated the activating effect of S-amphetamine. The antagonistic effect of RS-MDMA pretreatment on the behavioral response to S-MDMA and RU24969 was not evident when animals were retested 21 days later. Parallel biochemical studies indicate that the RS-MDMA pretreatment regimen induced a lasting depletion of forebrain 5-HT. Thus, the observation of acute reciprocal Gross-tolerance between the activating effects of MDMA and the RU24969 suggests that the behavioral effects of these drugs are mediated by the same receptors. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that release of endogenous 5-HT increases locomotor activity via stimulation of 5-HT1B receptors.
