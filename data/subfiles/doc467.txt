	In the present study, we investigated the effects of various serotonin (5-HT) antagonists on 5-HT's action on medial prefrontal cortical cells (mPFc) using the techniques of single cell recording and microiontophoresis. The microiontophoretic application of 5-HT (10-80 nA) produced a current-dependent suppression of mPFc cell firing and this effect was blocked by the selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (+/-)-zacopride, ICS 205930 and granisetron at currents of 5-20 nA. Furthermore, the intravenous (i.v.) administration of (+/-)-zacopride (5-50 micrograms/kg) markedly attenuates the suppressive action of 5-HT on mPFc cell firing. In contrast, the microiontophoresis of 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 receptor antagonists such as (+/-)-pindolol, spiperone, metergoline, and ritanserin (10-20 nA) failed to block 5-HT's effect. In fact, in some cells, spiperone and ritanserin potentiated 5-HT's action and prolonged neuronal recovery. In addition, the intravenous administration of either ritanserin (5-2,000 micrograms/kg) or metergoline (4-2,400 micrograms/kg) failed to alter 5-HT's action. The electrical stimulation of the caudal linear raphe nucleus (CLi) suppressed the spontaneous activity of 83% of the mPFc cells tested by 45 +/- 2%. This suppression was significantly attenuated by the iontophoresis of granisetron (2.5-5 nA) but not by the 5-HT2 and 5-HT1C receptor antagonist ritanserin or the relatively selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist (+)-MDL 11,939 (10-40 nA). However, the i.v. administration of ritanserin (0.5-1.5 mg/kg) or S-zacopride (0.1 mg/kg) significantly blocked the suppression of mPFc cell firing produced by CLi stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
