Hemrick-Luecke, S. K., et al. (1994). "Evaluation of nefazodone as a serotonin uptake inhibitor and a serotonin antagonist in vivo." Life Sci 55(7): 479-483.

	Nefazodone (2-[3-[4-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]-5-ethyl- 2,4-dihydro-4-(2-phenoxyethyl)-3H-1,2,4-triazol-3-one) has been reported to be effective in the treatment of depression. Antagonism of serotonin type 2A (5HT2A) receptors, as well as inhibition of the serotonin (5HT) uptake carrier, has been suggested to contribute to the antidepressant action of nefazodone in vivo (Eison et al., 1990). Nefazodone weakly antagonized the quipazine-induced rise in rat serum corticosterone levels and the quipazine-induced increase in rat hypothalamic 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol sulfate, suggesting blockade of 5HT2A receptors in vivo. Nefazodone, however, failed to antagonize the p-chloroamphetamine-induced depletion of mouse or rat brain 5HT, displaying a lack of effect on the 5HT uptake carrier. These data extend previous in vitro and in vivo data (Eison, et al. 1990) reporting nefazodone to be an antagonist at 5HT2A receptors, but fail to show inhibition of the 5HT uptake carrier in the same dose range.
