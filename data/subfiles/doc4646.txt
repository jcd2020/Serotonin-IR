	Kamiuntanto (KUT; Jia Wei Wen Dan Tang in Pinyin) is a traditional Japanese Kampo medicine that is used to treat psychological dysfunction. However, the mechanisms of action of KUT are not understood. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the ameliorative properties of KUT, the effects of KUT on abnormal behaviors of isolation-reared mice and on the prefrontal monoaminergic system were examined. KUT (1000 mg/kg) reversed encounter-induced hyperactivity and increased immobility in the forced swim test in isolation-reared mice, as also found for an antidepressant, fluoxetine (30 mg/kg). In vivo microdialysis showed that KUT (1000 mg/kg) transiently increased the level of extracellular serotonin (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, an incomplete KUT formula excluding Bambusae Caulis (BC), a component herb of KUT, did not reverse abnormal behaviors of isolation-reared mice or increase prefrontal extracellular 5-HT. Furthermore, the antidepressant-like effect of KUT in the forced swim test was prevented by pretreatment with GR127935, a 5-HT(1B) antagonist. These findings suggest that KUT may ameliorate depressive symptoms via 5-HTergic systems, and that BC plays an important role in the antidepressant-like effects of KUT.
