Sevoz, C., et al. (1996). "Medullary pathways of cardiovascular responses to 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor stimulation in the rat nucleus tractus solitarius." Neuroreport 7(12): 1965-1969.

	As previously found for the baroreceptor reflex. microinjection of kynurenic acid (KYN, 2 nmol), a glutamate receptor antagonist, into the caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVL) blocked the hypotension and bradycardia elicited by microinjections of a 5-HT2 receptor agonist, 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoampheramine (DOI.0.5 pmol) into the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS). In addition, as previously observed with the sympathetic chemoreflex response, microinjections of KYN into the RVL blocked the increase in blood pressure elicited by microinjections of 1-m-(chlorophenyl)-biguanide (1200 pmol), a 5-HT3 receptor agonist, into the NTS. These results suggest that medullary pathways involved in the responses to 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptor stimulation in the NTS are similar to those that mediate the baroceptor and chemoreceptor reflex responses, respectively.
