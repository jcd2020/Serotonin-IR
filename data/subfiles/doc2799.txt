Druse, M. J., et al. (2004). "The serotonin-1A agonist ipsapirone prevents ethanol-associated death of total rhombencephalic neurons and prevents the reduction of fetal serotonin neurons." Brain Res Dev Brain Res 150(2): 79-88.

	Previously, this laboratory showed that in utero and in vitro ethanol exposure significantly reduces developing serotonin (5-HT) neurons and that treatment with a 5-HT1A agonist such as buspirone or ipsapirone prevents the ethanol-associated loss. The present study investigated whether ethanol decreases fetal rhombencephalic neurons, including 5-HT neurons, by causing apoptosis. We also investigated whether ipsapirone prevents the ethanol-associated deficit of fetal rhombencephalic neurons by reducing apoptosis. The results of these studies strongly suggest that the ethanol-associated reduction in fetal rhombencephalic neurons that accompanies both in utero and in vitro exposure to physiological concentrations of ethanol is associated with increased apoptosis in these neurons. A physiological concentration of ethanol (i.e., 50 mM) increases apoptosis in fetal rhombencephalic neurons and decreases the number 5-HT neurons. It also appears that the 5-HT1A agonist ipsapirone provides neuroprotection to these neurons by reducing apoptosis. Another mechanism by which ethanol-associated apoptosis can be blocked is by including serum proteins in the media at a concentration of 1% or higher; this concentration of serum proteins is high in comparison to the protein concentration in cerebrospinal fluid.
