	In the current issue of ACS Chemical Neuroscience, Kim et al. report on the early characterization of 4-(3-[F-18] fluorophenethoxy)pyrimidine (F-18-FPP) as a new positron emission tomography radiotracer for imaging brain 5-HT2C receptors (Kim, J., et al. (2017) A potential PET radiotracer for the 5-HT2c receptor: Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of 4-(3-[F-18]Fluorophenethoxy)pyrimidine. ACS Chem. Neurosci., DOI: 10.1021/acschemneuro.6b00445). At the present time, the tracer properties of F-18-FPP have only been reported in rats. If F-18-FPP is indeed shown to be suitable as a 5-HT2C receptor PET tracer in humans, it will very likely have an important impact both in the development of any new chemical entities (NCEs) targeted to 5-HT2C receptors, as well as a tool to advance understanding of 5-HT2C receptor function both in normal and abnormal brain states.
