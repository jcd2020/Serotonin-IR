Jankowska, E., et al. (1994). "ALCOHOL-DRINKING IN RATS TREATED WITH 5,7-DIHYDROXYTRYPTAMINE - EFFECT OF 8-OH-DPAT AND TROPISETRON (ICS-205-930)." Alcohol 11(4): 283-288.

	5,7-Dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) was administered ICV to Wistar male rats. Lesioned rats displayed higher preference for ETOH than sham-lesioned animals. Among 5,7-DHT-pretreated rats 38% became high-preferring, while only 22% of sham-lesioned rats displayed this behavioural pattern (p < 0.05). Both 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; the agonist of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors) and tropisetron (ICS 205-930, the antagonist of 5-HT3 receptors) reduced ETOH consumption in high-preferring, sham-lesioned rats. However, in 5,7-DHT rats the effect of 8-OH-DPAT was completely abolished, while tropisetron retained its antipreference activity. Therefore, it seems that 5-HT1A autoreceptors are critically involved in 8-OH-DPAT action, while 5-HT3 receptor sites responsible for tropisetron action are located beyond the 5-HT system.
