	Endocannabinoids and their receptors not only contribute to the control of natural processes of appetite regulation and energy balance but also have an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity. CB1 receptors (CB1R) are expressed in several hypothalamic nuclei, including the paraventricular nucleus (PVN), where induce potent orexigenic responses. Activation of CB1R in the PVN induces hyperphagia by modulating directly or indirectly orexigenic and anorexigenic signals; however, interaction among these mediators has not been clearly defined. CB1R mRNA is expressed in serotonergic neurons that innervate the PVN, and activation of 5-HT receptors in the PVN constitutes an important satiety signal. Some GABAergic terminals are negatively influenced by 5-HT, suggesting that the hyperphagic effect of CB1R activation could involve changes in serotonergic and GABAergic signaling in the PVN. Accordingly, the present study was aimed to characterize the neurochemical mechanisms related to the hyperphagic effects induced by activation of CB1R in the PVN, studying in vitro and in vivo changes induced by direct activation these receptors. Here, we have found that the neurochemical mechanisms activated by stimulation of CB1 receptors in the PVN involve inhibition of 5-HT release, resulting in a decrease of serotonergic activity mediated by 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(1B) receptors and inducing disinhibition of GABA release to stimulate food intake. In conclusion, these neurochemical changes in the PVN are determinant to the cannabinoid-induced stimulation of food intake. Our findings provide evidence of a functional connection among CB1R and serotonergic and GABAergic systems on the control of appetite regulation mediated by endocannabinoids.
