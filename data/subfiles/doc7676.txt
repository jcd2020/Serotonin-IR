	Cholinergic neurons in the laterodorsal (LDT) and the pedunculopontine (PPT) tegmental nuclei act to promote REM sleep (REMS). The predominantly glutamatergic neurons of the REMS-induction region of the medial pontine reticular formation are in turn activated by cholinergic cells, which results in the occurrence of tonic and phasic components of REMS. All these neurons are inhibited by serotonergic (5-HT), noradrenergic, and presumably histaminergic (H-2 receptor) and dopaminergic (D-2 and D-3 receptor) cells. 5-Hydroxytryptamine-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) virtually cease firing when an animal starts REMS, consequently decreasing the release of 5-HT during this state. The activation of GABA, receptors is apparently responsible for this phenomenon. Systemic administration of the selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OHDPAT induces dose-dependent effects; i.e. low doses increase slow wave sleep and reduce waking, whereas large doses increase waking and reduce slow wave sleep and REM sleep. Direct injection of 8-OHDPAT or flesinoxan, another 5-HT1A agonist into the DRN, or microdialysis perfusion of 8-OHDPAT into the DRN significantly increases REMS. On the other hand, infusion of 8-OHDPAT into the LDT selectively inhibits REMS, as does direct administration into the DRN of the 5-HT1A receptor antagonists pindolol or WAY 100635. Thus, presently available evidence indicates that selective activation of the somatodendritic 5-HT1A receptor in the DRN induces an increase of REMS. On the other hand, activation of the postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor at the level of the PPT/LDT nuclei decreases REMS occurrence.
