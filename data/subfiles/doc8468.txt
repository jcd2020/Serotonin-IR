	N-(2-(4-(2-Methoxy-phenyl)-1-piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635), labelled in its amido carbonyl group with C-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min), is a promising radioligand for the study of brain 5-HT1A receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). Thus, in PET experiments in six cynomolgus monkeys and seven healthy male volunteers, [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 was taken up avidly by brain, Radioactivity was retained in regions rich in 5-HT1A receptors, such as occipital cortex, temporal cortex and raphe nuclei, but cleared rapidly from cerebellum, a region almost devoid of 5-HT1A receptors. [Carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 provides about 3- and 10-fold higher signal contrast (receptor specific to nonspecific binding) than [O-methyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in receptor-rich areas of monkey and human brain, respectively. To elucidate the effect of label position on radioligand behaviour and to aid in the future biomathematical interpretation of the kinetics of regional cerebral radioactivity uptake in terms of receptor-binding parameters, HPLC was used to measure [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 and its radioactive metabolites in plasma at various times after intravenous injection. Radioactivity cleared rapidly from monkey and human plasma. Parent radioligand represented 19% of the radioactivity in monkey plasma at 47 min and 8% of the radioactivity in human plasma at 40 min. [Carbonyl-C-11]desmethyl-WAY-100635 was below detectable limits in monkey plasma and at most a very minor radioactive metabolite in human plasma. [C-11]Cyclohexanecarboxylic acid was identified as a significant radioactive metabolite. In human plasma this maximally represented 21% of the radioactivity at 10 min after radioligand injection. All other major radioactive metabolites in monkey and human plasma were even more polar. No-carrier-added [carbonyl-C-11]cyclohexanecarboxylic acid was prepared in the laboratory and after intravenous administration into cynomolgus monkey was shown with PET to give only a low uptake of radioactivity into brain tissue. The acid rapidly gave rise to several radioactive metabolites of higher polarity in plasma. The observed lack of any significant metabolism of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 to highly lipophilic or pharmacologically potent radioactive compounds is consistent with its high signal contrast in primate brain.
