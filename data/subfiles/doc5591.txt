	The effect of p-hydroxybenzyl alcohol (HBA) on cycloheximide (CXM)-induced impairment in the step-through passive avoidance task was investigated in rats and compared to the effect of the nootropic piracetam. HBA and piracetam significantly counteracted the CXM induced shortening of retention latencies. The effect of HBA was a bell-shaped dose-response curve with a maximal effect of 5 mg/kg. The counteractive effect of HBA was not depressed by either scopolamine or mecamylamine. The serotonin (5-HT) releaser, p-chloroamphetaminne and presursor, 5-hydroxytryptophan, significantly antagonized the counteractive effect of HBA on the CXM-induced shortening of retention latencies. Furthermore, the counteractive effect was also inhibited by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) and the 5-HT2 receptor agoinst 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2 aminopropane [(+/-)-DOI], but potentiated by the 5-HT1 receptor antagonist (+/-)-pindolol and the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin. There results suggest that the beneficial effect of HBA on CXM-induced impairment is amplified by treatment with serotonergic receptor antagonists but reduced by serotonergic 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor agonists, and insensitive to cholinergic manipulations.
