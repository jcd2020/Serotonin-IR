	In order to explore further the structure-activity relationships of serotonergic and dopaminergic ligands, a series of enantiopure 5-, 7-, or 8-triflate (-OTf)-substituted 2-(monopropylamino)tetralins have been synthesized and evaluated in in vitro binding and in vivo biochemical and behavioral assays in rats. Consequently, the 8-OTf-substituted compound R-(+)-6 was found to be a potent and selective 5-HT1A (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor agonist inducing a full-blown 5-HT syndrome in normal rats, while the corresponding 5-OTf-substituted compound S-(-)-12 was found to be a preferential dopamine (DA) autoreceptor agonist. A partial 5-HT syndrome was also observed for S-(-)-12, while the corresponding R-(+)-12 was found to be inactive at the DA and 5-HT receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Compounds 6 and 12 were found to be major urinary metabolites following oral administration of their dipropyl analogs (2 and 13, respectively). Thus 6 was proposed to be the metabolite responsible for the full-blown 5-HT syndrome seen after oral (but not subcutaneous) administration of 2. Similarly, 12 was proposed to be the metabolite responsible for the partial 5-HT syndrome seen after oral (but not subcutaneous) administration of 13. The bioavailability of R-(+)-6 (7.6 +/- 1.1%) appeared to be slightly lower than that of 2 (11.2 +/- 5.2%), although the in. vitro metabolism of R-(+)-6 appeared to be slower than that of 2. Therefore first-pass metabolism was not thought to be the reason for the lower bioavailability of R-(+)-6, as compared to 2.
