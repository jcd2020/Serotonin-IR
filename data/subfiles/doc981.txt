	Alterations in female gonadal hormones are associated with anxiety and mood changes. The aim of the present study was to determine influences of chronic gonadal hormone supplementation on 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor mRNA levels in the ventral hippocampus and the frontal cerebral cortex. Ovariectomized adult female Sprague-Dawley rats (n=37) received implantation of subcutaneous pellets containing different dosages of 17beta-estradiol alone or in combination with progesterone, or placebo pellets, for 2 weeks. Serotonin receptor mRNA levels were analyzed by in situ hybridization in the ventral hippocampus and 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA also in the frontal cortex. Estradiol treatment in combination with low-dose progesterone increased 5-HT(2A) receptor mRNA by 43% in the CA2 region of the ventral hippocampus, while estradiol combined with high-dose progesterone increased the expression of this gene by 84% in ventral CA1. 5-HT(2A) mRNA expression in the frontal cortex was not influenced by hormone manipulation. 5-HT(2C) receptor gene expression was in the ventral hippocampus decreased in the CA2, ventral CA1 and the subiculum subregions by high-dose estradiol treatment (8-20% decreases). Effects on mood by gonadal hormones can be mediated, at least partly, through influences on 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptor expression.
