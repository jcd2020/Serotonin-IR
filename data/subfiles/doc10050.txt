	There is increasing interest in mapping receptors in vivo by using functional imaging modalities such as single photon emission tomography (SPET) and positron emission tomography (PET). Since SPET is a more accessible functional imaging modality than PET and, overall, it is more economical, radioligands suitable for this technique are in greater demand. Recently, 123I-5-I-R91150, a radioligand with high selectivity and affinity for 5-HT(2A) receptors in the brain, was introduced for SPET. This study reports on the whole-body distribution and brain uptake of the selective 123I-5-I-R91150 ligand in four normal dogs. The frontal to cerebellar ratio of uptake in time was determined in three dogs. Time-activity curve of venous blood was determined in one dog. Maximal global brain uptake was found at 10-60 min post-injection. Higher brain uptake was noted in the frontal cortical areas compared to the cerebellum. The frontal-cerebellar ratio reached the highest values at 90-180 min. Reversibility and pharmacological selectivity of ligand binding was demonstrated through displacement and blocking studies with the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin. This study demonstrates that the specific 5-HT(2A) iodinated ligand can be used for imaging and semi-quantification of the 5-HT(2A) receptors in the canine brain in vivo by using SPET.
