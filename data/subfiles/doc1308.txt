Bonhaus, D. W., et al. (1997). "[3H]RS 57639, a high affinity, selective 5-HT4 receptor partial agonist, specifically labels guinea-pig striatal and rat cloned (5-HT4S and 5-HT4L) receptors." Neuropharmacology 36(4-5): 671-679.

	RS 57639, by being a partial agonist in rat esophagus but a competitive antagonist in guinea-pig ileum, is one of several ligands which operationally discriminate among 5-HT4 receptors in different tissues. The discovery of splice variants of the 5-HT4 receptor, 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L, raises the possibility that this functional heterogeneity among 5-HT4 receptors may be due to differences in the interaction of ligands with different isoforms of the receptor. To test this idea, the functional and binding interactions of RS 57639 with rat 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L receptors were characterized. RS 57639 stimulated adenylate cyclase in cells expressing 5-HT4S or 5-HT4L receptors with similar potency (pEC50 = 7.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.6 +/- 0.1) and efficacy (71 +/- 3 and 59 +/- 4% of 5-HT). [3H]RS 57639 also bound to 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L receptors with similar affinity (Kd = 0.09 +/- 0.01 and 0.11 +/- 0.01 nM) and specificity (SB204070 > GR113808 > SDZ 205557 > cisapride > renzapride > alpha me-5-HT > 5-CT). Therefore, the operational differences among 5-HT4 receptors, detected with RS 57639, are not explained by differences in the interaction of the ligand with 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L receptors. [3H]RS 57639 binding to guinea-pig striatal membranes was also characterized. [3H]RS 57639 bound with high affinity (Kd = 0.25 +/- 0.07 nM) and a specificity similar to that of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, [3H]GR113808. Therefore, while the mechanism by which RS 57639 operationally distinguishes among 5-HT4 receptors was not determined, [3H]RS 57639 was shown to specifically label native and cloned 5-HT4 receptors. As the first selective agonist radioligand to be described for this receptor, [3H]RS 57639 may prove useful in further studies of receptor coupling and ligand interactions.
