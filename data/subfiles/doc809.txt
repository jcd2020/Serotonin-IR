Batman, A. M., et al. (2005). "Attenuation of nicotine's discriminative stimulus effects in rats and its locomotor activity effects in mice by serotonergic 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonists." Psychopharmacology (Berl) 179(2): 393-401.

	Rationale: Reports have indicated that administration of nicotine inhibits, while withdrawal of chronically administered nicotine augments effects of serotonergic 5HT(2A/2C) agonists. Objective: It was our objective to determine whether 5HT(2A/2C) agonists can modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of nicotine in rats or its locomotor activity effects in mice. Methods: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to discriminate 0.3 mg/kg nicotine base from saline in a two-lever, fixed-ratio (FR10), food-reinforced, operant-conditioning task during daily (Monday-Friday) 15-min experimental sessions. After characterizing a dose-response curve for nicotine, we tested the ability of the 5HT(2A/2C) agonists (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCL (DOI; 0.18-1.0 mg/kg) and 1-(4-bromo-2, 5-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOB; 0.1-1.0 mg/kg), the 5HT(2C) agonist 6-chloro-2-(1-piperazinyl)pyrazine hydrochloride (MK 212; 0.1 mg/kg 1.0 mg/kg), and the 5HT(1A) agonist (+/-)-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin hydrobromide (8-OH-DPAT; 0.01 mg/kg 1.0 mg/kg) to modulate nicotine's discriminative stimulus effects. After finding that DOI was able to attenuate the percentage nicotine lever responding (%NLR), we tested for it to also reverse nicotine's effects on locomotor activity in mice. Results: The 5HT(2A/2C) agonists-in particular DOI-dose dependently attenuated %NLR. The effects of DOI were reversed by the 5HT(2A/2C) antagonist ketanserin. MK 212 and 8-OH-DPAT had irregular effects among rats and only reduced %NLR to below 50% levels at doses markedly suppressing responding. DOI also dose dependently blocked nicotine's acute rate-lowering locomotor activity effects. Conclusions: These results indicate that activation of serotonin 5HT(2A/2C) receptors can blunt the discriminative stimulus and locomotor activity effects of nicotine and presents the possibility that activation of these receptors might also be able to attenuate other effects of nicotine.
