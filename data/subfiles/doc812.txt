Ben-Daniel, R., et al. (2008). "Carbon-11 labeled indolylpropylamine analog as a new potential PET agent for imaging of the serotonin transporter." Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry 16(12): 6364-6370.

	The synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a new class of indole derivatives with low-nanomolar affinity for the SERT and high selectivity versus the 5-HT1A receptor were recently reported. Based on their chemical structure, four new indolylpropylamine derivatives which contain atoms to afford future labeling with PET isotopes, were synthesized and evaluated as SERT ligands. The chemistry of these novel derivatives, their biological evaluation, the general method of preparing the precursor indole for labeling, and the C-11 labeling of the most promising indole derivative, are described herein.
