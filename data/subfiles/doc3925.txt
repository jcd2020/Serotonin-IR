Gozlan, H., et al. (1995). "THE SELECTIVE 5-HT1A ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND H-3 WAY-100635 LABELS BOTH G-PROTEIN-COUPLED AND FREE 5-HT1A RECEPTORS IN RAT-BRAIN MEMBRANES." European Journal of Pharmacology-Molecular Pharmacology Section 288(2): 173-186.

	The tritiated derivative of the novel silent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635 [N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide] was tested as a potential radioligand of 5-HT1A receptors in the rat brain. Binding assays with membranes from various brain regions showed that [H-3]WAY 100635 specifically bound to a homogeneous population of sites, with a K-d of 0.10 nM. The regional distribution of [H-3]WAY 100635 specific binding sites, as assessed in membrane binding assays and by autoradiography of labelled brain sections, superimposed exactly over that of 5-HT1A receptors specifically labelled by [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT). Furthermore, the positive correlation (r = 0.96) between the respective pK(i) values of a large series of ligands as inhibitors of the specific binding of [H-3]WAY 100635 and [H-3]8-OH-DPAT in hippocampal membranes indicated that their pharmacological properties were similar. Nevertheless, marked differences also existed between [H-3]8-OH-DPAT and [H-3]WAY 100635 specific binding, as the former was inhibited by 1-100 mu M GTP and GppNHp, whereas the latter was enhanced by these guanine nucleotides. In contrast, Mn2+ (1-10 mM) increased the specific binding of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, but inhibited that of [H-3]WAY 100635. Treatment of membranes with N-ethylmaleimide (1-5 mM) markedly reduced their capacity to specifically bind [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, but slightly increased (at 1 mM) or did not affect (at 5 mM) their [H-3]WAY 100635 specific binding capacity. Finally, the B-max of [H-3]WAY 100635 specific binding sites was regularly 50-60% higher than that of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT in the same membrane preparations from various brain regions (hippocampus, septum, cerebral cortex). These data are compatible with the idea that whereas [H-3]8-OH-DPAT only binds to G-protein-coupled 5-HT1A receptors, [H-3]WAY 100635 is a high affinity ligand of both G-protein-coupled and free 5-HT1A receptor binding subunits in brain membranes.
