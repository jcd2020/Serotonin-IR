Grasby, P. M., et al. (1992). "The putative 5-HT1A antagonist BMY 7378 blocks 8-OH-DPAT-induced changes in local cerebral glucose utilization in the conscious rat." Neuropharmacology 31(6): 547-551.

	It has previously been shown that the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, caused discrete changes in cerebral glucose utilization in the rat, as assessed by quantitative 2-deoxyglucose autoradiography. Here, the effect of the putative 5-HT1A antagonist, BMY 7378, on regional cerebral glucose utilization was examined, when injected alone and in rats treated with 8-OH-DPAT. In control rats, BMY 7378 (5 mg/kg, s.c.) markedly increased glucose utilization in the lateral habenular nucleus and moderately reduced glucose utilization in the hippocampal formation. Pretreatment with BMY 7378 (5 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the reductions in glucose utilization in the hippocampus, entorhinal, piriform and cingulate cortex, induced by 8-OH-DPAT (0.25 mg/kg). The 8-OH-DPAT-induced increase in glucose utilization in the copula pyramis, that is putatively associated with the appearance of the 5-HT behavioural syndrome, was also blocked by BMY 7378, as was the behavioural syndrome. In summary, BMY 7378 produced few of the discrete changes in cerebral glucose utilization that are seen with 8-OH-DPAT. However, many of the changes induced by 8-OH-DPAT were reversed by BMY 7378. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on regional cerebral glucose utilization are mediated by 5-HT1A receptors.
