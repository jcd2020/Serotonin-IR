	Rationale: Defining the mechanism of tolerance development to hallucinogenic drags will help to explain their mechanism of action. Objectives: The present study was conducted to determine first, if tolerance develops to the discriminative stimulus (DS) properties of the hallucinogen, 2,5 dimethoxy-4-iodo-amphetamine (DOI) and second, the mechanism mediating tolerance. 5 Methods: Rats were trained to discriminate 0.75 mg/kg DOI from saline on a concurrent VI-30-min schedule of reinforcement with a 15-min time-out for incorrect responses. To evaluate tolerance development, rats were assigned to one of four groups and treated with either chronic saline or chronic DOL Prior to chronic treat; ment, two groups were tested for choice behavior following vehicle administration while the remaining two groups were tested following the administration of 0.375 mg/kg DOI. One group from each pre-test condition was injected with either saline or DOI (1 mg/kg) for 8 days. Twenty-four hours after the last chronic injection the pre-test treatments were replicated. Using receptor autoradiography, the density of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors was measured in independent groups of rats that had received identical treatment conditions. Results: Animals receiving chronic DOI showed a 60% decrease in DOI lever responding (from 100% to 40%) when tested on 0.375 mg/kg DOI, while animals receiving chronic saline showed no change in percent choice (100%) on the DOI lever. Significant changes in binding were observed in 5-HT2A receptors but not 5-HT2C receptors. The results of tests with antagonists were consistent with the changes in binding. Conclusions: These results suggest that behavioral tolerance to DOI reflects neuroadaptive changes in 5-HT2A receptors.
