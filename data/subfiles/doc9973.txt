Schmaljohann, J., et al. (2004). "Radiosynthesis and in vitro evaluation of the 5HT(2) receptor ligand N-C-11-methyl -1- 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl -2-methylaminopropane for PET." Radiochimica Acta 92(4-6): 345-348.

	In vivo labelling of serotonergic receptors (5HT) could be a useful tool for understanding the physiological and pathophysiological role of neurodegenerative disorders. 1-[2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl]-2-aminopropane (DOI), a well known agonist with high affinity to 5-HT2, receptors, was labelled with C-11 for PET. Here we report the evaluation of the mono-methylated and dimethylated analogs of DOI for PET. The syntheses of [N-C-11-methyl]-DOI ([C-11]MDOI) and [N-C-11-dimethyl]-DOI ([C-11]DMDOI) were optimized resulting in radiochemical yields of up to 43%, allowing efficient production for clinical use. High affinities for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors with a slight preference for 5-HT2A,, were found for MDOI, similar to the highly potent hallucinogen DOI.
