	The effects of two serotonergic (5-HT1A) receptor agonists (8-OH-DPAT; 0.01, 0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg, s.c., and Indorenate; 1, 3, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) were evaluated in three type of seizures in male Wistar rats: clonic-tonic convulsions induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 60 mg/kg, i.p.), status epilepticus (SE) of limbic seizures produced by kainic acid (KA, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) and tonic-clonic seizures by amygdala kindling. 8-OH-DPAT decreased the incidence of tonic seizures and the mortality rate induced by PTZ. Indorenate increased the latency to the PTZ-induced seizures and decreased the percentage of rats showing tonic extension and death. Concerning KA, 8-OH-DPAT augmented the latency and reduced the frequency of wet-dog shake (WDS) and generalized seizure (GS). At high doses it diminished the occurrence and delayed the establishment of SE. Indorenate augmented the latency to WDS, GS and SE, and diminished the number of GS. 8-OH-DPAT and Indorenate did not alter the expression of kindled seizures. However, Indorenate enhanced the refractoriness to subsequent seizures during the postictal depression. Some effects induced by 8-OH-DPAT and Indorenate On seizures evaluated and postictal depression were fully or partially blocked by WAY 100635. These results suggest that 5-HT1A receptor agonists modify epileptic activity depending on the type of seizure. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
