Ye, J. H., et al. (1997). "Ondansetron modulates GABA(A) current of rat central nervous system neurons." Eur J Pharmacol 337(1): 87-94.

	We examined the effect of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, on the whole cell current response of freshly isolated hypothalamic and hippocampal neurons of rats to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The nystatin perforated patch technique was used to minimize run-down of the GABA current. While 1-150 microM ondansetron had no effect on membrane conductance, co-application with agonist reversibly depressed the maximal end GABA current. The concentration-response relation of GABA reveals a non-competitive mechanism. However, the inhibitory effect was more potent when ondansetron was co-applied with lower concentrations of GABA: i.e., the ondansetron concentration needed to depress the current induced by 5 microM GABA to half amplitude was 7 microM compared to 28 microM for the current induced by 10 microM GABA. Analysis of the current-voltage relationship with and without ondansetron indicated that the effect of ondansetron is not voltage dependent. Current-voltage relations also showed that the effect of ondansetron was not due to activation of a GABA-independent current because the reversal potentials were the same with and without ondansetron. The present data suggest that ondansetron's suppression of GABA-activated current may be the molecular basis of ondansetron-induced seizures observed in vivo.
