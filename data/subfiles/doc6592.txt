LÃ³pez-Meraz, M. L., et al. (2007). "Effect of 8-OH-DPAT on electrographic activity during the kainic acid-induced status epilepticus in rats." Seizure 16(4): 365-370.

	The effect of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, on electrographic activity during the kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus (SE) was evaluated in male Wistar rats. Electrographic (EEG) recordings from the ventral hippocampus and the frontal cortex along with behavioral changes were evaluated in animals that received KA administration (10mg/kg, i.p.) 20 min after saline solution (control group) or 8-OH-DPAT (1mg/kg, s.c.) injection. Rats pretreated with 8-OH-DPAT presented augmented latency for wet dog shakes (71%), generalized seizures (54%) and behavioral SE (31%). 8-OH-DPAT delayed occurrence of the first KA-induced paroxystic spikes (70%), increased latency to the EEG SE (39%) and decreased spike frequency (35-43%) recorded from the frontal cortex, and increased the time necessary for the high voltage EEG activity synchronization of the hippocampus and the frontal cortex (125%). However, EEG ictal activity recorded in hippocampus was not modified after 8-OH-DPAT pretreatment. These results indicate that 8-OH-DPAT reduces the EEG activity associated with the KA-induced SE in the frontal cortex, but not the hippocampus, and suggest an inhibitory effect in the propagation of epileptic seizures during the KA-induced SE.
