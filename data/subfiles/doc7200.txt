	Sulphate (SO42-) is conjugated to numerous enclogenous compounds, including serotonin (5-HT). The NaSl sulphate transporter is primarily expressed in the kidney, where it maintains blood SO42- concentrations. Previously, we generated NaSl null (Nasl(-/-)) mice, which have hyposulphataemia and decreased anxiety and locomotor activity In this study, we investigated 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA) concentrations, and 5-HT receptor mRNA levels. Nasl(-/-) mice exhibited a doubling in blood 5-HT concentration, but a 12% reduction in brain levels of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid. Brain 5-HTIA and 5-HTIB receptor mRNA levels were increased by 50%, compared with wild-type mice. Our data indicate that decreased circulating SO42- concentrations modulate 5-HT neurotransmitter and receptor levels, in a manner consistent with the behavioural phenotypes of Nasl(-/-) mice.
