Angel, I., et al. (1993). "Litoxetine: a selective 5-HT uptake inhibitor with concomitant 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and antiemetic properties." Eur J Pharmacol 232(2-3): 139-145.

	The selective 5HT uptake inhibitor, litoxetine (SL 81.0385), currently under development as an antidepressant was shown to have antiemetic properties in the ferret. Litoxetine (at 1 and 10 mg/kg i.v.) dose dependently reduced the number of retches and vomiting as well as the number of emetic episodes induced by cisplatin (10 mg/kg i.v.) and delayed the onset of emesis. Fluoxetine (at 1 or 10 mg/kg i.v.) failed to inhibit cisplatin-induced emetic responses and, in contrast, significantly increased the number of retches and vomiting and accelerated the onset of emesis. The possibility that the antiemetic effects of litoxetine may be mediated through an interaction with 5HT3 receptors was studied using [3H]quipazine or [3H]BRL 43694 to label the 5HT3 receptor. Litoxetine has moderate affinity for cerebral 5HT3 receptors (Ki = 85 nM), while fluoxetine, similar to other 5HT uptake inhibitors, has only negligible affinity for this receptor (Ki = 6.5 microM). It is proposed that litoxetine inhibits cisplatin-induced emetic responses due to its moderate 5HT3 antagonist properties. The clinical use of the majority of serotonergic antidepressants (e.g. fluoxetine, fluvoxamine etc.) is associated with gastrointestinal discomfort (particularly nausea and vomiting) as a major side-effect. If nausea and vomiting associated with the use of 5 HT uptake inhibitors are due to stimulation of 5HT3 receptors, the concomitant 5HT3 antagonism of litoxetine may limit the gastrointestinal side-effects of this novel antidepressant and thus offer an important advantage.
