Applegate, C. D. and L. H. Tecott (1998). "Global increases in seizure susceptibility in mice lacking 5-HT2C receptors: a behavioral analysis." Exp Neurol 154(2): 522-530.

	Previous studies have shown that mice bearing a targeted disruption of the 5-HT2C receptor gene exhibit an epilepsy syndrome associated with sporadic spontaneous seizures that occasionally result in death. In this study, we have defined the seizure susceptibility profiles of these 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background. Wild-type and mutant animals were either electrically kindled from the olfactory bulb, exposed to corneal electroshock, or tested with the chemoconvulsant, flurothyl. In all paradigms, mice lacking the 5-HT2C receptor were significantly more seizure susceptible than wild-type controls. Results indicate that mutants have lower focal seizure thresholds, increased focal seizure excitability, and facilitated propagation within the forebrain seizure system. Mutants also exhibit lower generalized seizure thresholds for the expression of both generalized clonic and generalized tonic seizures. Importantly, the 5-HT receptor antagonist, mesulergine (2 or 4 mg/kg), administered prior to electroshock testing, recapitulated the mutant phenotype in wild-type mice. Together, these data strongly implicate a role for serotonin and 5-HT2C receptors in the modulation of neuronal network excitability and seizure propagation globally, throughout the CNS.
