Sanchez, C. (1995). "SEROTONERGIC MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN THE EXPLORATORY-BEHAVIOR OF MICE IN A FULLY AUTOMATED 2-COMPARTMENT BLACK-AND-WHITE TEST BOX." Pharmacol Toxicol 77(1): 71-78.

	A fully automated version of the black and white two-compartment box for mice is presented. The anxiolytic-like effects of the benzodiazepines, diazepam and chlordiazepoxide, were confirmed, and the involvement of serotonergic mechanisms was studied in this animal model of anxiety. The partial 5-HT1A receptor agonists, buspirone and ipsapirone showed anxiolytic-like effects in a limited dose interval. The full agonist hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetraline (8-OH-DPAT) was inactive. The non-selective 5-HT1 receptor agonist, eltoprazine, induced marked increases of exploratory behaviour in the white compartment over a broad range of doses. Also pindolol a mixed 5-HT1A/1B and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist showed anxiolytic-like effects, whereas another compound with a similar profile (-)-, penbutolol and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551, was inactive. The 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, ritanserin, showed anxiogenic-like, and the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, zacopride and ondansetron, showed anixiolytic-like effects. An overall increase of serotonergic activity by means of 5-HT uptake inhibition (citalopram), 5-HT release (fenfluramine) or administration of a 5-HT precursor (1-5-HTP) facilitated exploratory activity in the white compartment. Reduction of serotonergic activity by treatment with the 5-HT depletor p-chloro-phenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA) did not change the exploratory behaviour, but attenuated the response to fenfluramine significantly.
