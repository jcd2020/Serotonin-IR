	Previously, it has been reported that modulating serotonergic neurones by use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) can alter the hypothermic response produced by Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect that activation or antagonism of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT(1A)) receptors has on Delta(9)-THC-induced hypothermia. Delta(9)-THC (0.5, 2 and 5 mg/kg iv) decreased body temperature in a dose-related manner. Whilst having no significant effect on body temperature when administered 40 min prior to vehicle injection, the 5-HT(1A) receptor antagonist N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride (WAY 100635; 1 mg/kg sc) significantly potentiated the hypothermia produced by 2 and 5 mg/kg Delta(9)-THC. In order to investigate whether this effect was due to antagonism at somatodendritic autoreceptors in midbrain raphe nuclei, WAY 100635 or the 5-HT(1A) agonist 8-hydroxy-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) was microinjected into either the median raphe nuclei (MRN) or dorsal raphe nuclei (DRN) 40 min prior to Delta(9)-THC injection. Following microinjection into the DRN, neither WAY 100635 (0.5 nmol/0.5 microl/10 s) nor 8-OH-DPAT (15.2 nmol/0.5 microl/10 s) had any significant effect on Delta(9)-THC-induced hypothermia. However, WAY 100635 when microinjected into the MRN significantly potentiated Delta(9)-THC-induced hypothermia, and 8-OH-DPAT microinjected into the MRN significantly inhibited Delta(9)-THC-induced hypothermia. It is suggested from these studies that the potentiation of Delta(9)-THC-induced hypothermia by WAY 100635 when administered peripherally is mainly due to antagonism at somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors in the MRN.
