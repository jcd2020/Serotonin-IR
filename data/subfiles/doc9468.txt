Riva, M. A. and I. Creese (1989). "Comparison of two putatively selective radioligands for labeling central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptors: inadequacy of [3H]dihydroalprenolol." Mol Pharmacol 36(1): 201-210.

	[3H]Dihydroalprenolol ([3H]DHA) has been used extensively in receptor binding studies to measure beta-adrenergic receptors in the central nervous system. Usually, nonspecific binding has been defined by high concentrations of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol or antagonists such as alprenolol or propranolol. Scatchard plots of such "specific" [3H]DHA saturation data in rat cerebral cortex membranes are linear. However, computer analysis demonstrated that the competition curves of these drugs for 2.0 nM [3H]DHA binding are biphasic, with a continuous inhibition of [3H]DHA binding in the concentration range usually used to determine nonspecific binding. These data indicate that another saturable high affinity site was being labeled by the radioligand and that the definition of nonspecific binding with any of these unlabeled drugs is not satisfactory. We used the nonlinear, least squares, curve-fitting program LIGAND to analyze total [3H]DHA binding, allowing the program to mathematically define nonspecific binding as a function of 3H-ligand concentration. Significantly lower Bmax (-44%) and Kd (-58%) values for beta-adrenergic receptors were found, indicating that under normal experimental procedures (defining [3H]DHA non-specific binding with these nonradioactive drugs) a second binding site was being labeled. We found that [3H]DHA binding to this site could be inhibited by drugs such as RU24969, a 5-hydroxytryptamine1A (5HT1A) and 5HT1B receptor subtype-selective agonist, and CGS12066B, a 5HT1B receptor subtype-selective agonist, which were able to compete for 15-20% of [3H]DHA binding in the nanomolar concentration range, whereas drugs that are selective for other serotonin receptor subtypes inhibited [3H]DHA binding only at much higher concentrations. Another beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist radioligand, [3H]CGP-12177, was found to be more selective for beta-adrenergic receptors. Alprenolol competition curves for [3H]CGP-12177 binding were monophasic and saturation curves, with nonspecific binding defined either by 10 microM alprenolol or by LIGAND, yielded Bmax values close to those obtained with [3H]DHA when its nonspecific binding was defined by LIGAND. [3H]DHA cannot be considered a suitable radioligand to quantify central nervous system beta-adrenergic receptors in the manner in which it has been typically used.
