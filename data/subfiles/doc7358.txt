Merzak, A., et al. (1996). "Expression of serotonin receptors in human fetal astrocytes and glioma cell lines: A possible role in glioma cell proliferation and migration." Molecular Brain Research 41(1-2): 1-7.

	Expression of seven serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors (5-HT1D alpha, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1C, 5-HT1D beta, and 5-HT6) was investigated in human normal fetal astrocytes and eight glioma cell lines by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). No expression of 5-HT1D beta and 5-HT6 was observed in any of the cell lines studied. The 5-HT1D alpha receptor was found to be expressed in two human glioma cell lines but not in normal astrocytes. In addition, only three glioma cell lines expressed the 5-HT1E receptor. The 5-HT1C receptor was expressed in six glioma cell lines but not in normal astrocytes while the 5-HT1A was found to be expressed in normal astrocytes from the left hemisphere and in six glioma cell lines but not in normal astrocytes from the cerebellum. Interestingly, the 5-HT2 receptor was expressed in all cells studied but very weakly in normal astrocytes. The effect of 5-HT on glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was also investigated. Serotonin was found to positively modulate these three processes in vitro. These results suggest that 5-HT may play an important role in the control of the biological properties of human glioma cells.
