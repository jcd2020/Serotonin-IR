	Electrically evoked release of serotonin (5-HT) and its modulation via 5-HT autoreceptors and alpha(2)-heteroreceptors was studied in primary cell cultures prepared from the embryonic (ED 15) rat mesencephalic brain region comprising the raphe nuclei. Cultures were grown for up to 3 weeks on circular glass coverslips. They developed a dense network of non-neuronal and neuronal cells, some of which were positive for tryptophan hydroxylase. To measure 5-HT release, the cultures were pre-incubated with [H-3]5-HT (in the presence of the selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor oxaprotiline [1 mu mol/L]), superfused with modified Krebs-Henseleit medium containing 6-nitroqipazine [1 mu mol/L] and electrically stimulated using two conditions. Condition A: 360 pulses, 3 Hz, 0.5 ms, 90 mA, or condition B: 4 pulses 100 Hz, 0.5 ms, 90 mA (a condition which diminishes interactions with endogenously released transmitters during ongoing stimulation). After only 1 week in culture, the electrically evoked overflow of [H-3] was Ca2+ dependent and tetrodotoxin sensitive, suggesting an action-potential-induced exocytotic release of 5-HT. Using stimulation condition A in cultures grown for 2 weeks, both basal and evoked 5-HT release were strongly enhanced by methiotepine (1 mu mol/L) but unaffected by the 5-HT1B autoreceptor agonist CP-93, 129 (1 mu mol/L) and the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist UK-14, 304 (1 mu mol/L). Conversely, using stimulation condition B, not only CP-93, 129 (IC50 8.1 +/- 1.4 nmol/L) and UK-14, 304 (IC50 14.9 +/- 1.6 nmol/L) had inhibitory effects on cells grown for 2 weeks, but also the 5-HT1A agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. In conclusion, we describe for the first time electrically evoked release of 5-HT from primary cultures of fetal raphe cells and its modulation via 5-HT1B and 5-HT1A auto- and alpha(2)-heteroreceptors. Such cultured raphe cells may represent a suitable model to study expression and development of presynaptic receptors on serotonergic neurons in-vitro.
