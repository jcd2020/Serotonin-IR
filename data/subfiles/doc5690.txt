Kitaichi, K., et al. (1999). "Involvement of the serotonergic neuronal system in phencyclidine-induced place aversion in rats." Behavioural Brain Research 103(1): 105-111.

	The possible involvement of the serotonergic neuronal system in aversive motivation produced by phencyclidine [1-(l-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine; PCP] was investigated using a place-conditioning paradigm in rats. PCP (4 mg/kg, i.p.) produced place aversion in this task as reported previously (Kitaichi K, Noda Y, Hasegawa T, Furukawa H, Nabeshima T. Acute phencyclidine induces aversion, but repeated phencyclidine induces preference in the place conditioning test in rats. fur J Pharmacol 1996,318:7-9). The blockade of serotonin,, (5-HT2A) receptors using the antagonist ritanserin (3 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated this aversive property of PCP whereas lesions of serotonergic neurons using 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT, 100 mu g/animal, i.c.v.) failed to affect it. Repeated PCP treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p. for 14 days), which is enough to diminish the stereotyped 5-MT2A receptor-mediated head-twitch behavior, also decreased the place aversion. These results suggest that the serotonergic neuronal system, specifically the 5-MT2A receptor, may play a critical role in producing PCP-induced place aversion. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.
