	The [3H]ketanserin binding characteristics in the apomorphine-induced aggressive and nonaggressive adult male Wistar rats were studied. Repeated apomorphine (0.5 mg/kg, once daily) treatment gradually induced aggressive behaviour in sixteen animals from twenty. Thereafter the animals were retrospectively divided into apomorphine-induced aggressive and nonaggressive group. The maximal number of the [3H]ketanserin binding sites was increased in the apomorphine-treated animals in the frontal (233.9+/-26.5, 364.6+/-31.7, and 367.0+/-34.8 fmol/mg protein for the vehicle, apomorphine-nonaggressive, and apomorphine-aggressive group, respectively) and cerebral cortex (164.2+/-6.7, 289.7+/-29.3, and 249.0+/-15.4 fmol/mg protein for the vehicle, apomorphine-nonaggressive, and apomorphine-aggressive group, respectively). In conclusion, our experiments demonstrate that repeated apomorphine treatment upregulates the maximal number of the 5-HT2A receptors in rat frontal and cerebral cortex as measured by [3H]ketanserin binding and this phenomenon is independent from the development of aggressive behaviour.
