	The mechanism responsible for the antihypertensive effect of urapidil is not yet completely understood. Its vasodilator action has been attributed to an antagonism at vascular alpha 1-adrenoceptors. However, it has been suggested that a central action contributes to the hypotensive effect. Recently, three potent analogues of urapidil have been described which also lower blood pressure by a central mechanism. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT1A subtype have been implicated with the central control of cardiovascular function. In the present study, the affinities of these urapidil derivatives (5-acetyl, 5-formyl- and 5-methyl-urapidil) for 5-HT receptors were investigated using 3H-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propyl-amino)tetralin (3H-8-OH-DPAT), 125I-iodocyanopindolol (125I-ICYP) and 3H-ketanserin for labelling 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2 binding sites, respectively. 3H-Prazosin and 3H-clonidine were used as selective alpha 1- and alpha 2-adrenoceptor radioligands, respectively. Urapidil and its analogues produced half-maximum inhibition of 3H-8-OH-DPAT binding at concentrations of 4 x 10(-9) mol/l to 4 x 10(-7) mol/l with the following order of potency: urapidil less than 5-acetyl- less than or equal to 5-formyl- less than 5-methyl-urapidil. Thus, 5-methyl-urapidil is one of the most potent ligands at 5-HT1A recognition sites known to date. The IC50 values of urapidil and its derivatives for 3H-prazosin binding were in the range of 5 x 10(-8) mol/l to 8 x 10(-7) mol/l (order of potency: urapidil less than 5-formyl- less than 5-acetyl- less than 5-methyl-urapidil).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
