Hirokawa, Y., et al. (2002). "Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 4-amino-5-chloro-N-(1,4-dialkylhexahydro-1,4-diazepin-6-yl)-2-methoxyben zamide derivatives, novel and potent serotonin 5-HT3 and dopamine D-2 receptors dual antagonist." Chemical & Pharmaceutical Bulletin 50(7): 941-959.

	In search of a dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5-HT3 receptors dual antagonist as a potential broad antiemetic agent, a number of benzamides were prepared from 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid derivatives and 6-amino-1,4-dialkylhexahydro-1,4-diazepines and evaluated for their binding affinity for the dopamine D-2 and the serotonin 5-HT3 receptors using rat brain synaptic and rat cortical membranes, respectively. From the results of both in vitro receptor binding and in vivo biological assays for the dopamine D-2 receptor, 1-ethyl-4-methylhexahydro-1,4-diazepine ring was selected as an optimum amine moiety. Introduction of one methyl group on the nitrogen atom at the 4-position and/or modification of the substituent at the 5-position of the 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoyl moiety caused a marked increase in the dopamine D-2 receptor binding affinity along with a potent 5-HT3 receptor binding affinity. Among the compounds, 5-chloro-N-(1-ethyl-4-methylhexahydro-1,4-diazepin-6-yl)-2-methoxy-4-methylaminobenzamide (82), 5-bromo (110), and 5-iodo (112) analogues exhibited a much higher affinity for the dopamine D-2 receptor than that of metoclopramide (IC50 = 17.5-61.0 nM vs. 483 nM). In particular, 82 showed a potent antagonistic activity for both receptors in vivo tests. Optical resolution of the racemate 82 brought about a dramatic change in the pharmacological profile with the (R)-enantiomer exhibiting a strong affinity for both the dopamine D-2 and the 5-HT3 receptors, while the corresponding (S)-enantiomer had a potent and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor binding affinity.
