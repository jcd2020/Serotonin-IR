	Repeated administration of methamphetamine (METH) elicits a progressive enhancement of locomotor activity known as behavioral sensitization. We have recently shown that osemozotan (previously called MKC-242), a selective serotonin (5-HT)(1A) receptor agonist, inhibited methamphetamine (METH)-induced locomotor sensitization in mice. To clarify the neurochemical mechanisms by which METH induces behavioral sensitization, the present study examined, using in vivo microdialysis technique, the effects of repeated METH administration on the METH challenge-induced release of 5-HT, dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) in mouse brain. A single injection of METH increased the release of all monoamines in the prefrontal cortex and striatum. Osemozotan increased DA release and decrease 5-HT, but not DA and NA, in the prefrontal cortex oof untreated mice and these effects were less potent in METH-pretreated mice, suggesting the reduced sensitivity of 5-HT1A receptors. Chronic administration of osemozotan to METH-pretreated mice reversed the increased response of 5-HT release in the prefrontal cortex, as observed in behavioral sensitization. These effects were antagonized by WAY100635, selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. These findings suggest that the increase response of the 5-HT system to METH challenge plays a key role in behavior sensitization in mice.
