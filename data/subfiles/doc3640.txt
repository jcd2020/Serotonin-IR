Feldman, P. D. and F. J. Galiano (1995). "Cardiovascular effects of serotonin in the nucleus of the solitary tract." Am J Physiol 269(1 Pt 2): R48-56.

	The cardiovascular regulatory role of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] in the solitary tract nucleus (NTS) was investigated in urethan-anesthetized Wistar rats. Unilateral microinjection of 5-HT (5 nmol in 50 nl) into the NTS evoked depressions of both arterial pressure (-20 +/- 1 mmHg) and heart rate (-43 +/- 6 beats/min). Induction of bradycardia and hypotension was repeatable and consistently obtained with injections into the NTS but not into neighboring structures. Microinjection of the nonselective 5-HT receptor antagonist methiothepin or the 5-HT1A/5-HT1B antagonist pindolol prevented any cardiovascular change by subsequent microinjection of 5-HT into the NTS. In contrast, microinjection of the 5-HT2-selective antagonist ketanserin or the 5-HT1A antagonist spiroxatrine had no effect on the subsequent effects of 5-HT. Bilateral vagal denervation prevented the bradycardia induced by 5-HT, whereas the vasodepression remained intact. These data provide evidence that 5-HT in the NTS evokes vagal chronotropic cardioinhibition and sympathetic withdrawal and suggest that this action is mediated by 5-HT1 serotonergic receptors, possibly of the 5-HT1B subtype.
