Gartside, S. E., et al. (1992). "EFFECT OF 5-HYDROXY-L-TRYPTOPHAN ON THE RELEASE OF 5-HT IN RAT HYPOTHALAMUS INVIVO AS MEASURED BY MICRODIALYSIS." Neuropharmacology 31(1): 9-14.

	The effect of systemic administration of the 5-HT precursor, 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (5-HTP) on the release of 5-HT in the lateral hypothalamus of the chloral hydrate-anaesthetized rat in vivo was examined using brain microdialysis. Administration of 5-HTP caused an immediate increase of 5-HT in dialysates, which was long lasting (greater-than-or-equal-to 140 min) and dose-dependent (30-100 mg/kg i.p.). When calcium was omitted from the perfusion medium, thereby limiting exocytosis, levels of basal 5-HT were significantly decreased and the 5-HTP-induced response of 5-HT was markedly attenuated. Administration of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (0.25 mg/kg i.p.), which selectively inhibits serotoninergic neuronal activity by activation of the somatodendritic 5-HT autoreceptor, significantly decreased basal levels of 5-HT and markedly attenuated the 5-HTP-induced increase in 5-HT. The data demonstrate that systemic administration of 5-HTP caused an increase in the release of 5-HT in the hypothalamus. Furthermore, this release occurred by a calcium-dependent mechanism (probably exocytosis), was dependent on serotoninergic neuronal activity and predominantly derived from 5-HT neurones. The findings are discussed in relation to the behavioural and neuroendocrine effects of increasing availability of the 5-HT precursor.
