Lovinger, D. M. (1991). "INHIBITION OF 5-HT3 RECEPTOR-MEDIATED ION CURRENT BY DIVALENT METAL-CATIONS IN NCB-20 NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS." J Neurophysiol 66(4): 1329-1337.

	1. The effect of micromolar concentrations of divalent metal cations on ion current activated by 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was investigated in NCB-20 neuroblastoma cells by the use of the whole-cell, patch-clamp technique. 2. Ion current activated by 5-HT in these cells was mimicked by 5-HT3 receptor agonists, blocked by nanomolar concentrations of selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and reversed polarity at approximately 0 mV. These properties indicate that this current is carried primarily if not exclusively by the nonspecific cation channel activated by the 5-HT3 receptor. 3. The Group IIb metal cations Cd2+ and Zn2+ and the Group Ib cation Cu2+ inhibited 5-HT-activated current with inhibition increasing in a concentration-dependent manner over micromolar concentrations of the ions. The order of potency of the ions for inhibiting 5-HT-activated current was Zn2+ (IC50 = 20-mu-M) greater-than-or-equal-to Cu2+ (IC50 = 25-mu-M) > Cd2+ (IC50 = 75-mu-M) at -50 mV. The other divalent metal cations tested (Ba2+, Co2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, and Ni2+) produced little or no inhibition of 5-HT-activated current at concentrations up to 200-mu-M. 4. Inhibition of 5-HT-activated current by Cd2+ and Zn2+ was dependent on membrane potential with the Kd increasing e-fold per 72 and 52 mV, respectively. Inhibition by Cu2+ was much less voltage dependent with the Kd increasing e-fold per 233 mV. 5. Inhibition by all three cations decreased with increasing concentration of agonist over a range of 5-HT concentrations from 1 to 10-mu-M. The apparent potency of 5-HT was reduced by all three cations. 6. These observations indicate that certain divalent metal cations are potent inhibitors of ion current mediated by 5-HT3 receptors. The action of these cations appears to decrease the affinity of 5-HT for its recognition site. Inhibition by Cd2+ and Zn2+ may take place at a site within the receptor-linked nonspecific cation channel. Alternatively, these cations may interact with a conformation of the receptor that is preferentially adopted at negative membrane potentials. Inhibition by CU2+ does not appear to result from an action within the channel and may result from an action on the extracellular surface of the receptor.
