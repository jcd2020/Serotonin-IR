	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The 5-ht1E receptor is highly expressed in the human brain and its structure is conserved in humans, suggesting an important physiological role for 5-ht1E receptors. However, neither the function nor the distribution of this receptor has been characterized in the mammalian brain. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Rats and mice lack the 5-ht1E receptor gene; thus, we used guinea pig brain tissue and immunofluorescent staining techniques to provide the first specific localization of 5-ht1E receptors in the mammalian brain. KEY RESULTS High levels of 5-ht1E receptors are detected in olfactory bulb glomeruli as well as the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG). In DG membranes, BRL54443, a 5-ht1E/5-HT1F agonist, selectively stimulated 5-ht1E receptors and potently inhibited forskolin-dependent cAMP production (IC50= 14 nM). The staining pattern of 5-ht1E receptors in brain tissue suggests that this receptor is expressed predominantly in neurons rather than in glia. Additionally, 5-ht1E receptors were detected in the adventitial layer of cerebral arteries but not in the microvasculature, venous tissue or other brain arteries. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These observations should help to predict clinical effects of 5-ht1E-selective drugs. For example, the stimulation of 5-ht1E receptors and subsequent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity in the DG suggests that 5-ht1E receptors may mediate regulation of hippocampal activity by 5-HT, making it a possible drug target for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by memory deficits (such as Alzheimer's disease) or as a target for the treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy.
