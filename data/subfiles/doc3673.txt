	In the present series of experiments we compared the effect of injecting serotonin (40-mu-g/cannula), the 5-HT1A agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) (5.0-mu-g/cannula), and the 5-HT1B/C agonist, trifluoromethyl-phenyl-piperazine (TFMPP) (1.0-mu-g/cannula), into the preoptic area, the nucleus accumbens and the nucleus raphe dorsalis. The dose injected was selected on the basis of dose response curves. Injection of serotonin and TFMPP into the medial preoptic area and nucleus accumbens resulted in an inhibition of male sexual behaviour, as evidenced by an increase in the number of mounts and a prolongation of the ejaculation latency. Injection of 8-OH-DPAT into these brain areas facilitated copulatory behaviour as evidenced by a reduction in the number of mounts, intromissions and ejaculation latency. Administration of these compounds into the nucleus raphe dorsalis produced no effect, except for a prolongation of the intromission latency after serotonin. These results would suggest that at least some of the 5-HT1A receptors involved in the facilitation of male sexual behaviour are located postsynaptically in limbic brain areas that regulate male sexual behaviour. On the basis of the similarities between the inhibitory effects of serotonin and TFMPP, the present results further support the idea that endogenous serotonin acts via the stimulation of 5-HT1D receptors to inhibit male sexual behaviour.
