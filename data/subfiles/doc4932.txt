Hutson, P. H., et al. (1987). "Hypothermia induced by the putative 5-HT1A agonists LY165163 and 8-OH-DPAT is not prevented by 5-HT depletion." Eur J Pharmacol 143(2): 221-228.

	The putative 5-HT1A agonist 1-[2-(4-aminophenyl)ethyl]-4-(3-trifluoromethylphenyl)piperazine (LY165163, PAPP) (1, 2, 4, 10 mg/kg s.c.) caused a significant and dose-dependent hypothermia in rats, 30 and 60 min after injection. The decreases of temperature were less marked than that caused by 8-OH-DPAT 1 mg/kg s.c.). Depletion of brain serotonin (5-HT) by 91% following pretreatment with p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) (150 mg/kg i.p. on three successive days) significantly enhanced the hypothermic effects of both 8-OH-DPAT (0.25 mg/kg s.c.) and LY165163 (4 mg/kg s.c.). LY165163-induced hypothermia was also somewhat enhanced following depletion of hypothalamic 5-HT by 76% after infusion of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) (150 micrograms) into the third ventricle. Results indicate that the hypothermia induced by the putative 5-HT1A agonists LY165163 and 8-OH-DPAT in the rat is not dependent on presynaptic 5-HT stores and is therefore probably mediated by postsynaptic 5-HT receptors.
