	The present investigation explored the modulatory role of serotonergic transmission in the acute ethanol-induced effects on immobility time in the mouse forced swim test (FST). Acute i.p. administration of ethanol (20% w/v, 2 or 2.5 g/kg, i.p.) decreased the immobility time in FST of mice, indicating its antidepressant-like effect while lower doses of ethanol (1, 1.5 g/kg, i.p.) were devoid of any effect in the FST. The mice pre-treated with a sub-effective dose of 5-HT2A agonist, DOI (10 mu g/mouse, i.c.v.) or 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, WAY 100635 (0.1 mu g/mouse, i.c.v.) but not with the 5-HT2A/2C antagonist, ketanserin (1.5 mu g/mouse, i.c.v.) exhibited a synergistic reduction in the immobility time induced by sub-effective dose of ethanol (1.5 g/kg, i.p.). On the other hand, ethanol (2.5 g/kg, i.p.) failed to decrease the immobility time in mice, pre-treated with 5-HT1A agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (0.1 mu g/mouse, i.c.v.) or ketanserin (1.5 mu g/mouse, i.c.v.). In addition, pre-treatment with a 5-HT neuronal synthesis inhibitor, p-CPA (300 mg/kg, i.p. x 3 days) attenuated the anti-immobility effect ethanol (2.5 g/kg, i.p.) in mouse FST. Thus, the results of the present study points towards the essentiality of the central 5-HT transmission at the synapse for the ethanol-induced antidepressant-like effect in the FST wherein the regulatory role of the 5-HT1A receptor or contributory role of the 5-HT2A/2C receptor-mediated mechanism is proposed in the anti-immobility effect of acute ethanol in mouse FST.
