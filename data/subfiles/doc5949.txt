	The last ten years have witnessed the generation of a large amount of information on the neurobiology of dopamine receptors. Molecular biology and pharmacology studies have revealed existence of at least five dopamine receptor subtypes. namely D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-5. The discovery of D-4 receptors and the putative affinity of clozapine for D-4 receptors have kindled development of selective D-4 receptor, antagonists For the treatment of schizophrenia. Studies on expression of D-4, receptor proteins have shown selective localisation of D-4, receptors in mesolimbic/mesocortical areas which could probably explain the lack of motor side effects with atypical antipsychotics like clozapine and olanzapine. However, neuropathological and genetic studies on the role of D-4, receptors in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and preliminary clinical studies with selective D-4 receptor antagonists have been disappointing. There have been, however, complimentary findings between selective D-4, receptor antagonism and genetic approaches such as antisense treatment or gene targeting. The therapeutic potential of D-4, receptors as a target for developing antipsychotics will be known only when selective D-4 receptor antagonists with varying D-2/D-4 and D-4/5-HT2A ratios are developed and tested in psychiatric patients.
