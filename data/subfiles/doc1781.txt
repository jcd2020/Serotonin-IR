Camsonne, R., et al. (1993). "POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF C-11 MDL-72222, A POTENTIAL 5-HT3 RECEPTOR RADIOLIGAND - DISTRIBUTION, KINETICS AND BINDING IN THE BRAIN OF THE BABOON." Neuropharmacology 32(1): 65-71.

	The drug MDL 72222, a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, was labelled with C-11 and evaluated for distribution kinetics in brain and in vivo binding to 5-HT3 receptors using cold MDL 72222 challenge and positron emission tomography (PET), in three anaesthetized baboons. After tracer doses of [C-11]MDL 72222 (i.v. bolus), C-11 radioactivity was equally partitioned between plasma and blood cells and readily crossed the blood-brain barrier; it was distributed heterogeneously into 17 different structures of the brain. The kinetic curves for C-11 in tissue showed a rapid initial uptake, followed by a slower ascending phase, up to about the twentieth minute and by a plateau, until the end of experiment (90 min). The plateau values indicated marked uptake in brain which, however, varied according to the region considered. In inhibition studies with cold MDL 72222 (1 mg . kg-1) as pretreatment, co-injection or displacement, no clear-cut effects on the kinetics of [C-11] MDL 72222 in brain were detected in any region, including those known to be rich in 5-HT3 receptors. These observations suggest that specific binding to 5-HT3 receptors was not detectable in brain in vivo, because of the high lipophilicity (thus a great capacity for non-specific binding) of MDL 72222. These negative findings may also result from both the possible suboptimal affinity of MDL 72222 for 5-HT3 receptors in vivo and the relatively low density of 5-HT3 receptors present only in selected areas of the mammalian brain. This study is a step in the search of selective 5-HT3 receptor radioligands, adequate for in vivo applications. Slow clearance of [C-11]MDL 72222 from brain tissue in baboons, should be accounted for in clinical pharmacokinetic investigations for optimal posology considerations.
