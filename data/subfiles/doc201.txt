	Serotonin (5-HT) is an indirect modulator of the electric organ discharge (EOD) in the weakly electric gymnotiform fish, Brachyhypopomus pinnicaudatus. Injections of 5-HT enhance EOD waveform "masculinity", increasing both waveform amplitude and the duration of the second phase. This study investigated the pharmacological identity of 5-HT receptors that regulate the electric waveform and their effects on EOD amplitude and duration. We present evidence that two sets of serotonin receptors modulate the EOD in opposite directions. We found that the 5HT(1A)R agonist 8-OH-DPAT diminishes EOD duration and amplitude while the 5HT(1A)R antagonist WAY100635 increases these parameters. In contrast, the 5HT(2)R agonist (alpha-Me-5-HT increases EOD amplitude but not duration, yet 5-HT-induced increases in EOD duration can be inhibited by blocking 5HT(2A/2C)-like receptors with ketanserin. These results show that 5-HT exerts bi-directional control of EOD modulations in B. pinnicaudatus via action at receptors similar to mammalian 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2) receptors. The discordant amplitude and duration response suggests separate mechanisms for modulating these waveform parameters. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.
