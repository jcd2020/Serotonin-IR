	Objectives. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute modulation of the neurotrophin Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) by the novel antidepressant agomelatine and the relative contribution of its melatonergic and serotonergic receptor components. Methods. BDNF mRNA levels were measured in rat hippocampus and prefrontal cortex after acute administration of agomelatine, melatonin or the 5-HT2C antagonist S32006. Results. BDNF expression was significantly increased 16 h after acute agomelatine administration, an effect that follows a specific temporal profile, is limited to the prefrontal cortex and it is due to changes of specific neurotrophin transcripts. Moreover, the acute up-regulation of BDNF mRNA levels appears to be the result of a synergistic effect between the melatonergic properties of agomelatine as MT1/MT2 agonist and its serotonergic 5-HT2C antagonism, since either melatonin or the 5-HT2C antagonist S32006 does not mimic the effects of agomelatine. Conclusions. These data provide evidence that acute agomelatine treatment modulates the expression of BDNF through a functional interaction between melatonergic MT1/MT2 and serotonergic 5-HT2C receptors, supporting the notion that intracellular events can be regulated via a synergistic activity of different neuromodulatory systems.
