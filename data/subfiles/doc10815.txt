Rinaldi-Carmona, M., et al. (1994). "Identification of binding sites for SR 46349B, a 5-hydroxytryptamine2 receptor antagonist, in rodent brain." Life Sci 54(2): 119-127.

	SR 46349B belongs to a new class of compounds (propenone oxime ether derivative) that inhibit 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT)2 receptors in vitro and in vivo. (3H) SR 46349B has been shown to bind with high affinity (Kd = 1.20 nM) to a single class of sites in rat prefrontal cortical membranes. The maximum binding capacity (Bmax = 0.262 pmol/mg of protein) is similar to that found for other classes of 5-HT2 receptor antagonists. Although the highest density of specific (3H) SR 46349B binding was found in cortex tissue, specific binding was also detectable in other brain areas. Among various receptor or channel ligands [including alpha or beta adrenergic, dopamine (D1 or D2), histamine (H1 or H2), 5-HT subclasses (5-HT1, 5-HT3), muscarinic and Na+ and Ca2+ channel blockers] only 5-HT2 receptor effectors were able to displace (3H) SR 46349B. In addition, the type of inhibition exerted by known 5-HT2 receptor antagonists such as ketanserin and ritanserin was investigated by saturation studies. In vivo, (3H) SR 46349B bound predominantly in mouse brain regions containing 5-HT2 receptors. This binding was displaced by SR 46349B, ketanserin and ritanserin following oral administration. From these results we suggest that SR 46349B in its tritiated form is a useful tool to label the 5-HT2 receptor in vitro and in vivo.
