	INTRODUCTION: The serotonin 1B receptor subtype is of interest in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, anxiety, and migraine. Over recent years 5-HT1B receptor binding in human brain has been examined with PET using radioligands that are partial but not full agonists. To explore how the intrinsic activity of a PET radioligand may affect imaging performance, two high-affinity full 5-HT1B receptor agonists (AZ11136118, 4; and AZ11895987, 5) were selected from a large compound library and radiolabeled for PET examination in non-human primates. METHODS: [(11)C]4 was obtained through Pd(0)-mediated insertion of [(11)C]carbon monoxide between prepared iodoarene and homochiral amine precursors. [(11)C]5 was obtained through N-(11)C-methylation of N-desmethyl precursor 6 with [(11)C]methyl triflate. [(11)C]4 and [(11)C]5 were studied with PET in rhesus or cynomolgus monkey. [(11)C]4 was studied with PET in mice and rats to measure brain uptake and specific binding. Ex-vivo experiments in rats were performed to identify whether there were radiometabolites in brain. Physiochemical parameters for [(11)C]4 (pKa, logD and conformational energetics) were evaluated. RESULTS: Both [(11)C]4 and [(11)C]5 were successfully produced in high radiochemical purity and in adequate amounts for PET experiments. After intravenous injection of [(11)C]4, brain radioactivity peaked at a low level (0.2 SUV). Pretreatment with tariquidar, an inhibitor of the brain P-gp efflux transporter, increased brain exposure four-fold whereas pretreatment with a high pharmacological dose of the 5-HT1B antagonist, AR-A000002, had no effect on the binding. Ex-vivo experiments in rats showed no radiometabolites entering brain. [(11)C]5 also failed to enter monkey brain under baseline conditions. CONCLUSIONS: [(11)C]4 and [(11)C]5 show too low brain uptake and specific binding to be useful PET radioligands. Low brain uptake is partly ascribed to efflux transporter action as well as unfavorable conformations.
