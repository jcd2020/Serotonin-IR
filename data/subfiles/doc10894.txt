	In the 1990s, serotonin receptor agonist 5-HT1B/1D (the triptans) became available on the market for migraine treatment. Although the triptans are highly effective in aborting migraine attacks, the vasoconstrictor effect in cerebral and coronary territory limits their use. In the "post-triptans" era, new molecules, without vasoactive components are about to expand migraine treatment annamentarium, such as: serotonin 5-HT1F receptor agonists, calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonists (olcegepant, telcagepant) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting the CGRP, glutamate receptor (AMPA/kainate) antagonists, transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRV1) antagonists, nitric oxide (NO) synthesis inhibitors, prostanoid E4 receptor antagonists.
