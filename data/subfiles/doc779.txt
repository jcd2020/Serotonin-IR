Beique, J. C., et al. (2004). "Serotonergic regulation of membrane potential in developing rat prefrontal cortex: Coordinated expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A), 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors." Journal of Neuroscience 24(20): 4807-4817.

	The developing prefrontal cortex receives a dense serotonergic innervation, yet little is known about the actions of serotonin [5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] in this region during development. Here, we examined the developmental regulation of 5-HT receptors controlling the excitability of pyramidal neurons of this region. Using whole-cell recordings in in vitro brain slices, we identified a dramatic shift in the effects of 5-HT on membrane potential during the postnatal developmental period. In slices derived from young animals [ postnatal day (P) 6 to P19], administration of 5-HT elicits a robust depolarization of layer V pyramidal neurons, which gradually shifts to a hyperpolarization commencing during the third postnatal week. This progression is the result of coordinated changes in the function of 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptors, which mediate different aspects of the depolarization, and of 5-HT1A receptors, which signal the late developing hyperpolarization. The loss of the 5-HT7 receptor-mediated depolarization and the appearance of the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated hyperpolarization appears to reflect changes in receptor expression. In contrast, the decline in the 5-HT2A receptor depolarization with increasing age was associated with changes in the effectiveness with which these receptors could elicit a membrane depolarization, rather than loss of the receptors per se. Together, these results outline coordinated changes in the serotonergic regulation of cortical excitability at a time of extensive synaptic development and thus suggest a key role for these receptor subtypes in the postnatal development of the prefrontal cortex.
