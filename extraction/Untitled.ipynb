      "\tA role for serotonin alterations in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia has long been suspected because of the psychotogenic effects of serotonergic agonists and the therapeutic effects of 5-HT2 antagonism. This chapter is a review of the evidence derived from pharmacological studies, postmortem, and imaging studies that have assessed the role of serotonin transmission in schizophrenia. While a clear picture of specific serotonergic alterations in schizophrenia has not emerged despite much research, this review reinforces a modulatory role of serotonergic agents on dopamine transmission in schizophrenia, which may contribute to the therapeutic effects of atypical antipsychotics.\n",

      "\tAlterations in serotonergic and noradrenergic receptor binding in membrane homogenates from the brain of suicide victims suggest a biological substrate for the vulnerability to commit suicide. We and others have employed high-resolution quantitative autoradiography of full coronal sections of the prefrontal cortex to map the locus of maximal change in receptor binding. We found alterations in binding to the serotonin transporter, the 5-HT1A, and the 5-HT2A receptors primarily in the ventral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex of suicide victims. Importantly, these changes are often modest in magnitude and anatomically restricted to one or two Brodmann areas. Furthermore, we have found that care in case selection is essential, because sex, age, drugs, and comorbid diagnoses contribute to receptor binding. The implications for in vivo imaging are considerable, directing the focus of such studies toward the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. However, because ligands are limited, as is the resolution of current methods, including PET, automated analyses that produce statistical images, rather than manual selection of individual slices, will likely lack the ability to detect the discrete receptor changes found postmortem. Alternatively, the advantages of examining large numbers of subjects, imaging the entire brain, obtaining detailed clinical information in the living patient, and magnifying the changes with neuropharmacological challenges present a promising outlook for making major advances into the identification of brain abnormalities associated with suicide risk.\n",

      "\tThe appropriate treatment of depression is a major challenge in health policies, given the large prevalence of this psychiatric condition. Current antidepressant treatments have two main problems: slowness of action and limited efficacy. Ideally, antidepressants should exert most their clinical action in a relatively short time (e.g., 2 weeks) and be effective in the majority of treated patients. However, the most used antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) induce a clinical response (reduction to half of the initial severity) in only 60% of the patients after 6 weeks of treatment. Microdialysis studies over the last 15 years have helped to determine that the limited action of antidepressant drugs is partly due to negative feedback mechanisms involving 5-HT autoreceptors. The activation of such receptors by the excess 5-HT in the extracellular brain space reduces serotonergic cell firing and 5-HT release, thus attenuating the increase produced by reuptake inhibition. Chronic antidepressant treatment results in a progressive desensitization of these negative feedback mechanisms, enabling 5-HT neurons to recover their firing and release activities. This process is thought to play an important role in the delayed therapeutic action of antidepressants. This chapter reviews the use of the microdialysis technique to study the mode of action of SSRIs and other marketed (noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, serotonin, and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors) or potential antidepressant drugs (NK1 and CRF antagonists). Overall, microdialysis has largely contributed to the current knowledge on the mode of action of antidepressant drugs and to the development of potential new therapeutic strategies in the field.\n",

This suggests the existence of common neuropathological mechanisms behind depression and AD. Here we propose that the brain changes associated with depressive episodes that compromise the brain's ability to cope with stress may constitute risk factors for development of AD. Furthermore, in individuals with a genetic linkage to depression, there may be an increased vulnerability towards the initiation of a detrimental neurodegenerative cascade. The following review will deal with the various observations reported within the different neurobiological systems known to be involved and affected in depression, like serotonergic and cholinergic system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and brain derived neurotrophic factor, and discussed in relation to AD.\n",

      "\tAnorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are disorders characterized by aberrant patterns of feeding behavior, weight regulation, and disturbances in attitudes and perceptions toward body weight and shape. Several lines of evidence nominate disturbances of serotonin (5-HT) pathways as playing a role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of AN and BN. For example, 5-HT pathways are known to contribute to the modulation of a range of behaviors commonly seen in individuals with AN and BN. New technology using brain imaging with radioligands offers the potential for understanding previously inaccessible brain 5-HT neurotransmitter function and its dynamic relationship with human behaviors. Recent studies using positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography with 5-HT-specific radioligands have consistently shown 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor and 5-HT transporter alterations in AN and BN in cortical and limbic structures, which may be related to anxiety, behavioral inhibition, and body image distortions. These disturbances are present when subjects are ill and persist after recovery, suggesting that these may be traits that are independent of the state of the illness. Effective treatments for AN and BN have been elusive. A better understanding of neurobiology is likely to be important for developing specific and more powerful therapies for these often chronic and deadly disorders.\n",

In animals, high-dose administration of MDMA produces deficits in serotonin (5-HT) neurons (e.g., depletion of forebrain 5-HT) that have been Viewed as neurotoxicity. Recent data implicate MDMA In the development of valvular heart disease (VHD). The present paper reviews several issues related to MDMA-associated neural and cardiac toxicities. The hypothesis of MDMA neurotoxicity in rats is evaluated in terms of the effects of MDMA on monoamine neurons, the use of scaling methods to extrapolate MDMA doses across species, and functional consequences of MDMA exposure. A potential treatment regimen (L-5-hydroxytryptophan plus carbidopa) for MDMA-associated neural deficits is discussed. The pathogenesis of MDMA-associated VHD is reviewed with specific reference to the role of valvular 5-HT2B receptors. We conclude that pharmacological effects of MDMA occur at the same doses in rats and humans. High doses of MDMA that produce 5-HT depletions in rats are associated with tolerance and impaired 5-HT release. Doses of NIMM that fail to deplete 5-HT in rats can cause persistent behavioral dysfunction, suggesting even moderate doses may pose risks. Finally, the MDMA metabolite, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDA), is a potent 5-HT2B agonist which could contribute to the increased risk of VHD observed in heavy MDMA users.\n",

      "\tA very important element controlling serotonin (5-HT) release throughout the brain is the 5-HT1A autoreceptor present on the soma and dendrites of 5-HT neurons since it exerts a negative feedback influence on their firing activity, This 5-HT1A autoreceptor receives an increased activation by endogenous 5-HT at the beginning of a treatment with a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and, consequently, a decreased 5-HT neuronal firing activity is obtained. As the SSRI treatment is prolonged, the 5-HT1A autoreceptor desensitizes and firing activity is restored in the presence of the SSRI, That this adaptive change underlies, at least in part, the delayed therapeutic effect of SSRI in major depression is supported by the acceleration of the antidepressant response by the concomitant administration of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor antagonist pindolol with SSRIs.\n",

      "\tIn invertebrates, serotonin (5-HT) is involved in both non-associative and associative learning, and thus memory formation. Indeed, as shown in Aplysia californica, snails, leeches, etc., whereas the formation of memories is more difficult after 5-HT depletion, it is facilitated when serotonin functions are stimulated. Although it is generally considered that the evolution can be relatively conservative, the overall picture is much more complicated in higher vertebrates: when 5-HT systems are selectively damaged, the lesions have behavioral consequences, as can be evidenced, for instance, in rats or mice (e.g., on impulsivity), but learning is still possible, and most often memory capabilities appear normal. Serotonergic functions may also be enhanced by pharmacological tools, such as drugs inhibiting the reuptake of 5-HT (SSRIs). Although there is no consensus in the literature, SSRIs may have two types of effects according to whether they are given before or after training. When SSRIs are given before training, memory functions appear unchanged in some reports or altered in others; exceptionally, they can be improved. Given immediately after training, such drugs have no effect on memory or may improve it. In higher vertebrates, modifications of 5-HT functions have nevertheless consequences on the mnesic impact of treatments affecting other neurotransmitter functions, such as blockade of cholinergic receptors or cholinergic lesions. Therefore, with regard to learning and memory, one of the roles of the ascending serotonergic system taken as a whole could be to modulate more direct functional implications of other neurotransmitter systems. These modulations could operate in a region-specific and perhaps receptor-specific manner.\n",

      "\tThe observations that hallucinogenic drugs are in fact serotonin 5-HT2A receptor agonists and atypical antipsychotic drugs antagonize 5-HT2A receptors in addition to dopamine D-2-like receptors, led to envisage a close relationship between schizophrenia and serotonin transmission. Post mortem studies have shown diminished 5-HT2A receptor binding in brain tissue from people with schizophrenia. If these changes also occur in schizophrenia, the decreased 5-HT2A binding might be a compensatory effect resulting from increased cortical serotonergic transmission. Therefore, schizophrenic personality was associated to an excess of brain serotonin. Overall, such data suggests that 5-HT systems may play a role in the etiology and therapy of some aspects of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, there is no simple hypothesis of schizophrenia involving a single transmitter dysfunction in the brain. Thus, although initial views suggest increased serotonergic and dopaminergic transmission over 5-HT2A and D-2 receptors in schizophrenia, current hypotheses for both etiology and treatment of the disease also implicate 5-HT1A and D-2 receptor partial agonism in the development of novel antipsychotics with a better therapeutic profile and fewer adverse effects. In this chapter we review the role that serotonin and 5-HT2A receptors play in schizophrenia as well as the most relevant schizophreniarelated behavioral effects induced by hallucinogen drugs in rodents, focusing on those that involve a 5-HT2A receptor mechanism.\n",

The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT) neurotransmission system consists mainly of neurons in the brainstem, with nerve tracts extending from these neurons to many areas of the brain and spinal cord (5). During firing, the neurons release 5-HT, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the modulation of various important physiologic functions and behavior, such as thermoregulation, cardiovascular function, aggressive and sexual behavior, mood, appetite, and the sleep-wake cycle. The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which also contain several subtypes. There are five receptor subtypes within the G protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family with the 5-HT1A subtype located primarily in the limbic forebrain (the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and septum). 5-HT1A receptors appear to function both as presynaptic (somatodendritic) autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei and as postsynaptic receptors in the terminal fields. This receptor subtype is involved in the modulation of emotion and the function of the hypothalamus, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety, depression, hallucinogenic behavior, motion sickness, dementia, schizophrenia, and eating disorders. A radioligand that can be used to assess the in vivo densities of 5-HT1A receptors and their changes may facilitate investigation of the relationship of these receptors to various neuropsychiatric diseases and aid in the design of novel drugs for their treatment. Many psychiatric drugs modulate serotonergic transmission or specifically target the 5-HT1A receptors. Various compounds have been radiolabeled for visualization and quantification of these receptors. WAY 100635 was developed as a highly selective, silent antagonist (possessing no intrinsic agonist activity) of 5HT1A receptors at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites. WAY 100635 radiolabeled with (11)C at the carbonyl position is an effective radioligand but it is rapidly cleared and metabolized. The short t(1/2) of (11)C also presents some challenges in clinical application of the radiotracer. A radioligand with slower metabolism and labeled with a longer-lived radioisotope would be a better agent for quantitative PET studies. A number of fluorinated derivatives of WAY 100635 have been developed. Sandell et al.

It is a selective 5-HT1A agonist labeled with (11)C, a positron emitter with a physical half-life (t(1/2)) of 20.4 min (1, 2). The 5-HT neurotransmission system comprises mainly neurons in the brainstem, with nerve tracts extending from these neurons to many areas of the brain and spinal cord (3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which also contain several subtypes (4). There are five receptor subtypes within the G-protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family, with the 5-HT1A subtype located primarily in the limbic forebrain (the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex ,septum, and raphe) (4, 5). 5-HT1A receptors appear to function both as presynaptic (somatodendritic) autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei and as postsynaptic receptors in the terminal fields. This receptor subtype is involved in the modulation of emotion and the function of the hypothalamus, and it is implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety, depression, hallucinogenic behavior, motion sickness, dementia, schizophrenia, and eating disorders (6). A radioligand that can be used to assess the in vivo densities of 5-HT1A receptors and their changes may facilitate investigation of the relationship of these receptors to various neuropsychiatric diseases and aid in the design of novel drugs for their treatment. Many psychiatric drugs modulate serotonergic transmission or specifically target the 5-HT1A receptors (2). Various compounds have been radiolabeled for visualization and quantification of these receptors (7). 5-HT1A receptors appear to exist in the high (HA) and low (LA) agonist affinity states. Antagonist ligands bind to both the HA and LA conformations, whereas agonist ligands bind to the HA state, which is coupled to G-protein. WAY 100635 was developed as a highly selective, silent antagonist (possessing no intrinsic agonist activity) of 5-HT1A receptors at both pre- and postsynaptic sites. WAY 100635 radiolabeled with (11)C at the carbonyl position is an effective radioligand but it is rapidly cleared and metabolized. Analogs of WAY 100635 that bear bulkier cycloalkylcarbonyl groups appear to be more resistant to amide hydrolysis. However, the added lipophilicity also reduces receptor affinity (8). Although 5-HT1A receptor agonist ligands can elicit pharmacologic effects, there are some distinct potential applications of radiolabeled 5-HT1A receptor agonist ligands because they behave like serotonin, which binds preferentially to the HA sites (1, 9). Kumar et al. (1) selected MPT for development as a radiolabeled 5-HT1A receptor agonist probe because of its high affinity (pKi = 10.49) and favorable calculated lipophilicity (clogP = 1.8) (10, 11)\n",

It is a selective 5-HT1A antagonist labeled with (18)F, a positron emitter with a physical t(1/2) of 109.7 min (3, 4). The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) neurotransmission system consists mainly of neurons in the brainstem, with nerve tracts extending from these neurons to many areas of the brain and spinal cord. During firing, the neurons release 5-HT, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the modulation of various important physiologic functions and behavior, such as thermoregulation, cardiovascular function, aggressive and sexual behavior, mood, appetite, and the sleep-wake cycle.

A radioligand with slower metabolism and labeled with a longer-lived radioisotope would be a better agent for quantitative PET studies. A number of fluorinated derivatives of WAY 100635 have been developed. In 2000, Lang et al. (5) synthesized [(18)F]FPWAY with labeling at the carboxamide moiety to minimize metabolites that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). [(18)F]FPWAY appears to be an intermediate-affinity antagonist of the 5-HT1A receptors and may be more sensitive to transient changes in endogenous 5-HT1A levels than high-affinity analogs (6). In this WAY 100635 analog, the pyridine ring is replaced by pyrimidine and the cyclohexane ring is replaced by fluorobenzyl. With (18)F in the 4 position of the benzamide, [(18)F]FPWAY is a very different compound from another WAY 100635 analog with a similar abbreviation, [(18)F]6FPWAY, which was synthesized by Marchais et al.

      "\tSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), a derivative of the tryptophan amino acid, is a low molecular weight neurotransmitter that plays an important role in the functioning of different physiological, cognitive, and emotional processes. Impairment of the serotonergic system is associated with psychiatric disorders, such as anxiety and depression, and neurological afflictions, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy (1). The 5-HT mediates its biological activity through a group of seven receptors (5-HT1-7R) that are further classified into 14 distinct subtypes on the basis of their structure and pharmacological activity. Except for the 5-HT3R, which is a ligand-gated ion channel, all other 5-HTRs belong to the family of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors (2). Radiolabeled tracers have been developed for use with positron emission tomography (PET) to study the different 5-HTR subtypes, and much information is available regarding only the 5-HT1AR, 5-HT1BR, 5-HT2AR, and 5-HT4R subtypes (3). Compared to the discovery of the other 5-HTR subtypes, the identification of 5-HT6R is fairly recent, and this receptor is located mostly in the limbic and cortical regions of the mammalian central nervous system (4). Although the exact mechanism of action of the 5-HT6R is not clear, there are indications that antagonists of this receptor reverse amnesia and improve cognitive and memory functions in individuals suffering from schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, or Alzheimer's disease (5). Therefore, it was imperative to develop a ligand that could be used to study the biological characteristics of this receptor. Radioiodinated SB-258585 ([(125)I]-SB258585), a selective antagonist of the 5-HT6R, has been shown to have a high affinity for this receptor in membranes derived from rat or pig striatum and human caudate putamen (6). Autoradiography of rat brain sections exposed to [(125)I]-SB258585 revealed that the 5-HT6R was located primarily in the striatum, followed by the cerebral cortex; accumulation was lowest in the cerebellum of these animals. From this observation, the investigators concluded that the receptor was probably involved in cognition, memory, and locomotor control functions in the animals (7). In another study, [N-methyl]3-[(3-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-8-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)quinoline (GSK215083) was reported to have a 5-fold and >55-fold higher subnanomolar concentration affinity for the 5-HT6R compared to the concentrations required for the 5-HT2AR and the other 5-HTRs, respectively (3). In addition, the lipophilicity of GSK215083 was determined to be suitable for crossing the blood-brain barrier and penetration into the brain. On the basis of these observations, [(11)C]-GSK215083 was evaluated in vivo as a 5-HT6R ligand in pigs, non-human primates, and humans (3).\n",

      "\tNicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) belong to the \"Cys-loop\" superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels that includes GABA(A), glycine, and serotonin (5-HT3) receptors. There are 16 homologous mammalian nAChR subunits encoded by a multigene family. These subunits combine to form many different nAChR subtypes with various expression patterns, diverse functional properties, and differing pharmacological characteristics. Because cholinergic innervation is pervasive and nAChR expression is extremely broad, practically every area of the brain is impinged upon by nicotinic mechanisms. This review briefly examines the structural and functional properties of the receptor/channel complex itself. The review also summarizes activation and desensitization of nAChRs by the low nicotine concentrations obtained from tobacco. Knowledge of the three-dimensional structure and the structural characteristics of channel gating has reached an advanced stage. Likewise, the basic functional properties of the channel also are reasonably well understood. It is these receptor/channel properties that underlie the participation of nAChRs in nearly every anatomical region of the mammalian brain.\n",

It is densely expressed in the cortex and the hippocampus of rodents, primates and humans brain. A role of 5-HT2A receptors in learning and memory has been proposed for years. In some behavioural tasks in rodents, 5-HT2A receptors would display a constitutive activity, a spontaneous activity of the receptor occurring without the presence of the endogenous ligand and silenced by inverse agonists. Nonetheless, the demonstration of the existence of such a subtle activity in living organisms relies on specific criteria and on clear-cut pharmacological evaluation. While it has been claimed that 5-HT2A receptor constitutive activity participates in the conditioned eyeblink response in rabbits, such an activity would not be systematically observed in other models of learning and conditioning such as the conditioned avoidance response in rats. Here, we propose a thorough pharmacological analysis of the available data arguing in favour of the involvement of constitutive activity of 5-HT2A receptors, mostly in learning tasks and discuss the functional significance of such an activity.\n",

      "\tThere are four main obstacles in achieving optimal drug doses in the development of antidepressant drugs. The First is the large placebo response. This is known to be proportional to the initial severity of the illness such that subjects with less severe depressive illnesses show the greatest placebo response. Up to 40% of depressed patients with mid illnesses will spontaneously remit over 4 weeks of placebo therapy. Treatment with an effective antidepressant produces rates of 60-70% in this population. Thus, improvement directly attributable to a pharmacological action of the drug occurs in only 20-30% of treated patients. The second difficulty is that depression is probably heterogeneous in its response to antidepressant drugs. There is reasonable evidence that depression with psychosis is poorly responsible at least to existing antidepressant drug therapies but specifically responsive to electroconvulsive therapy. Patients with bipolar affective disorder may switch into mania when treated with antidepressant drugs and some bipolar patients develop chronic depression which is very resistant to drug therapy. The third difficulty, which is not unique to antidepressant drugs, is that 4 weeks of therapy is probably insufflicient to observe maximal response and improvement in depression may continue for 6-8 weeks. Improvement in other disorders such as obsessional compulsive disorder may continue well beyond 8 weeks. The fourth difficulty is that the pharmacological mechanism of action of antidepressants has some uncertainty and so it is difficult to develop in vivo surrogate markers. Modern imaging techniques offer a way forward. For example, new drugs can be investigated for their ability to displace radioligand binding to the receptor identified with antidepressant response. Positron emission tomography radioligands are being developed for monoamine reuptake sites and this could be used to optimise drug dosage with new monoamine uptake blocking antidepressants. There is a strong thrust of evidence which implicates post-synaptic 5HT1A receptor in mediating the antidepressant effects of drugs and these can already be visualised in using the radioligand WAY100635. The ability of antidepressant drugs to increase 5HT release could be detected by a displacement of WAY100635 by increased endogenous release of 5HT. Pharmaco magnetic resonance imaging is an emerging technology for dose optimisation of CNS drugs. The direct effect on neuronal metabolism in different regions of the brain can be monitored by following the local changes in blood flow. However, the technique is not yet quantitative. Another approach is to evoke regional neuronal activation using psychological tasks which engage different brain circuits or by the experimental induction of low mood itself.

      "\tIn this review, the functional interactions between serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) neuronal systems are discussed with the focus on microdialysis studies in the rodent brain (mainly rats). 5-HT by itself is involved both directly and indirectly via actions on complex neuronal circuitry, in the regulation of DA release through multiple 5-HT receptors, playing a critical role in the development of normal and abnormal behaviours. Recent evidence suggests that dysfunction of dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems contributes to various disorders including depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug abuse. Here we summarize recent neurochemical works that have extensively explored the role of 5-HT receptors in the control of DA central systems in both basal and drug-induced conditions, using in vivo microdialytic techniques. Several 5-HT receptor subtypes, including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, act to facilitate DA release, while the 5-HT2C receptor mediates an inhibitory effect of 5-HT on DA release. Taken together, neurochemical approaches using microdialysis can not only contribute to clarification of the physiological role of the serotonergic neuronal systems but may also be a powerful pharmacological approach for the development of therapeutic strategies to the treatment of depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and drug abuse.\n",

      "\n",
      "\tIn this paper it is argued that drugs of abuse act on specific neurotransmitter pathways and by this mechanism elicit neurochemical changes that mimic some aspects of the overall pattern of the neurochemical effects of natural rewarding stimuli. Thus, drugs of abuse are biochemically homologous to specific aspects of natural rewarding stimuli. The behavioural similarity between drugs of abuse and natural stimuli, including that of being rewarding, results from their common property of activating neurochemically specific pathways. Natural stimuli accomplish this result indirectly through their sensory properties and incentive learning while drugs stimulate by a direct central action the critical reward pathways. Many drugs of abuse mimic the incentive properties of natural stimuli and their ability to stimulate mesolimbic dopamine pathways (Fig. I). Both natural rewards and drugs of abuse, including amphetamine, cocaine and other psychostimulants, preferentially stimulate dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic nucleus accumbens compared with the dorsal caudate, an area related to the extrapyramidal motor system. Although many drugs of abuse mimic the incentive aspect of natural reward, this is probably not an absolute prerequisite for conferring to a drug some abuse liability. It might be predicted that certain drugs might be abused as a result of their action at sites located beyond dopamine or by mimicking other aspects of naturally rewarding stimuli such as the 'functional' (or trophotropic). This might be the case with opiates (which also mimic the 'incentive' aspect) and of benzodiazepines, as a result of activation of the central opioid reward system and of the central gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-benzodiazepine system respectively. The hypothesis appears to have heuristic value as it predicts that biochemical mechanisms important for the rewarding properties of drugs of abuse are expected to play a role also in natural reward. One test of this hypothesis is offered by the observation that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) system, through 5-HT3 receptors, and the central opioid system, through delta-opioid receptors, can contribute to the mechanism of the dopamine-activating properties of certain drugs of abuse. On this basis it would be predicted that drugs acting on 5-HT3 and on delta-opioid receptors would interfere with or mimic certain aspects of natural rewarding stimuli.\n",

      "\tAnorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are related disorders of unknown etiology that most commonly begin during adolescence in women. They are characterized by aberrant patterns of feeding behavior and weight regulation, and deviant attitudes and perceptions toward body weight and shape. In AN, an inexplicable fear of weight gain and unrelenting obsession with being fat, even in the face of increasing emaciation, accounts for a protracted course. BN usually emerges after a period of food restriction, which may or may not have been associated with weight loss. Binge eating is followed either by self-induced vomiting, or by other means of compensation for the excess of ingested food. There is growing acknowledgement that neurobiological vulnerabilities make a substantial contribution to the pathogenesis of AN and BN, suggesting that altered brain serotonin (5-HT) function contributes to dysregulation of appetite, mood, and impulse control. Brain imaging studies, using 5-HT specific ligands, show that disturbances of 5-HT function occur when people are ill, and persist after recovery. It is possible that a trait-related disturbance of 5-HT neuronal modulation predates the onset of AN, and contributes to premorbid symptoms of anxiety, obsessionality and inhibition. This dysphoric temperament may involve an inherent dysregulation of emotional and reward pathways which also mediates the hedonic aspects of feeding, thus making these individuals vulnerable to disturbed appetitive behaviors. Individuals with AN may discover that reduced dietary intake, by reducing plasma tryptophan availability, is a means by which they can modulate brain 5-HT functional activity and anxious mood. They enter a vicious cycle, because caloric restriction results in a brief respite from dysphoric mood. However, malnutrition and weight loss, in turn, produce alterations in many neuropeptides and monoamine function, which also exaggerates dysphoric mood. Thus, those with AN pursue starvation in an attempt to avoid the dysphoric consequences of eating.\n",

Chronic MAP abuse leads to psychosis, which may be of a transient or a prolonged type. Serotonergic dysfunction has been proposed as one of the contributory factors in the development of MAP psychosis. Our PET studies revealed that the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) density in global brain regions is significantly lower in MAP abusers. In this study, we examined the role of a functional polymorphism in the 5' flanking region of the 5-HTT gene (5-HTTLPR) in the development of MAP psychosis in a Japanese population. We analyzed DNA samples from 166 MAP patients (95 with transient and 71 with prolonged psychosis) and 197 age-, sex-, and geographic-origin-matched healthy controls. Patients were also subdivided according to the presence (n = 119) or absence (n = 148) of spontaneous relapse. We observed significant genotypic association of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism with MAP psychosis (P = 0.022), particularly in patients who show prolonged psychosis. The frequency of the S allele in patients with prolonged psychosis was significantly higher than that of the controls (P = 0.045); it was further higher in patients with prolonged psychosis with spontaneous relapse (P = 0.004). 5-HTTLPR has been suggested to regulate the transcriptional activity of 5-HTT, with S alleles showing lesser transcriptional efficiency and also lower 5-HT1A receptor-binding potential. Prolonged MAP use, combined with the high frequency of 5-HTTLPR S-alleles, may lead to reduced 5-HTT levels and 5-HT1A receptor-binding potential in the brain, resulting in the dysfunction of the serotonergic system. Thus, we suggest a possible role for the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in MAP psychosis.\r\n",

      "\tNicotine use carries considerable health risks and plays a major role in a variety of diseases. Current pharmacological treatments to aid in smoking cessation include nicotine-replacement therapy and non-nicotinic strategies such as bupropion and varenicline. While these treatments benefit some individuals there is still a need for better and more effective treatment strategies. Nicotine is the major psychoactive substance in tobacco. Some behavioural effects of nicotine, including its reinforcing efficacy result in part from activation of mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Modulation of dopamine function is one potential treatment strategy that could treat nicotine dependence. Serotonergic neurons modulate the functioning of dopamine neurons in a complex fashion. Much of this complexity arises from the fact that serotonin (5-HT) exerts its effects through multiple receptor subtypes, some of which even act in apparent functional opposition to each other. This article reviews evidence, primarily from animal experiments, using behavioural procedures relevant to nicotine use on the potential for 5-HT receptors as targets for treating nicotine dependence. The 5-HT1A, 2A, 2C, 3, 4, 6 receptor subtypes have received most experimental attention, with the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2C receptors being the best studied. Several studies have now shown that 5-HT1A receptor antagonists alleviate some of the behavioural signs induced by nicotine withdrawal. Electrophysiological and neurochemical studies show that stimulation of 5-HT2C receptors reduces the function of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. 5-HT2C receptor agonists block the stimulatory action of nicotine on midbrain dopamine function. They also reduce several behavioural effects of nicotine including its discriminative stimulus properties and reinforcing effects. Although more work remains to be done, 5-HT2C receptor agonists perhaps hold the most promise as potential therapies for smoking cessation.\r\n",

      "\tThe brain-gut axis is the bidirectional communication system that includes the central nervous system, the enteric nervous system, the wall and lumen of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. This active bidirectional highway links emotional and cognitive centers in the brain with the GI tract. In health, the brain-gut axis is important for regulating appetite, food intake, gut immune function, and the coordination of GI tract function with the emotional state of the organism. In a variety of disease states, the normal physiology of the brain-gut axis may be disturbed, and this can lead to changes in gut motility, secretion and immune function. Disruption of normal brain-gut axis physiology plays a role in the generation of many GI symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and constipation. These symptoms are commonly found in patients classified as having functional GI disorders (FGIDs). FGIDs are characterized by recurrent symptoms in GI tract that cannot be explained by currently available endoscopic, radiologic, or biochemical tests. FGIDs are highly prevalent; conservative estimates are that at least 40% of the population has symptoms of at least one FGID. To date, 28 separate FGIDs have been defined and characterized in adults, and this includes the two most clinically relevant FGIDs, irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia. For years, treatment for most FGIDs focused simply on medications that targeted the GI tract. Recognition of the key role that the brain-gut axis plays in symptom generation in FGID patients has opened up new avenues for therapeutic intervention. This review will briefly summarize new treatment options that focus on the brain-gut axis, with an emphasis on FGIDs. (C) 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel\r\n",

      "\tBoth serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) neurotransmitters play a key role in modulating synaptic transmission in the central nervous system. Such 5-HT- and DA-mediated modulatory activity has been shown to influence a wide variety of cerebral functions, both of an instrumental and cognitive nature. Some brain regions strongly involved in cognition such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampal formation and corpus striatum, are densely innervated by serotonergic and dopaminergic afferents proceeding from the raphe complex and the mesocorticolimbic or nigrostriatal systems, respectively. Learning and memory are strongly modulated by 5-HT and DA neurotransmitter activity, and in some cases they interact interdependently to sustain the psychobiological organization of these cognitive processes. Learning and memory, at least in part, depend on short- or long-lasting synaptic modifications, mainly occurring at dendritic spines. Indeed, the modulatory influence of 5-HT and DA at the synaptic level may affect the codification of mnemonic information on such spines. In fact, several experimental models of neurotransmitter activity have identified a close association between a 5-HT-DA imbalance and cytoarchitectonic changes underlying learning and memory impairment.\n",

AAAD gene and protein analyses have provided evidence for enzyme activity regulation at the transcriptional and post-translational levels. Extensive studies in neuronal tissues have demonstrated that AAAD activity is regulated by activation and induction, protein phosphorylation and gene transcription. A number of neurotransmitter receptors including dopamine (D1-4), glutamate (NMDA), serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors regulate AAAD activity in the rodent brain. Generally, receptor antagonists enhance AAAD activity; while, agonists have no effect or diminish it. Second messenger systems, particularly cAMP, participate in the short- and long-term enzyme regulation in the brain. Following a lesion of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons, AAAD in striatum responds more robustly to pharmacological manipulations indicating ability for compensatory responses. We provide a historical perspective of the current knowledge and review evidence supporting the notion that AAAD is a regulated enzyme. Because of the importance of AAAD for L-DOPA treatment in Parkinson disease, we propose that this knowledge can be exploited for the benefit of Parkinson patients.\n",

      "\tFibromyalgia is a clinical syndrome of chronic widespread pain and reduced pain thresholds to palpation. The pathophysiology remains unknown, but there is increasing evidence that peripheral and central sensitization cause an amplification of sensory impulses that may alter pain perception in fibromyalgia patients. Interventions to treat fibromyalgia should aim at different targets simultaneously in order to reduce peripheral and central sensitization. There are both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches with evidence for effectiveness in the treatment of fibromyalgia and its associated symptoms. Evidence from randomized trials and meta-analyses shows that partial and short-term improvements in fibromyalgia symptoms can be achieved with low doses of antidepressants and with physical activity such as aerobic and strengthening exercises. A multidimensional approach which emphasizes education and integration of exercise and cognitive behavior therapy improves quality of life and reduces pain, fatigue and depressive symptoms when measured on a short term basis. More recently, trials have shown the neuromodulators gabapentin and pregabalin to be effective in reducing pain and improving quality of sleep in fibromyalgia. In addition, small trials of noninvasive brain stimulation have also shown benefits in reducing pain in fibromyalgia. It is essential to keep in mind that some important clinical conditions can mimic and overlap with fibromyalgia and should always be ruled out by a complete history, physical examination and appropriate laboratory testing.

      "\tSeveral serotonin1A (5-HT1A) agonists and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been developed as new anxiolytics or antipanic agents. Until recently, no animal model has been available for screening the anxiolytic effect of SSRIs and studying its mechanism of action. The authors have investigated the relationship between 5-HT neurotransmission and anxiety using conditioned fear stress (CFS), an animal model of anxiety. CFS increased 5-HT neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex and amygdala, dependent on the intensity of CFS. Pharmacological studies showed that SSRIs, 5-HT1A agonists and monoamine oxidase inhibitors, which are assumed to facilitate 5-HT neurotransmission, decreased fear/anxiety in CFS. In vivo microdialysis studies displayed that increased prefrontal 5-HT metabolism by CFS reflected increased 5-HT release and this increased 5-HT neurotransmission was followed by a resolution of the freezing behaviour. These findings suggest that facilitation of brain 5-HT neurotransmission decreases anxiety in agreement with the clinical reports that SSRIs are effective in the treatment of anxiety disorders. Further CFS studies will contribute to our better understanding of the mechanism of anxiolytic action of serotonergic drugs and lead to the development of new treatment strategies for anxiety disorders.\n",

We obtained the following results: (1) Inhibitory effect of the potent D-2 agonist quinpirole on L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA was not detected in the denervated striatum; (2) reserpine pretreatment greatly reduced L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA; (3) additional serotonergic denervation to rats with dopaminergic denervation induced a significant reduction in L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA; and (4) activation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HT)(1A) receptors attenuated an increase in L-DOPA-derived extracellular DA. These results suggest that the conversion of exogenous L-DOPA to DA and the storage and release of converted DA occur in serotonergic nerve terminals when dopaminergic neurons are denervated. It is possible that serotonergic neurons play a critical role in the therapeutic effect of L-DOPA in Parkinson's disease. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.\n",

      "\tFatigue is evoked not only by peripheral factors, such as muscle fatigue, but also by the central nervous system (CNS). For example, it is generally known that the feeling of fatigue is greatly influenced by psychological aspects, such as motivation. However, little is known about the central mechanisms of fatigue. The clinical symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are shown to include disorders in neuroendocrine, autonomic, and immune systems. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that cytokines produced in the brain play significant roles in neural-immune interactions through their various central actions, including hypothalamo-pituitary and sympathetic activation, as well as immunosuppression. In this article, using the immunologically induced fatigue model, which was achieved by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of synthetic double-stranded RNAs, polyriboinosinic: polyribocytidylic acid (poly I:C) in rats, we show an involvement of brain interferon-a (IFN-alpha) and serotonin (5-HT) transporter (5-HTT) in the central mechanisms of fatigue. In the poly I:C-induced fatigue rats, expression of IFN-alpha and 5-HTT increased, while extracellular concentration of 5-HT in the medial prefrontal cortex decreased, probably on account of the enhanced expression of 5-HTT. Since the poly I:C-induced reduction of the running wheel activity was attenuated by a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, but not by 5-HT2, 5-HT3, or dopamine D-3 receptor agonists, it is suggested that the decrease in 5-HT actions on 5-HT1A receptors may at least partly contribute to the poly I:C-induced fatigue.\n",

In order to find genetic and molecular factors defining the sensitivity to thyroid hormones, the effects of chronic thyroxine (T4) treatment (2 mg/l, 60 days, in drinking water) on locomotor activity, anxiety-related, depressive-like behavior and freezing reaction (catalepsy) as well as on the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors in the brain were investigated in catalepsy-resistant AKR/J and catalepsy-prone ASC/Icg (Antidepressant Sensitive Catalepsy) strains. The latter was selectively bred for the high predisposition to catalepsy from intercross between CBA/Lac and AKR/J parental strains. In AKR mice T4 increased predisposition to catalepsy and locomotion in the open field test compared with the respective controls, but did not affect forced swim immobility. In contrast, in ASC mice T4 significantly decreased predisposition to catalepsy and immobility time in the forced swim test without any effect on locomotion in the open field. No influence of T4 on anxiety-related behavior in mice of these strains was shown. T4 treatment significantly increased head-twitch response to 5-HT2A receptor agonist, DOI (1 mg/kg, ip) and the receptor mRNA level in the cortex in AKR, but not in ASC mice. Although the hormone did not affect 5-HT1A receptor mRNA level in the hippocampus and midbrain of ASC mice, a marked attenuation of hypothermic effect of 5-HT1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT (1 mg/kg, ip) in the T4-treated ASC was found. It was suggested that the cortical 5-HT2A receptor mediated the T4-induced activation of locomotion, while the 5-HT1A receptor was involved in the anticataleptic and antidepressant effects of the hormone. The results indicate that hereditary predisposition to catalepsy can predict behavioral effect of chronic T4 treatment in mice.\r\n",

      "\tNewer atypical antipsychotic drugs such as risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole that have been modelled on the prototype agent clozapine and developed since the 1990s are now referred to as second-generation antipsychotic drugs (SGAs). It has been proposed that the interaction between serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine systems may play a critical role in the mechanism of action of atypical antipsychotic drugs because a relatively potent blockade of 5-HT2A receptors coupled with the weaker antagonism of the dopamine D-2 receptors is found to be the only pharmacological feature which most atypical antipsychotic drugs have in common. This so-called 'serotonin-dopamine hypothesis' has become a useful model for developing new SGAs to achieve superior antipsychotic efficacy with a lower incidence of extrapyramidal side effects compared to those with first-generation antipsychotic drugs (FGAs) such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine, although it has not been validated yet. In contrast, it has been proposed as the alternative 'fast-off' theory according to which atypical profile of SGAs can be determined by the loose D-2-binding kinetics alone, while the blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor may be neither necessary nor sufficient. This chapter reviews the current issues on the serotonin-dopamine hypothesis together with further advances in research on the role of 5-HT receptor subtypes in the mechanism of action for SGAs. In particular, SGA-induced dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex, possibly through the functional activation of 5-HT1A receptors by 5-HT2A and D-2 receptor-mediated interaction, has been thought to be the basis for the neurocognitive effects of these drugs on schizophrenia. Thus, the novel antipsychotic aripiprazole may not only be a simply partial D-2 agonist but also a significant 5-HT1A agonist and 5-HT2A antagonist. These complex properties of antipsychotic aripiprazole may contribute to dopaminergic activation of the local circuitry in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic patients.\r\n",

      "\tThree decades on from Blundell's suggestion that serotonin serves to orchestrate endogenous satiety, we present an overview of the behavioral, pharmacological and neurological evidence that underpins our understanding of the role of serotonin in the control of appetite. Early human and rodent studies, many using fenfluramine, provided initial support for the hypothesis. The more recent characterization of serotonin receptor subtypes, the development of selective pharmacological probes, and the use of transgenic mice unable to express certain 5-HT receptor subtypes has identified specific roles for the 5-HT2C, 5-HT1B and 5-HT6 receptor subtypes in feeding behavior. It has also provided support for the development of 5-HT2C receptor agonists as a treatment for obesity. Serotonin acts at multiple brain sites to enhance satiety; these include the nucleus of the solitary tract and lateral parabrachial nucleus in the brainstem and hypothalamic sub-regions such as the arcuate and paraventricular nuclei. There are important interactions between serotonin- and hypothalamic peptide-containing cells, especially those expressing alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone and Neuropeptide Y. Serotonin also has important interactions with cholecystokinin at the brainstem level. The multiplicity of these interactions has been reflected in the realization that serotonin has multiple influences at the behavioral level, which range from the mediation of short-term satiation in response to gastric distension and the presence of gut nutrients, to modulation of the responses evoked by conditioned cues that lead to the initiation of feeding.\r\n",

Dopamine receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia (3). Five subtypes of dopamine receptors, D1-5, have been well characterized pharmacologically and biochemically (4). These five subtypes have been classified into two subfamilies of D1-like (D1, D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, D4) dopamine receptors. D1-Like and D2-like receptors exert synergistic as well as opposite effects at the biochemical and overall system levels. A great majority of striatal D1 and D2/3 receptors are localized postsynaptically on the caudate-putamen neurons, and to a lesser extent presynaptically on nigrostriatal axons. On the other hand, D4 receptors are mostly found in the extrastriatal regions of the brain, such as the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and medulla. These areas are believed to control emotion and cognition. In addition to D2 receptors, D4 receptors may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, as suggested by clinical studies of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine in patients (5, 6). Clozapine is not only effective against positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but it is also efficacious against the negative symptoms. Clozapine has a 10-fold greater affinity for D4 receptors than for D2 receptors (7). However, it also has high affinities for 5-HT1A,1B,2A,2C,6,7, alpha1A,2A,2C, muscarinic M1, and histamine H1 receptors. The neurophysiological role of D4 receptors remains to be defined. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of D4 receptors. There have been several attempts to develop specific D4 radioligands for use with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of D4 receptors (8-10). However, none has proved suitable because of a lack of selectivity, extremely low D4 receptor density in the brain, and other pharmacological issues. Lacivita et al. (11) reported that N-[2-[4-(3-cyanopyridin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-3-methoxybenzamide (compound 7) is a potent inhibitor (agonist) of D4 receptors, with >100-fold selectivity over D2 and D3 receptors.

However, it also has high affinities for 5-HT1A,1B,2A,2C,6,7, alpha1A,2A,2C, muscarinic M1, and histamine H1 receptors. The neurophysiological role of D4 receptors remains to be defined. Thus, there is a need to for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of D4 receptors. There have been several attempts to develop specific D4 radioligands for use with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of D4 receptors (8-10). However, none has proved suitable because of a lack of selectivity and other pharmacological issues. Kugler et al. (11) reported that 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-4-((6-fluoropyridin-3-yl)methyl)piperazin e (3d) is a potent antagonist of D4 receptors, with >1,100-fold selectivity over D2 and D3 receptors. This led to the development of 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-4-((6-[(18)F]fluoropyridin-3-yl)methyl)pi perazine ([(18)F]3d) as a potential D4 receptor radioligand for use with PET imaging of D4 receptors in the brain.\r\n",

The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are five receptor subtypes within the G-protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family: 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F. 5-HT7 receptors are abundantly present in the hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus; low densities are observed in the cortex and amygdala (5-7). 5-HT7 receptors are involved in the mediation of emotion and the function of the hypothalamus. 5-HT7 receptors are implicated in anxiety, depression, hallucinogenic behavior, circadian rhythms and sleep, memory, epilepsy, and pain. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of 5-HT7 receptors. 1-(2-{(2R)-1-[(2-[(18)F]Fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]pyrrolidin-2-yl}ethyl)-4-methylpipe ridine ([(18)F]-2FP3) was evaluated as a positron emission tomography (PET) probe for 5-HT7 receptors because the unlabeled 2FP3 was found to be a selective 5-HT7 antagonist with nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor.\r\n",

      "\tDopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays an important role in the mediation of movement, cognition, and emotion (1, 2). Dopamine receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and schizophrenia (3). Five subtypes of dopamine receptors, D1-5, were well-characterized pharmacologically and biochemically (4). These five subtypes were classified into two subfamilies of D1-like (D1, D5) and D2-like (D2, D3, D4) dopamine receptors. D1-like and D2-like receptors exert synergistic as well as opposite effects at the biochemical and overall system levels. A great majority of striatal D1 and D2/3 receptors are localized postsynaptically on the caudate-putamen neurons and to a lesser extent presynaptically on nigrostiatal axons. On the other hand, D4 receptors are mostly found in the extrastriatal regions of the brain, such as the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and medulla. These areas are believed to control emotion and cognition. Beside D2 receptors, D4 receptors may play an important role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia from clinical studies of the atypical neuroleptic clozapine in patients (5, 6). Clozapine is not only effective against positive symptoms of schizophrenia but also is efficacious against the negative symptoms. Clozapine has a 10-fold greater affinity for D4 than for D2 receptors (7). However, it also has high affinities for 5-HT1A,1B,2A,2C,6,7, alpha1A,2A,2C, muscarinic M1 and histamine H1 receptors. The neurophysiologic role of D4 receptors remains to be defined. Thus, there is a need to for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological role of D4 receptors. There have been several attempts to develop specific D4 antagonists for PET radioligands for D4 receptors (8-10). However, none has proved suitable because of lack of selectivity and other pharmacological issues. Unangst et al.

In the brain, 5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei of the cerebellum, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and amygdala. 5-HT2C receptors are found in the choroid plexus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

This led to the development of 5-methyl-8-(4-[(11)C]methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide ([(11)C]AZ10419369) as a useful tool for in vivo PET imaging of the 5-HT1B receptor (11).\r\n",

      "\tSerotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiologic roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). It is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which include several subtypes (4). There are three receptor subtypes within the G protein-coupled 5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A receptors are involved in mediation of normal and psychotic states, working memory, regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep, peripheral pain, and cardiovascular functions. 5-HT2B receptors are found mainly in several peripheral tissues, such as the stomach, intestine, and pulmonary smooth muscle, and in the myocardium. In the brain, 5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei of the cerebellum, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and amygdala. 5-HT2C receptors are found in the choroid plexus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacologic role of 5-HT2A receptors. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT2A radioligands, such as [(11)C]ketanserin (6), [(18)F]spiperone (7), [(11)C]methylspiperone ([(11)C]NMSP), and [(18)F]setoperone [PubMed], for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, none has proven specific for 5-HT2A receptors because these compounds also bind to other receptors, such as dopamine receptors and 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was reported to be a potent inhibitor of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (8, 9). This led to the development of 3-[2-[4-(4-[(18)F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-on e ([(18)F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (10).\r\n",

Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacologic role of 5-HT1A receptors. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT1A radioligands [PubMed] for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, such as [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY 100635, [(18)F]FPWAY, and [(18)F]MPPF.

However, a relatively slow washout of radioactivity from the human brain likely reflects the accumulation of radiometabolite(s) in human brain (9).

      "\tMalfunction of the sympathetic nervous system may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of heart diseases. There are two subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors, alpha1 and alpha2, in the heart. alpha-Adrenoceptors play a backup role for beta1-adrenoceptors (1). The cardiac adrenoceptors are responsible for the regulation of heart rate and myocardial contractility (2). About 15% of cardiac adrenoceptors are alpha1-adrenoceptors. Presynaptic alpha1-adrenoceptors modulate noradrenalin release. alpha1-Adrenoceptors are present predominately in larger blood vessels, whereas alpha2-adrenoceptors are more prominent in smaller blood vessels. Increases in alpha1-adrenoceptor sites are usually observed when the number of beta-adrenoceptors decreases in heart diseases (3). Imaging of the pathologic changes of adrenergic receptors offers a non-invasive assessment of myocardial diseases. In the brain, high densities of alpha2-adrenoceptors are in the hippocampus, amygdala, basal ganglia, cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, and hypothalamus (4). Changes in alpha2-adrenoceptor function have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, movement disorders, and depression (4, 5). (R,S)-1,2,3,4,10,14b-Hexahydro-2-methylpyrazino(2,1-a)pyrido(2,3-c) (2)benzazepine (mirtazapine) is active at central alpha2-adrenoceptors with proven clinical efficacy in the treatment of depression [PubMed]. It also is an antagonist to 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors based on in vivo pharmacologic studies in animals (6). However, the antidepressant effects of mirtazapine are attributed primarily to inhibition of alpha2-adrenoceptors (7). Mirtazapine plays a role in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. To clarify any putative changes and to define the anatomical distribution of alpha2-adrenoceptors in vivo, [(11)C]mirtazapine is being developed as a positron emission tomography (PET) agent for the non-invasive study of antidepressant actions on alpha2-adrenoceptors in the brain.\r\n",

      "\tIt is well known that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is a brain region in which virtually all abused drugs exert rewarding effects by activating its dopamine neurons. We recently found that the tumour suppressor enzyme phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) directly interacts to a region in the third intracellular loop (3L4F) of serotonin 5-HT2C receptors (5-HT2cR) in the rat VTA. PTEN limits agonist-induced 5-HT2cR phosphorylation via its protein phosphatase activity. Systemic or intra-amygdaloid application of the interfering peptide Tat-3L4F is able to disrupt PTEN coupling with 5-HT2cR in the rat VTA, resulting both in a suppression of the increased firing rate of VTA dopaminergic neurons induced by Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, and in a blockade of the conditioned place preference induced by THC and nicotine [Ji, S. P. et al. (2006). Nat. Med., 12: 324-329]. Because the blockade effects of Tat-3L4F peptide on the conditioned preference could be achieved by the suppression of Tat-3L4F peptide on the rewarding and/or learning/memory mechanisms associated with conditioned place preference, we recently explored whether Tat-3L4F can affect learning and memory. We observed that Tat-3L4F did not produce significant effects on spatial learning and memory in a Morris water maze test, thus indicating that Tat-3L4F can effectively suppress the rewarding effects induced by drugs of abuse.\n",

      "\tSerotonin research has resulted in the identification of up to 14 receptors in the brain. A real challenge is to develop experimental strategies and methods that can be used to investigate the role of these receptors in the integrated function of the serotonergic systems in the animal and human brain in vivo. There are now methods available that can measure in vivo functional changes in extracellular serotonin (microdialysis, voltammetry). However, with microdialysis temporal and spatial resolution is limited, and while voltammetry has the capability to improve on both these limitations, development of suitable readily usable electrodes is still required. The serotonin transporter and some serotonin receptors can be monitored using positron emission tomography (PET), but work is still required to develop new and better ligands for other receptors. Tryptophan depletion studies can be effectively used to investigate altered serotonergic function in subjects with an underlying trait dysfunction, though its ability to be used to investigate the role of serotonin in normal function remains debatable. Magnetic resonance imaging techniques, in particular fMRI combined with selective pharmacological interventions, offer an exciting new approach to investigating the interactions between serotonin pathways and other neurotransmitters in integrated behavioral responses.\n",

      "\tA clear concept of epileptic zones remains of high clinical relevance in presurgical evaluation of refractory epilepsy patients and in resection planning. Recent advances in understanding how each of the epileptic zones is functionally organized strengthened the importance of the network concept. It has been shown that neuronal networks underlying the individual epileptic zone may involve multiple brain structures with complex interactions between them. The network concept has impact not only for better understanding of pathophysiology of partial epilepsy but also for clinical practice, particularly for epilepsy surgery. This review examines recent reports on the use of advanced imaging techniques which enable to map the epileptic zones and their structural and functional organization. Magnetic resonance postprocessing substantially improved the accuracy in detection of the epileptogenic lesions. The seizure-onset zone is primarily determined by electrophysiology but can also be localized using single photon emission computed tomography. The functional deficit zone is commonly assessed by a number of tests including methods of functional neuroimaging (positron emission tomography) which can delineate hypometabolic cortical areas and subcortical structures. Hemodynamic fluctuations associated with interictal epileptiform discharges can be detected by novel functional magnetic resonance technique which is nowadays widely used for the irritative zone localization. These techniques open new prospect for epilepsy surgery in patients who were previously considered as not suitable candidates of surgical treatment.\n",

      "\tThe serotonergic transmission is considered as a neuromodulatory system in the Central Nervous System. 5-HT1B receptors play an important role in this modulatory activity. We have purified from mammalian brain an endogenous peptide, LSAL, me called 5-HT-moduline, interacting specifically with 5-HT1B receptors. This interaction is characterized by a high affinity (K-i = 10(-10) M) and a non-competitive mechanism. Direct [H-3]5-HT-moduline binding revealed a single population of sites having an apparent affinity constant close to 10(-10) M. Autoradiographic studies showed a brain distribution of [H-3]5-HT-moduline binding sites closely related to the 5-HT1B receptors. In functional studies, the peptide is able to reverse the activity of a 5-HT1B agonist in the nanomolar range. Furthermore, this antagonist effect is also observed in vivo on mice behavior. Immunocytochemistry revealed an heterogeneous distribution of 5-HT-moduline in mouse brain, The labeled structures correspond to cellular profiles with axon-like prolongations. Moreover, in vitro, LSAL is released in a Ca++, K+-dependent manner. Therefore, 5-HT-moduline behaves as a neurotransmitter. The fact that 5-HT-moduline induces the desensitization of 5-HT1B receptors reflects the existence of a novel and efficient mechanism able to rapidly modulate the serotonergic activity.\n",

Hence, in this paper an attempt was made to summarize recent findings. Available evidence indicates that diverse 5-HT6 receptor antagonists produce promnesic and/or antiamnesic effects in diverse conditions, including memory formation, age-related cognitive impairments, memory deficits in diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Notably, some 5-HT6 receptor agonists seem to have promnesic and/or antiamnesic effects. At the present, it is unclear why 5-HT6 receptor agonists and antagonists may facilitate memory or may reverse amnesia in some memory tasks. Certainly, 5-HT6 drugs modulate memory, which are accompanied with neural changes. Likewise, memory, aging, and AD modify 5-HT6 receptors and signaling cascades. Further investigation in different memory tasks, times, and amnesia models together with more complex control groups might provide further clues. Notably, human studies suggest a potential utility of 5-HT6 receptor antagonists in mild-to-moderate AD patients.

      "\tPsychopharmacologic studies of aggressive behavior in animals under controlled laboratory conditions have been instrumental in developing and evaluating specific and effective novel drug treatments that reduce aggressive behavior. An initial contribution of this research is to create experimental conditions that enable the display of aggressive and defensive acts and postures in species that engage in either dominance or territorial or maternal aggression. Quantitative ethological analyses allow the precise delineation of the sequential organization of aggressive bursts, providing a benchmark for assessing excessive or pathological forms of aggressive behavior. A second contribution of preclinical research is the development of experimental models of escalated forms of aggressive behavior, such as focusing on genetic predispositions or social provocations and frustrative experiences. A critical role of preclinical research is in the pharmacological and neurochemical analysis of aggressive behavior; for example, a host of undesirable side effects prompted a shift from classic dopaminergic neuroleptic compounds to the more recently developed atypical neuroleptics with effective and more specific anti-aggressive effects. The long-established role of brain serotonin in impulsive and escalated forms of aggressive behavior continues to be a focus of preclinical studies. New evidence differentiates dynamic state changes in corticolimbic serotonergic neurons during the termination of aggressive behavior from the deficient-serotonin trait in violence-prone individuals. It can be anticipated that currently developed tools for targeting the genes that code for specific subtypes of serotonin receptors will offer new therapeutic options for reducing aggressive behavior, and the 5-HT1B receptor appears to be a promising target. The modulation of GABA and GABA(A) receptors by 5-HT in corticolimbic neurons promises to be particularly relevant for specific forms of escalated aggressive behavior such as alcohol-heightened aggression.\n",

      "\tNo other drug has been associated with aggressive and violent behavior more than alcohol has. A major characteristic of the link between alcohol and social interactions is the very large variation in who becomes more aggressive while drinking and who does not. Tracing the origins of these individual differences has led to a focus on predispositions, such as the antisocial behavior of Type 2 alcoholics. Successful development of an experimental procedure to model heightened aggressive behavior after voluntary consumption of alcohol has facilitated the neurobiologic analysis of the link between alcohol and aggression. From a pharmacologic perspective, consumption of low to moderate doses of alcohol engenders heightened aggressive behavior in a significant minority of individuals before the circulation of appreciable amounts of the aldehyde metabolite. Ionophoric receptors such as NMDA, 5-HT3 and GABA(A) have been identified in the brain as major sites of action for alcohol in the dose range that is relevant for engendering heightened aggression. Actions at the GABA(A) receptor complex that depend on particular GABA(A) subunits appear to be necessary for alcohol-heightened aggression. Genes that encode the synthesis of these alpha and gamma subunits are potentially significant markers for those individuals that are prone to engage in heightened aggressive behavior after the consumption of alcohol. Of particular importance are the reciprocal interactions between GABA and serotonin. Activating specific serotonin receptor subtypes such as 5-HT1B receptors reduces alcohol-heightened aggressive behavior. How these GABAergic and serotonergic corticolimbic mechanisms for alcohol-heightened aggression develop during the adolescent period remains an area of urgent study.\n",

The contribution of metabotropic glutamate receptors type 5 (mGlu5 receptors) in PD and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias (LID) was the topic of investigations in human PD patients and in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkeys. Behaviorally, it has been shown that the prototypical mGlu5 antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) as well as the mGlu5 receptor antagonists 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) and mavoglurant (AFQ056) acutely attenuated LID in MPTP monkeys. Moreover, a chronic 1-month administration of MPEP to previously drug-naive MPTP monkeys (de novo treatment) attenuated the development of LID. Acute and chronic MPEP treatments of MPTP monkeys maintained the antiparkinsonian effect of L-DOPA. Mavoglurant was also shown in some clinical studies to reduce LID in PD patients. Using the selective mGlu5 receptors ligand [H-3]ABP688, mGlu5 receptor-specific binding was measured by autoradiography in brains slices of normal and PD patients in relation to motor complications associated with an L-DOPA treatment. PD patients with motor complications (either LID or wearing-off) had higher [H-3]ABP688-specific binding compared to those without motor complications and controls in putamen, external and internal globus pallidus. In monkeys with a MPTP lesion and controls, [H-3]ABP688- and [H-3] MPEP-specific bindings were elevated in the striatum of dyskinetic L-DOPA-treated MPTP monkeys but not in MPTP monkeys without LID compared to controls. The brain molecular correlates of the long-term effect of a 1-month administration of MPEP with L-DOPA that attenuated the development of LID were shown to extend beyond mGlu5 receptors. In the basal ganglia, it has been showed that the L-DOPA-induced changes of NMDA and AMPA ionotropic glutamate receptors as well as mGlu2/mGlu3 receptors were prevented with the addition of MPEP. Moreover, MPEP normalized the L-DOPA-induced changes of dopamine D2 receptors, their associated signaling (ERK and Akt) and neuropeptides (preproenkephalin, preprodynorphin), as well as the serotonin receptors 5-HT2A and 5-HT1B. In conclusion, these results have shown in humans and in a nonhuman primate model of PD reduction of LID with mGlu5 antagonism. In the basal ganglia, LID were associated with changes of various glutamatergic, dopaminergic, and serotoninergic markers that were normalized with adjunct treatment with an mGlu5 antagonist supporting the mGlu5 receptor as a good target for the treatment of LID.\n",

Given the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in virtually all behaviors and brain plasticity at cellular, molecular and systems levels, one can readily assume a 5-HT contribution to the establishment and maintenance of addiction-related behaviors and their neuronal mechanisms. In this chapter we review the role of the 5-HT system in addiction-related behaviors for major addictive drugs, such as cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA (ecstasy), morphine, heroin and nicotine. We discuss the impact of these drugs on 5-HT activity, and how this activity might translate into behavior by activating 5-HT receptors. The effects of serotonergic manipulations on addiction-related behaviors in animal models and in human therapy of addiction are reviewed. Intensive research has shown that drug-induced 5-HT activation does not have a uniform 'proactive effect' (i.e., neurochemical activity that triggers behavioral activation) on addiction-related behavior, but might often serve a 'counteractive function', thus limiting the expression of behavior which is driven by other neurochemical effects of the drug. 5-HT receptors can have very different effects on addiction-related behaviors depending on their localization in the brain, the cell type, and the synapse. Some receptor populations do appear to have proactive effects - i.e., translate the drug-induced 5-HT increase into addiction-related behaviors - while others counteract them, or are not involved. While acknowledging this complexity will be important for an understanding of the 5-HT role in drug addiction, it also provides a challenge to the use of 5-HT system components for therapy in humans.\n",

      "\tThe role of brain amyloid in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is discussed controversially, but combined genetic and biochemical evidence points to a central role of the gene encoding the amyloid precursor APP in at least some forms of AD. This article proposes that preventing brain amyloid formation is a rational concept for drug treatment of AD. We suggest that pharmacologically active ligands for specific cell surface receptor subtypes-normally stimulated by neurotransmitters, growth factors, and cytokines-constitute a class of chemicals that might be useful to accelerate processing of APP into non-amyloidogenic, and biologically active, derivatives. This class of agents includes muscarinic m1 and m3 agonists, serotoninergic 5-HT2a and 5-HT2c agonists, glutamatergic mGluR1 agonists, as well as agonists for bradykinin and vasopressin receptors.\r\n",

      "\tIt has been suggested that impulsive behavior is caused by dysfunctional serotonergic 5-HT neurotransmission in the central nervous system (CNS). Brain neuroimaging studies have shown that behavioral inhibition is linked to the activation of cortex sites such as the ventral frontal cortex. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [F-18]altanserin to characterize 5-HT2A receptor binding revealed a reduction in 5-HT2A binding in the ventral frontal cortex in women who had recovered from impulsive diseases. These clinical, neuroimaging, and pharmacological studies appear to support the hypothesis that functional alteration of neurotransmission due to genetic polymorphisms of the 5-HT receptors may be involved in impulsive behavior modulation. Following evaluation by a self-reporting measure, it was proposed that a polymorphism in the promoter of the 5-HT2A receptor gene is the underlying cause of impulsive behavior; however, this hypothesis is not convincing. We examined whether the polymorphism in the 5-HT2A receptor gene promoter is involved in impulsive aggression by evaluating a behavioral task (Go/No-go task) in normal volunteers. The polymorphism of the 5-HT2A receptor gene promoter in lymphocytes from 71 volunteers was analyzed by using PCR. Impulsivity was defined as the number of commission errors (responding when one should not) recorded during a Go/No-go task; a larger number of commission errors indicate greater difficulty in inhibiting impulsive behavior. The subjects of the A-1438A allele group for the 5-HT2A receptor gene made more commission errors under the punishment-reward (PR)condition in a Go/No-go task than those in the G-1438G group. In the present review, we discuss and suggest the possible involvement of the A-1438A polymorphism of the 5HT2A receptor gene promoter in impulsive behavior. This hypothesis was evaluated by using a behavioral task measure that could directly reveal impulsive behavioral traits in humans.\r\n",

      "\tShort sleep duration has been suggested to be a risk factor for weight gain and adiposity. Serotonin (5-HT) substantially contributes to the regulation of sleep and feeding behavior. Although 5-HT predominately promotes waking and satiety, the effects of 5-HT depend on 5-HT receptor function. The 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors reportedly contribute to sleep waking regulation, whereas the 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors contribute to the regulation of satiety. The 5-HT1B and 2C receptors may therefore be involved in the regulation of sleep feeding. In genetic studies, 5-HT1B receptor mutant mice display greater amounts of rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) than wild-type mice, while displaying no effects on waking or slow wave sleep (SWS). On the other hand, 5-HT2C receptor mutant mice exhibit increased wakefulness and decreased SWS, without any effect on REMS. Moreover, the 5-HT2C receptor mutants display leptin-independent hyperphagia, leading to a middle-aged onset of obesity, whereas 5-HT1B receptor mutants do not display any effect on food intake. Thus, the genetic deletion of 5-HT2C receptors results in sleep loss-associated hyperphagia, leading to the late onset of obesity. This is a quite different pattern of sleep feeding behavior than is observed in disturbed leptin signaling, which displays an increase in sleep-associated hyperphagia. In pharmacologic studies, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors upregulate wakefulness and downregulate SWS, REMS, and food intake. These findings suggest that 5-HT1B/2C receptor stimulation induces sleep loss-associated anorexia. Thus, the central 5-HT regulation of sleep feeding can be dissociated. Functional hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin and orexin activities may contribute to the dissociated 5-HT regulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.\r\n",

      "\t5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) is a major neurotransmitter involved in the modulation of behavior, the manifestation of various psychiatric disorders, and is a pharmacological target in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. The physiological effects of serotonin are modulated by a variety of proteins that regulate its synthesis, storage, release, uptake and degradation. In addition, serotonin signaling is mediated by at least 14 distinct receptors. Alterations in the expression of genes that regulate the biological effects of serotonin in the brain could alter serotonergic signaling, and thus could ultimately alter behaviors where serotonin has been implicated. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the behavioral consequences of manipulation of genes that regulate serotonergic signaling in rodents and to review analogous genetic association studies in humans that relate to psychiatric disorders, with a particular focus on depression and anxiety disorders. Many of these studies provide supportive evidence of a role for the serotonergic system in various behavioral responses related to depression and anxiety, as well as other psychiatric disorders. In particular, dysfunction of tryptophan hydroxylase, the serotonin transporter (SERT) or 5-HT1A receptors can induce behaviors in rodents that are associated with anxiety and depression, and can also alter behavioral responses to antidepressant treatments. Moreover, many of these findings are supported by human genetic association studies. Studies in rodents also suggest that interference with SERT or 5-HT1A receptor function specifically during brain development can program anxiety levels and depression in adulthood. Finally, while some evidence suggests that other components of the serotonergic system might also play important roles in these disorders, such findings remain to be refined using genetically modified mice, selective pharmacological tools or human genetic association studies.\r\n",

      "\tThe serotonergic system in the central nervous system (CNS) has complex interactions with many, if not all other neurotransmitter systems in the brain. Its localization, distribution and amazing receptor diversity makes it an appealing system for modulatory aspects in many basic behaviors, including sexual and aggressive behaviors. Notwithstanding decades of research into the putative role of the serotonin (5-HT) system in aggression and sex, no clear picture has emerged. In aggression, depending on state or trait, 5-HT is involved in either the performance or its termination. Application of drugs, and particular selective ligands for certain receptors, suggests a specific role for the (postsynaptic) 5-HT(1B) and to a lesser extent, the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the modulation of (offensive) aggression. In sexual behavior, the role of 5-HT is less well studied. Here, 5-HT(1A) receptor activation and blockade of 5-HT(2C) receptors are prosexual, whereas 5-HT(1B) receptor activation is inhibitory. Selective serotonergic uptake inhibitors have no acute effects on sexual behavior but are inhibitory after chronic administration. The role of serotonin in aggression and sexual behavior most likely involves different, partly overlapping, neurochemical systems, suggesting that independent networks in both behavioral systems are differentially influenced by serotonergic tone influencing various 5-HT receptors.\r\n",

      "\tThere has been significant recent growth in programmes evaluating preventive treatment for individuals exhibiting prodromal symptoms, at high risk of developing first-episode psychosis. Because of the tremendous human and economic burden of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, primary prevention modalities of even modest impact would likely have important public health consequence. Several published clinical trials suggest that antipsychotic medications have beneficial effects in either preventing or postponing the emergence of first-episode psychosis in individuals at high risk of psychosis. It is not clear, however, that antipsychotic drugs are the most effective, or safest, pharmacological treatment for psychosis prevention. Mechanisms for primary prevention (intervening to remove a cause of illness) and treatment are not necessarily similar. All of the medications developed for treatment of psychosis rely on tertiary prevention, and there is no a priori reason to assume that these treatments would be the safest and most effective primary preventive treatment of first-episode psychosis. Evidence suggests that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin 5-HT2A and dopamine D3 receptor antagonists, mood-stabilizing medications, GABAergic, glutamatergic and neuroprotective compounds may also be beneficial primary prevention drugs for first-episode psychosis. While there are indications that effective preventive interventions are feasible, data on safety and efficacy of primary preventive treatment interventions are limited and published studies highlight the enrolment challenges facing efforts to identify the safest and most effective preventive treatment interventions through human clinical trials. Treatments preventing behavioural alterations using developmental animal models with relevance to limbic system neurobiology could therefore be useful in focusing hypotheses regarding effective treatments for psychosis prevention. In one such study, low-dose risperidone pre-treatment prevented behavioural abnormalities following neonatal hippocampal lesions, while higher risperidone pre-treatment was ineffective. These findings support the predictive validity of the neonatal hippocampal lesion model in identifying psychosis prevention interventions, provide theoretical support for the use of low-dose risperidone in prevention of first-episode psychosis and suggest the possibility that higher risperidone doses could be less effective than low dosages in this application. These observations also suggest a potential role for selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonists as drug development targets for psychosis prevention.\n",

      "\tThe use of 'agonist therapy' for cocaine and methamphetamine addiction involves administration of stimulant-like medications (e. g. monoamine releasers) to reduce withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse. A significant problem with this strategy is that many candidate medications possess abuse liability due to activation of mesolimbic dopamine (DA) neurons in the brain. One way to reduce DA-mediated abuse liability of candidate drugs might be to add in serotonin (5-HT)-releasing properties, since substantial evidence shows that 5-HT neurons provide an inhibitory influence over mesolimbic DA neurons. This chapter addresses several key issues related to the development of dual DA/5-HT releasers for the treatment of substance use disorders. First, we briefly summarize the evidence supporting a dual deficit in DA and 5-HT function during withdrawal from chronic cocaine or alcohol abuse. Second, we discuss data demonstrating that 5-HT release can dampen DA-mediated stimulant effects, and the 'anti-stimulant' role of 5-HT2C receptors is considered. Next, the mechanisms underlying potential adverse effects of 5-HT releasers are described. Finally, we discuss recently published data with PAL-287, a novel non-amphetamine DA/5-HT-releasing agent that suppresses cocaine self-administration but lacks positive reinforcing properties. It is concluded that DA/5-HT releasers could be useful therapeutic adjuncts for the treatment of cocaine and alcohol addictions as well as for obesity, attention deficit disorder and depression.\n",

      "\tThe molecular diversity of cloned serotonin receptor subtypes in the brain makes it difficult to understand the specific modulatory roles played by different receptors. In order to understand the role of the 5-HT1B receptor subtype in behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders, we have been studying genetic knockout mice lacking the 5-HT1B receptor. The 5-HT1B knockout mice show evidence of increased aggression and impulsivity, behavioral patterns that area also associated with reduced 5-HT function. They also show reduced or absent locomotor stimulation to some serotoninergic drugs, indicating that the locomotor effects of these drugs require the 5-HT1B receptor. However, in some cases, data obtained with knockout mice conflicts with the pharmacological data. The 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice show a phenotype of increased vulnerability to drugs of abuse such as cocaine. However, pharmacological studies suggest that 5-HT1B stimulation enhances the effects of cocaine, while 5-HT1B blockade can attenuate some of the effects of cocaine. Compensations that enhance dopamine function appear to be responsible for the drug-vulnerable phenotype of 5-HT1B receptor knockout mice. By studying these compensations and changes in neural function, we can learn more about the fundamental mechanisms underlying addiction. The 5-HT1B knockout mice should be considered a model for the disease state of vulnerability to drugs of abuse, rather than a direct pharmacological model of 5-HT1B receptor function.\n",

      "\tSerotonin (5-HT)(2C) receptors play a major role in the regulation of mood, and alteration of their functional status has been implicated in the etiology of affect disorders. Correspondingly, they represent an important target for various antidepressant categories, including tricyclics, tetracyclics, mCPP derivatives, specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and agomelatine, which exhibit medium to high affinities for 5-HT2C receptors and behave as antagonists. Antidepressant effects of 5-HT2C antagonists have been attributed to a disinhibition of mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic pathways, which exert a beneficial influence upon mood and cognitive functions altered in depression. However, recent experimental evidence revealed a prominent role of constitutive activity in the tonic inhibitory control of dopaminergic transmission exerted by 5-HT2C receptors in specific brain areas such as the nucleus accumbens. Accordingly, alteration in the constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptors might participate in the induction of depressed states and drugs with inverse agonist properties should themselves be effective antidepressant agents and, possibly, more active than neutral antagonists. This highlights the relevance of systematically evaluating inverse agonist versus neutral antagonist activities of antidepressants acting at 5-HT2C receptors. Here, we provide a detailed description of a palette of cellular assays exploiting constitutive activity of 5-HT2C receptor expressed in heterologous cells (such as HEK-293 cells) toward Gq-operated signaling or their constitutive association with beta-arrestins to evaluate inverse agonist activity of antidepressants. We also describe an approach allowing discrimination between inverse agonist and neutral antagonist activities of antidepressants at native constitutively active receptors expressed in cultured cortical neurons, based on previous findings indicating that prolonged treatments with inverse agonists, but not with neutral antagonists, induce functional 5-HT2C receptor-operated Ca2+ responses in neurons.\n",

Daily administration of morphine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) for 10 days resulted in dependence of rats as seen by loss of analgesic response. On the 11th day, no morphine administration was given. This resulted in profound withdrawal symptoms 24 h after morphine withdrawal. The magnitude and severity of these symptoms were increased further 48 h after withdrawal. Measurement of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, a measure of perturbed brain fluid microenvironment showed leakage of Evans blue and radioiodine tracers in several parts of the brain in rats showing withdrawal symptoms. Whereas, rats treated with AP-267 either on the 1st day or 2nd day morphine withdrawal showed much less symptoms and leakage of the BBB. Taken together, these observations suggest that (a) stress associated with the withdrawal symptoms are sufficient enough to induce breakdown of the BBB function, and (b) modulation of serotonin 5-HT2c receptors may have some protective influence on the stress symptoms and the BBB disruption.\n",

These autoreceptors are implicated in depression and anxiety neurobiology, and form the basis of various ongoing 5-HT drug discovery efforts in these therapeutic areas. Recent experiments have discovered further complexity of 5-HT neuron control, specifically in the form of postsynaptic feedback mechanisms. These mechanisms have the physiological effects of 5-HT autoreceptors but use additional 5-HT receptor subtypes, and operate via neural inputs to 5-HT neurons. There is also recent evidence for postsynaptic feedback systems that excite 5-HT neurons. The postsynaptic feedback mechanisms are also providing a new source of drug targets for therapeutic application. Overall, current data suggest the presence of a previously unsuspected, complex arrangement of pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT receptor-mediated feedback mechanisms that control 5-HT neuron function.\n",

      "\tTourette syndrome (TS) is a heritable neuropsychiatric disorder that presents in childhood with a constellation of motor and non-motor symptoms. The defining feature of the disorder is the presence of brief, stereotyped, motor or vocal behaviours called tics. Although tics are themselves voluntary, they are typically performed secondary to involuntary sensory symptoms or irresistible urges. TS is therefore said to be a disorder of human volition that likely represents a general failure of inhibition. It shares many features with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and impulse control disorder with which it is also commonly associated. Much of the anatomic substrate for TS probably lies in the circuits that connect multiple areas of cortex with the basal ganglia and thalamus to subserve motivation, inhibition of behaviour, planning of motor acts and detection of threats. To date, pathological studies of TS have been very few and the number of subjects evaluated too small to reliably elucidate the nature and significance of several reported abnormalities. However, evidence derived from both pharmacological trials and selected functional imaging studies suggests that disturbances of the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmitter systems play a key role in the pathogenesis of TS. At the same time, multiple studies have demonstrated reciprocal interactions between the serotonin and dopamine systems of the brain. This information, when placed in the context of the observed functional imaging abnormalities, may generate further insights into the pathophysiology of TS.\n",

It is a selective 5-HT1A antagonist radiotracer labeled with (11)C, a positron emitter with a physical t(1/2) of 20.4 min (2). The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT) neurotransmission system consists mainly of neurons in the brainstem, with nerve tracts extending from these neurons to many areas of the brain and spinal cord (3). During firing, the neurons release 5-HT, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the modulation of various important physiological functions and behavior, such as thermoregulation, cardiovascular function, aggressive and sexual behavior, mood, appetite, and the sleep-wake cycle (1). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven classes of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), and many of which also contain several subtypes (4). There are five receptor subtypes within the G protein-coupled 5-HT1 receptor family, and the 5-HT1A subtype is primarily located in the limbic forebrain (the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and septum) (1, 4). It appears to function both as presynaptic (somatodendritic) autoreceptors in the raphe nuclei and as postsynaptic receptors in the terminal fields. This receptor subtype is involved in the modulation of emotion and the function of the hypothalamus, and is implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety, depression, hallucinogenic behavior, motion sickness, dementia, schizophrenia, and eating disorders (5). A radioligand that can be used to assess the in vivo densities of 5-HT1A receptors and their changes may facilitate investigation of the relationship of these receptors to various neuropsychiatric diseases and aid in the design of novel drugs for their treatment. Many psychiatric drugs modulate serotonergic transmission or specifically target the 5-HT1A receptors (2). Many compounds have been radiolabeled and studied for visualization and quantification of these receptors using PET or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Selective agonists such as 8-hydroxy-N-N-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were initially studied, but because they bind to the relatively few 5-HT1A receptors in the high-affinity state, the higher affinity required in that situation was difficult to achieve (6). WAY 100635 has been developed as a highly selective, silent antagonist (possessing no intrinsic agonist activity) of 5HT1A receptors at both presynaptic and postsynaptic sites (7). The initial radiolabel was placed in the O-methoxy position, but studies have shown that this [O-methyl-(11)C] radioligand is metabolized by in vivo amide hydrolysis in primates to a lipophilic radiolabeled amine metabolite that can cross the blood-brain barrier with high affinities for both alpha1-adrenoceptors and 5-HT1A receptors (8, 9). The labeling of WAY 100635 with (11)C in its carbonyl position provides the current [carbonyl-(11)C]WAY 100635 radioligand which avoids the formation of the undesirable radiolabeled metabolite (8, 10).\n",

In addition, oleamide alone caused a significant increase in cAMP accumulation that was dependent on the presence of the 5-HT7 receptor, but was not blocked by clozapine. These results demonstrate that oleamide can have diverse effects on 5-HT-mediated signal transduction at different subtypes of mammalian 5-HT receptors, Additionally, our data suggest that oleamide may act at an allosteric site on the 5-HT, receptor and can elicit functional responses via activation of this site.\n",

      "\tIn anxiety research, the search for a model with sufficient clinical predictive validity to support the translation of animal studies on anxiolytic drugs to clinical research is challenging. The stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH) model studies the body temperature increase in response to acute stress which is mediated by the autonomic nervous system. This SIH response occurs in all mammals including humans, is easy to measure, reproducible and stable over time. The SIH paradigm has proven to possess excellent predictive validity, and various anxiolytic drugs have been shown to dose-dependently reduce the SIH response, including GABA(A)-receptor (subunit) agonists, 5-HT1A receptor agonists, mGlu5 receptor antagonists and CRF receptor antagonists. Therefore, the SIH model is a simple and attractive paradigm to study putative anxiolytic drug properties as well as the effects of genetic or brain manipulations. In the SIH procedure, drugs arc injected 60 minutes before the actual stressor, consisting of a manual rectal temperature measurement (T-1). After 10 minutes, a second manual rectal temperature measurement is taken (T-2), which represents the stress-induced body temperature. The SIH (Delta T) response is the difference between T-2 and T-1 (Delta T=T-2-T-1). As drugs might exert intrinsic effects on the basal body temperature (measured via T-1), the SIH response has to be interpreted in the context of absolute body temperatures. Mice can be repeatedly used (up to a year) if tested once a week because the SIH response remains very stable over Such elongated periods. Animals can be socially housed except for the actual testing day (starting the day before until immediately after the procedure) when mice have to be singly housed.\n",

      "\tPutative 5-ht(5) receptor binding sites were visualized by in vitro autoradiography using [I-125]LSD tin the presence of clozapine and spiperone) or [H-3]5-carboxamidotryptamine tin the presence 8-OH-DPAT, GR127935 and spiperone), Under these conditions, no [H-3]5-carboxamidotryptamine labeling was detected in the brain of mice lacking the gene encoding the putative 5-ht(5a) receptor (knockout mice), whereas intermediate densities of binding sites were seen in the olfactory bulb and neocortex of wild-type mice. [I-125]LSD labeled the same areas as [H-3]5-carboxamidotryptamine in wild-type mice. High densities of [I-125]LSD binding sites were observed in the medial habenula of wild type and knockout mice. 5-CT competed for [I-125]LSD binding sites with an affinity of 2 nM in the olfactory bulb and neocortex of wild-type mice and an affinity of 30 nM in the habenula of knockout mice, suggesting that habenular labeling might be accounted for by putative 5-ht(5b) receptors. In the presence of 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, 5-CT displaced [I-125]LSD from putative 5-ht(5a) and 5-ht(5b) sites with a 6-times and 3-times lower affinity respectively, suggesting that both receptor subtypes are coupled to G proteins in brain. We also studied the inhibitory effect of 5-CT on dural neurogenic inflammation in knockout mice, In wild type mice, 3 ng/kg 5-CT inhibited dural protein extravasation by 60 %. A similar effect was observed in knockout mice, even in the presence of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist GR127935. These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of 5-CT are not mediated by a site with the characteristics of the putative 5-ht(5) receptor.\n",

      "\tWe investigated the effect of fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), on L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA)-derived extracellular dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum of rats with nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation using in vivo microdialysis. Treatment with fluoxetine (10 mg/kg i.p.) induced a 41% reduction in the cumulative amount of extracellular DA during 300 min following L-DOPA administration (50 mg/kg i.p.). This effect was antagonized by pretreatment with WAY-100635, a potent 5-HT1A antagonist, indicating that this effect of fluoxetine is due to its 5-HT1A agonistic property. These results suggest that SSRIs may impair motor functions in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) by reducing efflux of exogenous L-DOPA-derived DA. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

      "\tThis review discusses the location, possible mechanisms, interaction and therapeutic possibilities and possible psychiatric influences of the serotonergic receptors 5-HT1A - 5-HT7. It concludes that, although some of the mechanisms of these receptors are widely accepted, their involvements in diseases and their roles in therapeutics are still elusive. Even with their locations, it was only recently perceived that 5-HTIA and 5-HT2A had different localizations in the brainstem, thus making functional correlations possible in due course. In order that a clearer picture or these receptors can emerge, further studies are much needed.\r\n",
